summary: Chickens are the easiest livestock. Produce eggs daily, meat when butchered. Require shelter, feed (grain or forage), water. Hens lay without rooster (unfertilized eggs). 3-6 hens provide eggs
  for small family.
warnings:
- Predators (foxes, hawks, raccoons) kill chickens - secure coop required
- Chickens carry Salmonella - wash hands after handling
- Roosters are loud - may anger neighbors
- Feeding only scraps produces weak eggs - need protein and calcium
steps:
- 'HOUSING: Coop with nest boxes, roosts, protection from predators and weather. 4 sq ft per bird inside, 10 sq ft outdoor run.'
- 'FEEDING: Layer pellets (commercial) or mixed grains (wheat, corn) + protein (insects, worms, meat scraps) + calcium (crushed shells, oyster shell). Free-range chickens forage 50 percent of diet.'
- 'EGGS: Hens lay 200-300 eggs per year (peak 1-3 years old, decline after). Collect daily. Unwashed eggs last weeks at room temp.'
- 'MEAT: Butcher roosters or old hens. Processing same as wild turkey (see entry).'
- 'DISEASES: Keep coop clean, dry, well-ventilated. Separate sick birds. Most backyard flocks are healthy if managed well.'
