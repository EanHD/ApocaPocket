summary: Raise fish in ponds for food. Tilapia (warm water, easy), catfish (hardy, fast-growing), trout (cold water). Requires pond (natural or dig), feeding, water quality management. Harvest fish as needed.
  High protein yield from small space.
warnings:
- Fish ponds can attract predators (herons, raccoons, otters) - netting required
- Poor water quality (low oxygen, high ammonia) kills fish rapidly
- Freezing kills warm-water fish (tilapia) - cover pond or move indoors in winter
- Overstocking causes disease and stunted growth
steps:
- 'POND CONSTRUCTION: Natural pond (spring-fed, creek) or dig pond (line with clay or plastic liner). Size: 100 sq ft per 10 fish (minimum). Depth 3-4 feet (deeper in cold climates to prevent freezing).'
- 'SPECIES SELECTION: TILAPIA - Fast-growing, warm water (70-85F), breed rapidly. Best for warm climates. CATFISH - Hardy, tolerate crowding, cold-tolerant. TROUT - Require cold water (50-60F), high oxygen.
  CARP - Very hardy, omnivorous, but bony.'
- 'STOCKING: Fingerlings (young fish) from hatchery or wild-caught. Stock 1 fish per 10 gallons (conservative). More = faster growth but requires feeding and water management.'
- 'FEEDING: Natural food (insects, algae, zooplankton) supports some fish. Supplement with commercial pellets, or grain, vegetable scraps. Feed daily (what they consume in 5 min).'
- 'WATER QUALITY: Oxygen essential (aerate with waterfall, fountain, or air pump). Test ammonia (toxic) - change water if high. Algae bloom (green water) indicates nutrients - good for fish but excessive
  blocks oxygen.'
- 'HARVEST: Net fish as needed or drain pond (harvest all). Process like wild fish (gut, cook thoroughly).'

Raise fish in ponds for food. Tilapia (warm water, easy), catfish (hardy, fast-growing), trout (cold water). Requires pond (natural or dig), feeding, water quality management. Harvest fish as needed. High protein yield from small space.
