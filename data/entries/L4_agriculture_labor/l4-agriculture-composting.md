summary: Compost turns organic waste (kitchen scraps, leaves, manure) into rich soil amendment. Improves soil structure, adds nutrients, feeds soil life. Hot composting (fast, 2-3 months) vs cold composting
  (slow, 6-12 months). Balance green (nitrogen) and brown (carbon) materials.
warnings:
- Compost pile can smell if too wet or too much green material
- Meat, dairy, oils attract pests - do not compost (or use hot composting only)
- Diseased plant material can spread disease - do not compost or use hot composting (kills pathogens)
steps:
- 'MATERIALS: GREEN (nitrogen - wet, fresh): kitchen scraps (vegetables, fruit), grass clippings, fresh manure, green leaves. BROWN (carbon - dry): dead leaves, straw, wood chips, cardboard. RATIO: 2-3
  parts brown to 1 part green (by volume).'
- 'HOT COMPOSTING: (1) Build pile 3x3x3 feet minimum (needs mass to heat up). (2) Layer green and brown. (3) Water until damp (like wrung-out sponge). (4) Turn pile weekly (adds oxygen). (5) Pile heats
  to 55-65C (kills weed seeds, pathogens). (6) Ready in 2-3 months (dark, crumbly, earthy smell).'
- 'COLD COMPOSTING: Pile materials, leave alone. Decomposes slowly (6-12 months+). Less work but does not kill weed seeds.'
- 'TROUBLESHOOTING: SMELLS BAD - Too wet or too much green. Add brown material, turn pile. TOO DRY - Add water and green material. NOT HEATING - Too small (add more material) or needs turning.'
- 'USING COMPOST: Spread 2-4 inches on garden beds. Mix into soil. Top-dress around plants. Mulch. Improves any soil (clay, sand, depleted).'
