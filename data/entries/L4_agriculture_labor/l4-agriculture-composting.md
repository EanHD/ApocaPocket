# Composting - L4 Agriculture

**Priority: HIGH** | **Difficulty: Easy-Medium** | **Impact: Build topsoil in 3-5 years vs 100+ naturally**

## Overview

Composting converts waste into black gold. Nature takes 100-1000 years to build an inch of topsoil; hot composting does it in 3-6 months. This is the foundation of permanent food production without external inputs.

## Hot vs Cold Composting

| Method | Time to Finish | Effort | Kills Pathogens? | Kills Weed Seeds? |
|--------|---------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Hot Compost** | 3-6 months | High (weekly turning) | ✅ Yes (130-160°F) | ✅ Yes (>140°F) |
| **Cold Compost** | 12-24 months | Low (occasional turning) | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Vermicompost** | 3-6 months | Low (maintenance) | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No |

**Choose Hot Composting For:** Speed, pathogen/seed kill, animal manures, diseased plants
**Choose Cold Composting For:** Low effort, continuous adding, small amounts
**Choose Vermicomposting For:** Indoor, small-scale, high-quality output, no space

## The Carbon-Nitrogen Ratio (C:N)

**Target Ratio: 30:1** (30 parts carbon to 1 part nitrogen by volume)

### Browns (Carbon) - "The Energy"
- Dry leaves
- Straw/hay
- Shredded paper/cardboard (non-glossy)
- Sawdust (hardwood, not treated)
- Pine needles (slow to break down)
- Corn stalks, dried plant matter

**Appearance:** Dry, brown, crunchy

### Greens (Nitrogen) - "The Protein"
- Fresh grass clippings
- Food scraps (vegetable/fruit)
- Coffee grounds (+ filters)
- Animal manure (aged)
- Fresh plant trimmings
- Seaweed

**Appearance:** Wet, green, soft

### Balancing Table

| Material | C:N Ratio | Category |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food scraps | 15:1 | Green |
| Grass clippings | 20:1 | Green |
| Coffee grounds | 20:1 | Green |
| Chicken manure | 10:1 | Green (hot!) |
| Cow manure | 20:1 | Green |
| Horse manure | 25:1 | Balanced |
| Straw | 80:1 | Brown |
| Dry leaves | 60:1 | Brown |
| Shredded paper | 175:1 | Brown |
| Sawdust | 500:1 | Brown (use sparingly) |

**Rule of Thumb:** 3 parts browns to 1 part greens by volume (browns are fluffy, greens dense)

## Hot Composting Protocol

### Setup Requirements
- **Minimum size:** 3ft × 3ft × 3ft (1 cubic yard)
  - Smaller piles don't retain heat
  - Larger works better (up to 5ft cube)
- **Location:** Level ground, partial shade, good drainage
- **Structure:** Wire bin, pallets, or open pile

### Lasagna Layering Method

**Layer 1 (Bottom):** 6" coarse browns (sticks, corn stalks) - aeration
**Layer 2:** 3" greens (food scraps, fresh manure)
**Layer 3:** 6" browns (leaves, straw)
**Layer 4:** 3" greens
**Layer 5:** 1" soil or finished compost (introduces microbes)
**Repeat** until pile is 3-4 feet tall

**Moisture:** Squeeze test - should feel like wrung-out sponge
- Too dry: Add water while building
- Too wet: Add more browns

### Temperature Monitoring

| Phase | Days | Temperature | Action |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Heating** | 0-3 | 70°F → 130°F | Monitor daily |
| **Active** | 3-14 | 130-160°F | Maintain, turn when drops |
| **Peak** | Peak day | 140-160°F | IDEAL (pathogen kill) |
| **Cooling** | 14-30 | 160°F → 100°F | Turn weekly |
| **Curing** | 30-90 | 100°F → ambient | Turn monthly |

**⚠️ CRITICAL TEMPERATURES:**
- **130-140°F:** Weed seeds killed
- **140-160°F:** Most pathogens killed (optimal)
- **>160°F:** Beneficial microbes die (turn pile to cool)

**Measuring:** Use compost thermometer (probe 12-18" deep into center)

### Turning Schedule

**Purpose:** Re-introduce oxygen, redistribute materials, restart heating

**Hot Compost Turning:**
1. **First Turn:** Day 3-5 (when temp drops from peak)
2. **Second Turn:** Day 7-10
3. **Third Turn:** Day 14-17
4. **Weekly:** Until pile stops reheating (4-8 weeks)

**Technique:**
1. Move outer material to center (undecomposed)
2. Break up clumps
3. Check moisture (add water if dry)
4. Rebuild pile compactly

**Troubleshooting:**

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Pile won't heat | Too small | Add more material (min 1 cubic yard) |
| Pile won't heat | Too dry | Add water while turning |
| Pile won't heat | Wrong ratio | Add greens (nitrogen) |
| Smells like ammonia | Too much nitrogen | Add browns, turn pile |
| Smells rotten | Too wet / no oxygen | Add browns, turn pile |
| Attracts pests | Exposed food | Bury food scraps, add browns |

### Cold Composting Protocol

**Setup:** 
- Same structure as hot (wire bin, pallets)
- Smaller piles acceptable (2ft × 2ft minimum)

**Method:**
1. Add materials continuously (don't wait to build full pile)
2. Layer greens and browns roughly 1:3
3. Turn every 4-6 weeks (or never, just add to top)
4. Harvest from bottom after 12-24 months

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Don't add diseased plants
- ❌ Don't add meat, dairy, fats (pests)
- ❌ Don't add pet waste
- ❌ Don't add weeds with seeds

**Advantages:**
- Low effort (pile-and-forget)
- Continuous process
- No monitoring

## Vermicomposting (Worm Bins)

**Best For:** Apartments, kitchens, small-scale, winter composting

### Setup
**Container:** 
- Plastic tote (18-20 gallon)
- Drill 1/4" holes in lid and upper sides (airflow)
- Drill drain holes in bottom (sit on tray)

**Bedding:**
- Shredded newspaper/cardboard (moistened)
- Coconut coir (excellent)
- 4-6" depth

**Worms:**
- **Species:** Red wigglers (*Eisenia fetida*) - NOT nightcrawlers
- **Quantity:** 1 lb worms = eat 1/2 lb food/day (1000-2000 worms)
- **Source:** Purchase or find in manure piles

### Operation
**Feeding:**
- Bury food scraps under bedding
- Add 1/2 - 1 lb per week (per lb worms)
- Rotate burial locations (prevents clumping)

**What to Feed:**
- ✅ Vegetable/fruit scraps (chopped small)
- ✅ Coffee grounds, tea bags
- ✅ Crushed eggshells (grit for worms)
- ✅ Shredded paper (in moderation)
- ❌ Meat, dairy, oils (anaerobic, pests)
- ❌ Citrus (too acidic)
- ❌ Onions/garlic (worms dislike)

**Maintenance:**
- Keep bedding moist (like wrung sponge)
- Temperature: 55-77°F (worms sensitive to heat/cold)
- Harvest every 3-6 months

**Harvesting:**
1. **Migration method:** Push finished compost to one side, add fresh bedding to other. Feed only new side for 2-4 weeks. Worms migrate. Harvest old side.
2. **Light method:** Dump on tarp in sunlight. Worms burrow down. Scrape top layer every 10 min.

**Worm Castings (Output):**
- Dark, crumbly, earthy smell
- **Use:** Top dressing, seed starting mix, compost tea
- **NPK:** ~2-1-1 plus micronutrients
- **Quality:** Superior to regular compost (microbially active)

## Finished Compost Indicators

**Ready When:**
- ✅ Dark brown to black color
- ✅ Crumbly texture (like coffee grounds)
- ✅ Earthy smell (like forest floor)
- ✅ No heat generation
- ✅ Original materials unrecognizable (except woody bits)
- ✅ Cools to ambient temperature

**If Unfinished:**
- Contains recognizable chunks
- Smells sour or ammonia
- Still hot in center
→ **Action:** Keep turning weekly until finished

## Using Compost

**Application Rates:**

| Use | Amount | Method |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Garden beds (new) | 2-4" layer | Till into top 6-8" |
| Garden beds (annual) | 1-2" layer | Top dress, lightly work in |
| Potting mix | 25-30% compost | Mix with soil/perlite/peat |
| Lawn top dress | 1/4 - 1/2" layer | Rake in (spring/fall) |
| Mulch | 2-3" layer | Don't till, just top |
| Compost tea | 1:5 ratio | Brew 24-48h, dilute 1:10 |

**Sifting:** Use 1/2" hardware cloth to separate finished compost from large chunks (return chunks to pile)

## Build Topsoil: The Math

**Natural Soil Formation:** 100-1000 years per inch

**With Composting:**
- Year 1: 2" compost application → 1" topsoil equivalent
- Year 2: 2" compost → 1" more (total 2")
- Year 3: 2" compost → 1" more (total 3")
- **Year 5: 5" rich topsoil vs. 0.05" naturally**

**Scaling:**
- 100 sq ft bed needs 1.5 cubic yards compost for 2" layer
- Family garden (500 sq ft) = 7.5 cubic yards/year
- **Input ratio:** ~3-4 times compost volume needed in raw materials

**Waste Conversion:**
- Average household produces 200-300 lbs organic waste/year
- **Yields:** ~50-75 lbs finished compost
- **Enough for:** 50-100 sq ft garden annual amendment

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Pile too small | Minimum 3×3×3 ft for hot composting |
| All grass clippings (mat, smell) | Layer with browns, no more than 25% grass |
| Too dry (won't decompose) | Moist as wrung sponge |
| Too wet (anaerobic, smells) | Add browns, turn frequently |
| Adding meat/dairy | Vegetable matter only (cold compost) |
| Not turning hot compost | Turn weekly for fast, quality output |
| Using fresh manure on plants | Compost first (6+ months) to kill pathogens |

## Advanced: Compost Tea

**Purpose:** Liquid fertilizer, microbial inoculant

**Recipe (5 gallons):**
1. 2-3 cups finished compost
2. 1 tablespoon unsulfured molasses (feeds microbes)
3. 5 gallons non-chlorinated water
4. **Aerate:** Aquarium pump + air stone (critical)
5. **Brew:** 24-48 hours at 60-80°F
6. **Strain:** Through cheesecloth or burlap
7. **Use:** Within 4 hours (dilute 1:10 for foliar spray)

**⚠️ WARNING:** Without aeration, tea goes anaerobic (harmful). Must actively bubble.

## Scaling to Community Level

**Compost Windrow (Large-Scale):**
- Rows 3-5 ft high, 8-10 ft wide, any length
- Turn with tractor/skid steer (every 3-5 days)
- Processes tons of material
- **Uses:** Municipal yard waste, farm waste, manure

**Inputs:**
- Restaurant food scraps
- Yard waste collection
- Agricultural residues
- Animal bedding/manure

**Output:** 
- 50% volume reduction (1 ton input → 1000 lbs compost)
- Community garden soil amendments
- Revenue: Bagged compost sales
