# Seed Saving - L4 Agriculture

**Priority: CRITICAL** | **Difficulty: Medium** | **Impact: One harvest → infinite food**

## Overview

Seed saving is the foundational skill for permanent food security. One successful harvest can provide seeds for decades if done correctly. This is the difference between temporary survival and civilization restart.

## Seed Types: What Will Breed True?

| Type | Breeds True? | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Open-Pollinated (OP)** | ✅ YES | Naturally pollinated, stable genetics |
| **Heirloom** | ✅ YES | OP varieties >50 years old, proven genetics |
| **Hybrid (F1)** | ❌ NO | Offspring revert to parent traits (unstable) |
| **GMO** | ❌ NO | Patented, may be sterile or unstable |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Only save seeds from OP or heirloom varieties. Hybrid seeds may produce plants with wildly different characteristics or fail entirely.

## Seed Extraction Methods

### Dry Processing (Easy)
**For:** Beans, peas, lettuce, brassicas, flowers, herbs

**Protocol:**
1. Let seed pods/heads dry completely on plant (brown, brittle)
2. Harvest entire seed head/pod before shattering
3. Further dry indoors 1-2 weeks on screens/paper
4. Thresh by rubbing/shaking to release seeds
5. Winnow (pour between containers outdoors - chaff blows away)
6. Final dry 1 week before storage

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Harvesting too early (seeds immature)
- ✓ Wait until pods are brown and rattle when shaken

### Wet Processing (More Involved)
**For:** Tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, squash

**Protocol:**
1. Select fully ripe fruit from healthiest plants
2. Scoop seeds and pulp into jar
3. Add equal water, label with variety
4. Ferment 2-4 days (bubbles form, film on top)
   - **Purpose:** Removes germination inhibitors, kills diseases
5. Add water, viable seeds sink (discard floaters)
6. Rinse seeds thoroughly in fine strainer
7. Dry on non-stick surface (wax paper, screens)
8. Spread thin, stir daily until completely dry (snap when bent)

**Temperature:** 70-75°F during fermentation, avoid >95°F when drying

## Storage Conditions

**Optimal Environment:**
- **Temperature:** 32-41°F (refrigerator ideal, freezer for long-term)
- **Humidity:** <10% (critical - use desiccant packets)
- **Light:** Complete darkness
- **Container:** Airtight (glass jars, mylar bags with oxygen absorbers)

**Storage Life by Crop:**

| Crop | Years (Cool/Dry) | Years (Frozen) |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Beans, peas | 3-4 | 10+ |
| Brassicas (cabbage, broccoli) | 3-5 | 10+ |
| Tomatoes, peppers | 4-5 | 10+ |
| Lettuce | 1-3 | 5-7 |
| Squash, cucumber | 5-6 | 10+ |
| Onions, leeks | 1-2 | 3-5 |
| Corn | 2-3 | 10+ |
| Carrots, beets | 3-4 | 10+ |

**Desiccant Protocol:**
- Add 1-2 silica gel packets per quart jar
- Replace packets when they turn pink/saturated
- DIY: Rice or powdered milk in paper envelope (less effective)

## Viability Testing

### Float Test (Quick, Rough)
1. Place seeds in water
2. Viable seeds sink within 15 minutes
3. Discard floaters
4. **Limitation:** Not 100% accurate, use for sorting only

### Germination Test (Accurate)
1. Count 10-20 seeds, place on damp paper towel
2. Roll up, place in plastic bag (maintain moisture)
3. Keep at 65-75°F
4. Check daily, count sprouted seeds after 7-10 days
5. **Germination Rate:** (Sprouted ÷ Total) × 100
   - >80% = Excellent
   - 60-80% = Good (plant more densely)
   - <60% = Replace stock

**Test annually** for critical crops, every 2-3 years for others.

## Cross-Pollination Prevention

Seeds will cross with same species, producing off-type plants. Isolation required.

| Crop Family | Cross-Pollinates With | Isolation Distance |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Squash/Pumpkin | Same species only* | 1/2 mile or cage |
| Corn | All corn varieties | 1 mile or time isolate |
| Brassicas | All brassicas (broccoli, cabbage, kale) | 1 mile or cage |
| Beets/Chard | Each other | 1 mile |
| Peppers | Other peppers (less likely) | 300-500 ft or cage |
| Tomatoes | Self-pollinating (rarely crosses) | 10-20 ft adequate |

**\*Squash species:** C. pepo (zucchini, acorn), C. maxima (hubbard, buttercup), C. moschata (butternut) - only cross within species.

### Isolation Techniques

**1. Distance Isolation**
- Grow only one variety of cross-pollinating crop
- Or separate by distance above

**2. Time Isolation**
- Plant varieties to flower at different times (2-3 weeks apart)
- Works for small plots

**3. Physical Barriers (Hand Pollination)**
- Cover flowers with bags before opening
- Hand pollinate with small brush
- Re-bag after pollination
- **Best for:** Squash (large flowers, easy), brassicas, corn (bag tassel and ear)

**4. Caging**
- Build screen cages (exclude insects)
- Introduce pollinators manually or hand pollinate
- Alternate varieties in cage

## Heritage Varieties to Prioritize

**Criteria:** Nutrition density, climate hardiness, flavor, disease resistance, storage life

**Top Priorities by Category:**

**Tomatoes:**
- Brandywine (heirloom, excellent flavor)
- San Marzano (paste, canning)
- Cherokee Purple (heat tolerant, disease resistant)

**Beans:**
- Blue Lake (pole bean, heavy producer)
- Kentucky Wonder (reliable, hardy)
- Calypso (beautiful, protein-rich)

**Squash:**
- Waltham Butternut (stores 6+ months)
- Delicata (sweet, short season)
- Long Island Cheese Pumpkin (multipurpose)

**Corn:**
- Bloody Butcher (dent corn, grinding, hardy)
- Painted Mountain (extreme cold tolerance)
- Golden Bantam (sweet, short season)

**Brassicas:**
- Premium Crop Broccoli (heat tolerant)
- Winterbor Kale (cold hardy to -20°F)
- Early Jersey Wakefield Cabbage (reliable)

**Greens:**
- Parris Island Cos Lettuce (heat resistant)
- Bloomsdale Spinach (cold hardy)

**Root Crops:**
- Danvers Half-Long Carrot (stores well)
- Detroit Dark Red Beet (reliable)

## Step-by-Step: First Year Seed Saving

**Spring (Planting):**
1. Choose 2-3 easy crops (beans, peas, tomatoes)
2. Verify seeds are OP or heirloom
3. Plant extras specifically for seed (don't harvest these)

**Summer (Selection):**
1. Mark best plants with flags/stakes
   - First to produce
   - Disease-free
   - Truest to type (shape, color, flavor)
2. Let seed plants mature fully (don't harvest)

**Fall (Harvest):**
1. Collect seeds when completely mature
2. Process (dry or wet method)
3. Dry thoroughly (1-2 weeks minimum)
4. Test germination of small sample

**Storage:**
1. Package in paper envelopes (label variety, date)
2. Place envelopes in jar with desiccant
3. Store in refrigerator
4. Log varieties in notebook

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Saving hybrid seeds | Only OP/heirloom varieties |
| Harvesting immature seeds | Wait for full maturity (brown, dry) |
| Storing damp seeds | Dry until brittle (snap test) |
| Mixed varieties cross-pollinate | Isolate by distance or time |
| No germination testing | Test annually, adjust planting |
| Room temperature storage | Refrigerate for longevity |
| Selecting pretty fruit | Select for health, vigor, productivity |

## Why This Is Critical

**Multiplication Factor:** 
- 1 tomato plant = 100+ seeds = 100 future plants = 10,000 seeds
- 1 bean plant = 200 beans = 200 plants = 40,000 beans
- **One successful harvest = perpetual food supply**

**Timeline to Food Security:**
- Year 1: Grow and save seeds
- Year 2: Plant 10x area from saved seeds
- Year 3: Plant 100x original area
- Year 5: Community seed library, trade network

**Seed saving transforms annual survival into permanent abundance.**

## Safety & Quality

**Avoid Disease Transmission:**
- Never save seeds from diseased plants
- Fermentation (wet processing) kills most pathogens
- Discard entire stock if disease present

**Maintain Genetic Diversity:**
- Save seeds from 5-10 plants minimum (prevents inbreeding)
- Avoid selecting for single trait only
- Rotate selection criteria (vigor, yield, flavor)
