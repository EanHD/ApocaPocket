summary: Save seeds from harvest to plant next year (self-sufficiency). Heirloom varieties (open-pollinated) produce true-to-type seeds. Hybrid seeds do not. Dry seeds thoroughly, store cool and dry. Test
  germination before spring.
warnings:
- Hybrid seeds (F1) do not produce true offspring - save only heirloom/open-pollinated varieties
- Wet seeds mold - dry completely before storage
- Old seeds lose viability - test germination rate before planting
- Some plants cross-pollinate easily (squash) - isolate varieties to maintain purity
steps:
- 'SELECTING PLANTS: Choose healthiest, most productive plants for seed saving. Let fruit fully ripen on plant.'
- 'DRY SEEDS: Tomatoes, peppers - ferment pulp 3 days, rinse, dry. Beans, peas - let pods dry on plant, shell. Squash - scoop seeds, rinse, dry. Lettuce - let bolt (flower), collect seeds from dried seed
  heads.'
- 'STORAGE: Store in paper envelopes or glass jars. Label variety and year. Keep cool (10-15C), dry, dark. Seeds last 2-5 years (varies by species).'
- 'GERMINATION TEST: Before planting season, test 10 seeds on damp paper towel. Count how many sprout. 70 percent+ is good. Low rate = plant extra to compensate.'
- 'HEIRLOOM VARIETIES: Old non-hybrid varieties (passed down generations). Produce consistent seeds. Flavor often better than hybrids but lower yield. Preserve genetic diversity.'

# Seed Saving — Heirloom Varieties & Self-Sufficiency

Save seeds from harvest to plant next year (self-sufficiency). Heirloom varieties (open-pollinated) produce true-to-type seeds. Hybrid seeds do not. Dry seeds thoroughly, store cool and dry. Test germination before spring.
