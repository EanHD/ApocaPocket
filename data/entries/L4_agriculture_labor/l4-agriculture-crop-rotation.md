# Crop Rotation - L4 Agriculture

**Priority: HIGH** | **Difficulty: Medium** | **Impact: Prevent disease, build soil, increase yields**

## Overview

Crop rotation is the practice of growing different crops in sequence on the same land. It breaks pest/disease cycles, balances soil nutrients, improves soil structure, and increases yields without external inputs. This is the difference between depleted, disease-prone soil and regenerative, productive land. Ancient farmers knew this; modern industrial agriculture forgot it. You won't.

## Why Crop Rotation Works

**Problem with Monoculture (Same Crop Every Year):**
- ❌ Pests/diseases build up in soil (host available every season)
- ❌ Depletes specific nutrients (each crop has unique needs)
- ❌ Soil structure degrades (same root patterns)
- ❌ Yields decline (year after year)
- ❌ Requires increasing inputs (fertilizer, pesticides) to maintain production

**Benefits of Rotation:**
- ✅ **Breaks pest/disease cycles** (no host = population crash)
- ✅ **Balances nutrients** (legumes fix nitrogen → heavy feeders use it)
- ✅ **Improves soil structure** (different root types)
- ✅ **Increases organic matter** (varied residues)
- ✅ **Reduces weeds** (different crop competition patterns)
- ✅ **Increases yields** (20-30% average vs monoculture)

**The Principle:** Different crops = different needs, pests, root systems. Rotate = break bad cycles, create good cycles.

## The 4-Year Rotation Plan (Standard)

Divide crops into 4 families. Rotate families through 4 beds/plots over 4 years.

### Family 1: Legumes (Nitrogen-Fixers)

**Crops:** Peas, beans (bush, pole, fava), lentils, clover, vetch

**Why First:**
- Fix atmospheric nitrogen (50-150 lbs N/acre)
- Add organic matter (roots, residues)
- Deep roots break up compaction
- Prepare soil for heavy feeders next year

**Planting:**
- Spring: Peas, fava beans
- Summer: Bush beans, pole beans
- Fall: Cover crop (crimson clover, hairy vetch)

**Harvest/Till:** 
- **Leave roots in soil** (nitrogen in nodules)
- Till in above-ground material before flowering (green manure)
- Or harvest beans/peas, then plant cover crop

### Family 2: Brassicas (Leafy/Cole Crops)

**Crops:** Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, turnips, radish, kohlrabi

**Follow:** Legumes (high nitrogen needs)

**Why Second:**
- Heavy feeders (use nitrogen from previous year's legumes)
- Brassica root exudates differ from legumes (pest/disease break)
- Fast-growing (4-12 weeks) = quick nutrient uptake

**Planting:**
- Spring: Broccoli, cabbage, kale (transplants)
- Fall: Same crops (tolerate frost, taste better after cold)

**Common Pests:** Cabbage worms, aphids, flea beetles
- **Rotation benefit:** No buildup if following legumes

### Family 3: Solanaceae + Cucurbits (Fruiting Crops)

**Crops:** 
- **Solanaceae:** Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes
- **Cucurbits:** Squash, cucumber, melon, pumpkin

**Follow:** Brassicas

**Why Third:**
- Moderate feeders (nitrogen needs met by 2-year buildup)
- Long growing season (utilize accumulated nutrients)
- Different pest/disease profile from brassicas/legumes

**Planting:**
- Spring: Start indoors (tomatoes, peppers), direct seed (squash, cucumber)
- Summer: Long production period (12-20 weeks)

**Common Pests:** 
- Tomato hornworm, squash vine borer, cucumber beetle
- **Rotation benefit:** Can't overwinter without host present

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Never follow nightshades with nightshades (tomatoes → potatoes = disease disaster)

### Family 4: Roots + Alliums

**Crops:**
- **Roots:** Carrots, beets, parsnips, turnips, rutabaga
- **Alliums:** Onions, garlic, leeks, shallots

**Follow:** Solanaceae/Cucurbits

**Why Fourth:**
- Light feeders (don't require high nitrogen)
- Deep taproots (carrots, parsnips) scavenge deep nutrients
- Alliums = natural pest deterrents (antibiotic properties)
- Break disease cycles from year 3

**Planting:**
- Spring: Carrots, beets, onions (sets or transplants)
- Fall: Garlic (overwinters, harvest summer)

**Soil Prep:** Loose, deep soil (root crops need room)

## 4-Year Rotation Example (4 Beds)

| Year | Bed A | Bed B | Bed C | Bed D |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **1** | Legumes | Brassicas | Solanaceae | Roots |
| **2** | Brassicas | Solanaceae | Roots | Legumes |
| **3** | Solanaceae | Roots | Legumes | Brassicas |
| **4** | Roots | Legumes | Brassicas | Solanaceae |
| **5** | Legumes | Brassicas | Solanaceae | Roots |

**Pattern:** Each bed rotates to next family each year (clockwise).

**After Year 4:** Cycle repeats (back to starting pattern).

## Nitrogen Fixing: The Engine of Rotation

**How It Works:**
1. Legume roots host *Rhizobium* bacteria (in nodules)
2. Bacteria convert N₂ (atmospheric nitrogen) → NH₃ (ammonia)
3. Plant uses some nitrogen, stores rest in roots/nodules
4. When legume dies/is tilled in → nitrogen released to soil
5. Next crop (heavy feeder) uses this nitrogen

**Nitrogen Contribution:**

| Legume | N Fixed (lbs/acre) | Equivalent Fertilizer |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Peas | 50-80 | $20-30 value |
| Beans (bush/pole) | 40-60 | $15-25 value |
| Fava beans | 80-100 | $30-40 value |
| Clover (cover crop) | 100-150 | $40-60 value |
| Vetch (cover crop) | 100-200 | $40-80 value |
| Alfalfa (perennial) | 150-250 | $60-100 value |

**Best Practice:**
- Plant legumes after heavy feeders (brassicas, solanaceae)
- Till in legume residue before flowering (maximum nitrogen)
- Or harvest crop, then plant legume cover crop

## Disease & Pest Prevention

**How Rotation Breaks Cycles:**

**Example 1: Tomato Blight**
- **Problem:** *Phytophthora* (late blight) overwinters in soil
- **Solution:** Plant tomatoes in different bed (pathogen dies without host in 2-3 years)

**Example 2: Cabbage Root Maggot**
- **Problem:** Fly larvae overwinter in soil, attack brassica roots
- **Solution:** No brassicas next year = no food = population crash

**Example 3: Squash Vine Borer**
- **Problem:** Larvae pupate in soil, emerge as adults to attack squash
- **Solution:** Squash in different bed = adults emerge where no host = can't reproduce

**Minimum Rotation:** 3 years for most pests/diseases
- Year 1: Crop A in Bed 1
- Year 2: Crop B in Bed 1 (Crop A in Bed 2)
- Year 3: Crop C in Bed 1 (Crop A in Bed 3)
- Year 4: Crop D in Bed 1 (Crop A back to Bed 1 - safe)

**Exceptions (Longer Rotation):**
- **Clubroot (brassicas):** 7-10 years
- **Verticillium wilt:** 5-7 years
- **Nematodes:** 3-5 years

**When Rotation Isn't Enough:**
- Severe infestation: Solarize soil (clear plastic, 4-6 weeks summer heat)
- Add compost (beneficial microbes outcompete pathogens)
- Resistant varieties (genetic resistance to specific diseases)

## Soil Improvement Through Rotation

**Different Roots = Better Soil:**

| Root Type | Crop Examples | Benefit |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Fibrous** (shallow, dense) | Grasses, onions, lettuce | Hold topsoil, prevent erosion |
| **Taproot** (deep, single) | Carrots, parsnips, dandelion | Break compaction, access deep nutrients |
| **Nodulated** (nitrogen-fixing) | Legumes | Add nitrogen, improve fertility |
| **Rhizomatous** (spreading) | Asparagus (perennial) | Stabilize soil, long-term structure |

**Rotation Strategy:**
- Alternate shallow (fibrous) and deep (taproot) roots
- Prevents compaction layer formation (same depth tillage/roots)
- Creates channels for water infiltration

**Organic Matter:**
- Different crops = different residue composition (carbon:nitrogen ratios)
- Variety of residues = diverse soil food web (bacteria, fungi, protozoa)
- More diversity = healthier soil

## Cover Crops: The Rotation Multiplier

**Cover crops** = plants grown not for harvest, but for soil benefit.

**Plant Between Cash Crops:**
- After harvest (fall)
- Before next crop (spring)
- During fallow period

### Cover Crop Types

**Nitrogen-Fixers (Legumes):**
- Crimson clover, hairy vetch, field peas, fava beans
- **When:** After heavy feeders (before planting heavy feeders again)
- **Benefit:** Add 50-150 lbs N/acre

**Carbon Builders (Grasses/Grains):**
- Winter rye, oats, buckwheat, annual ryegrass
- **When:** After any crop
- **Benefit:** Add organic matter, prevent erosion, smother weeds

**Brassicas (Biofumigants):**
- Mustard, radish, turnip
- **When:** After any crop (especially before nightshades)
- **Benefit:** Suppress soil pathogens (release glucosinolates when tilled in)

**Mixes (Best):**
- Combine legume + grass (e.g., vetch + rye)
- **Benefit:** Nitrogen fixing + carbon building

### Cover Crop Protocol

1. **Plant:** Immediately after harvest (don't leave soil bare)
   - Fall: Winter rye, crimson clover, hairy vetch (overwinter)
   - Spring/Summer: Buckwheat, oats (quick-growing)

2. **Grow:** 6-12 weeks (or overwinter)

3. **Terminate:** Before flowering (seeds = weed problem)
   - **Method 1:** Mow/cut, leave as mulch (no-till)
   - **Method 2:** Till in (green manure - nutrients return to soil)
   - **Timing:** 2-4 weeks before planting next crop (allow decomposition)

4. **Plant Cash Crop:** As scheduled in rotation

**Cover Crop Rotation Example:**
- Spring: Plant peas → Harvest July
- Summer: Plant buckwheat cover crop → Terminate September
- Fall: Plant garlic → Harvest July (next year)
- Summer: Plant crimson clover → Overwinter
- Spring: Terminate clover, plant tomatoes

**Effect:** Never bare soil. Always building.

## Green Manure: Maximum Nutrient Cycling

**Green manure** = growing a crop specifically to till in (not harvest).

**Best Green Manures:**

| Crop | C:N Ratio | Decomposition Speed | N Contribution |
|------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Vetch** | 10:1 | Fast (2-3 weeks) | Very high |
| **Clover** | 12:1 | Fast | High |
| **Fava beans** | 15:1 | Medium (3-4 weeks) | High |
| **Buckwheat** | 20:1 | Fast (2 weeks) | Low (biomass high) |
| **Rye** | 40:1 | Slow (4-6 weeks) | Low (carbon high) |

**Protocol:**
1. Plant cover crop (spring or fall)
2. Let grow to flowering stage (maximum biomass)
3. **Mow/chop** (smaller pieces = faster decomposition)
4. **Till in** (incorporate into top 4-6")
5. **Wait:** 2-4 weeks (allow decomposition)
6. Plant next crop

**Nitrogen Release:**
- High N crops (vetch, clover): Release 50-80% N in 2-4 weeks
- Available for next crop (heavy feeder)

**When to Use:**
- Soil is depleted (low organic matter)
- Before planting heavy feeders (brassicas, corn, tomatoes)
- Building new beds (transition from lawn/weeds)

## Companion Planting Within Rotation

**Companion planting** = growing beneficial combinations together in same bed.

**Classic Examples:**

**Three Sisters (Native American):**
- **Corn** (tall, nitrogen-depleting)
- **Beans** (climb corn, fix nitrogen)
- **Squash** (ground cover, suppress weeds)
- **Effect:** Mutually beneficial, high yield

**Pest Deterrents:**
- **Marigolds** with tomatoes (repel aphids, whiteflies)
- **Basil** with tomatoes (repel hornworms, improve flavor)
- **Nasturtium** (trap crop for aphids - draw away from main crop)
- **Garlic/Onions** (general pest deterrent)

**Nutrient Sharing:**
- **Lettuce** under tomatoes (shade-tolerant, doesn't compete)
- **Radishes** with carrots (radishes break soil, carrots grow deep)

**Integration with Rotation:**
- Companions change with crop family rotation
- Example: Bed A (Year 1 - Legumes) → Plant beans + corn + squash
- Year 2 (Brassicas) → Plant cabbage + onions + marigolds
- **Diversity within diversity.**

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Same crop in same bed every year | 4-year minimum rotation |
| Tomatoes → Potatoes (same family) | Separate nightshades by 3+ years |
| No cover crops (bare soil) | Cover crop between cash crops |
| Tilling in mature cover crop (woody) | Terminate before flowering (tender) |
| Ignoring weed seeds in rotation | Pull weeds before seeding (break weed cycles too) |
| No records (forget what grew where) | Keep garden journal (map + dates) |
| Rotating crops but not families | Rotate FAMILIES, not individual crops |

## Advanced: Integrating Perennials

**Challenge:** Rotation requires moving crops. Perennials stay put.

**Solutions:**

1. **Dedicate beds to perennials:**
   - Asparagus, rhubarb, artichoke, perennial herbs
   - Don't include in rotation (permanent)

2. **Edge planting:**
   - Place perennials at garden edges (don't disrupt rotation)

3. **Food forest integration:**
   - Perennials in food forest (see [l4-agriculture-food-forests.md])
   - Annuals in rotation beds (separate systems)

4. **Alley cropping:**
   - Rows of perennials (fruit trees, berries)
   - Annual crops in alleys between rows
   - Rotate annuals, perennials stay

## Scaling: From Backyard to Field

**Backyard (4 beds, 100 sq ft each):**
- Simple 4-year rotation (1 family per bed)
- Track with garden journal

**Small Farm (1 acre, 10 plots):**
- 4-year rotation + 6 plots in cover crops (rotate which plots are fallow)
- Or extend to 10-year rotation (more complex but allows more diversity)

**Commercial (10+ acres):**
- Map fields, assign rotation zones
- GPS/software tracking (what grew where, when)
- Equipment limitations (can't move greenhouses) - dedicate zones

**Principle stays same:** Don't grow same family in same place consecutively. Scale up by adding beds/fields.

## Why Crop Rotation is Critical

**Yield Increases:**
- 20-30% higher yields (average, vs monoculture)
- Without added fertilizer or pesticides

**Cost Savings:**
- $50-100/acre saved (fertilizer not needed after legumes)
- $20-50/acre saved (fewer pesticides - pest cycles broken)

**Soil Health:**
- Organic matter increases 0.5-1% per year (with cover crops)
- Better water retention (1% OM = 20,000 gal water/acre)
- Improved structure (easier tillage, root penetration)

**Resilience:**
- Disease-resistant (pathogen populations low)
- Weather-resistant (healthy soil = drought tolerance)
- Sustainable (indefinite production without external inputs)

**The Compound Effect:**
- Year 1: Small improvement
- Year 5: Noticeable difference (soil darker, yields higher, fewer pests)
- Year 10: Regenerative system (soil improving itself, inputs minimal)

**This is how civilizations fed themselves for 10,000 years. It works.**
