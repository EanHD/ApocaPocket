summary: Goats are hardy, versatile livestock. Provide milk (2-3 quarts per day), meat, fiber (Angora goats). Eat browse (shrubs, weeds) that other animals reject. Smaller and easier than cows. 1-2 goats
  can support a family.
warnings:
- Goats escape easily - need very secure fencing
- Male goats (bucks) smell terrible during breeding season
- Goats are herd animals - need at least 2 (single goat is stressed)
- Raw goat milk can carry disease - pasteurize or boil
steps:
- 'HOUSING: Simple shelter from weather. 15-20 sq ft per goat. Raised sleeping platform (goats prefer elevation).'
- 'FEEDING: Goats are browsers (prefer leaves, brush, weeds). Supplement with hay, grains if browse is limited. Always provide fresh water and mineral block.'
- 'MILKING: Dairy breeds (Nigerian Dwarf, Nubian) produce 2-3 quarts daily. Milk twice daily (morning and evening). Hand milking technique similar to cows.'
- 'BREEDING: Breed annually (fall). 5-month gestation. Kids (babies) born spring. Goats can breed year 1, productive 5-10 years.'
- 'MEAT: Butcher kids at 6-12 months or old does. Chevon (goat meat) similar to lamb.'
