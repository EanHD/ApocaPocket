summary:
- "Goats are hardy, versatile livestock. Dairy breeds provide 2-4L milk daily (Nigerian Dwarf 1.5-2.5L, Nubian 3-4L, Alpine 3.5-5L). Meat goats reach 35-50kg market weight in 6-8 months. Adult does weigh 40-80kg, bucks 60-100kg. Eat browse (shrubs, weeds, leaves) that other animals reject—can clear overgrown land. Smaller and easier than cows. 2-3 goats (1 milking, 1 dry, 1 kid) support family nutrition. Gestation 145-155 days. Lifespan 12-18 years, productive 8-12 years. warnings:"
- Goats are EXPERT ESCAPE ARTISTS—can jump 1.5m, squeeze through 15cm gaps, climb 45° slopes, open simple latches. Require fence minimum 1.2m height (1.5m for bucks), buried 20cm deep or extended outward 30cm (prevent digging), mesh spacing max 10cm (kids) or 15cm (adults). Woven wire better than barbed (goats get tangled). Electric fence (5-7 strands, 2500-3000V) works well
- Male goats (bucks) smell TERRIBLE during breeding season (Sep-Feb). Musk glands produce pheromones—odor detectable 50+ meters downwind. Bucks spray urine on face/beard (attraction behavior). Keep bucks downwind of house, 30+ meters from milking area (milk absorbs odors). Consider buck service rather than keeping buck (rent for breeding visits)
- "Goats are herd animals (social, prey species instinct). MINIMUM 2 goats (single goat is stressed, vocalizes constantly, escape attempts increase). 3-5 goats is ideal herd. Goats bond with other species if no goats available (sheep, donkeys, cows—less ideal but acceptable). Social isolation causes: reduced milk production (15-30%), weight loss, aggression, depression"
- Raw goat milk can carry:
- "Brucellosis (Brucella melitensis—fever, joint pain), Tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii). ALWAYS pasteurize: heat to 63°C for 30 minutes (LTLT method) or 72°C for 15 seconds (HTST method), or boil for 2 minutes. Pasteurized milk lasts 7-10 days refrigerated (4°C)"
- Goats require hoof trimming every 6-12 weeks (hooves grow 6-8mm per month, wear depends on terrain). Overgrown hooves cause lameness, joint damage, infection. Use hoof trimming shears, trim to natural angle (45-50°), cut back overgrowth until trimming hoof (pink tissue) barely visible
- Goats are susceptible to internal parasites (Haemonchus contortus barber pole worm, coccidia). Symptoms: "anemia (pale gums, eyelids), diarrhea, weight loss, bottle jaw (swelling under chin). CONTROL: Rotational grazing (move to fresh pasture every 3-5 days), raised feeding (trough not ground—prevents fecal contamination), fecal egg count monitoring (microscope exam), targeted deworming (only treat affected animals, preserves deworm effectiveness). FAMACHA scoring (eyelid color chart) indicates anemia level steps:"
- 'HOUSING & SPACE REQUIREMENTS: "SHELTER: Simple three-sided shed (open to south in Northern Hemisphere for sunlight/ventilation). Dimensions: 1.2-1.5m² floor space per goat MINIMUM (1.8-2.5m² preferred for comfort). Height: 2m minimum (goats rear up). FLOOR: Dirt, gravel, or wood platforms (avoid concrete—too hard, causes joint problems). BEDDING: Straw or wood shavings 10-15cm deep, change weekly or add layers (deep litter method—builds to 30cm over months, generates heat through decomposition). SLEEPING PLATFORM: Goats instinctively seek high ground (predator avoidance). Build platforms 40-60cm high, 1m² per 2 goats. Use sturdy wood (2×4 or 2×6 lumber). Goats will fight for highest spot. VENTILATION: Critical—poor ventilation causes pneumonia. Provide vents near roof (stale air/ammonia rises). Never seal building completely. FENCING: 1.2-1.5m height woven wire (10-15cm openings), posts every 2.5-3m. Bury fence 20cm or extend outward 30cm. Electric fence works: 5-7 strands at heights 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 110cm, voltage 2500-3000V, check weekly for vegetation shorts. PASTURE: 150-400m² per goat depending on forage quality (less space = more supplemental feed needed). Rotate pastures every 3-5 days to prevent parasite buildup."
- 'FEEDING & NUTRITION: "BROWSE (preferred natural diet): Goats eat 2-4% of body weight daily (50kg goat eats 1-2kg dry matter). BROWSE INCLUDES: Leaves, twigs, bark, shrubs, brambles, weeds, vines. Goats prefer variety—rotate areas. TOXIC PLANTS TO AVOID: Rhododendron, azalea, mountain laurel, yew, cherry leaves (wilted—contain cyanide), black locust. HAY SUPPLEMENT (when browse insufficient): Grass/legume mix best. Feed 1-2kg per day per goat. Alfalfa is excellent (high protein 15-20%, calcium-rich) but expensive. Grass hay adequate (protein 8-12%). Feed from raised rack (prevents waste and fecal contamination—goats won''t eat soiled hay). GRAIN SUPPLEMENT (for milking does): 0.5-1kg per day per 3L milk produced. Grain mix: oats, barley, corn (avoid too much corn—causes acidosis). Gradual introduction essential—sudden grain feeding causes life-threatening acidosis (rumen pH drops below 5.5, goat can die in 24h). MINERALS: Free-choice loose minerals (not block—goats don''t lick enough). Goat-specific minerals (higher copper than sheep minerals—sheep minerals cause copper deficiency in goats). Provide 10-15g per goat per day. WATER: 3-10L per day per goat depending on temperature, lactation, diet. Milking does drink 8-12L daily. Change daily (goats refuse stale water). Heated in winter (goats won''t drink ice water, milk production drops 30-50%). SALT: Free-choice salt block or loose salt. Goats need 5-10g daily. FEEDING SCHEDULE: Browse/hay available continuously (goats are continuous feeders, small meals throughout day). Grain 2× daily (morning and evening), measured portions."
- 'MILKING TECHNIQUE & SCHEDULE: "DAIRY BREEDS: Nigerian Dwarf (small, 40-60kg, milk 1.5-2.5L/day, high butterfat 6-10%), Nubian (large, 60-80kg, milk 3-4L/day, butterfat 4-5%, distinctive long ears), Alpine (60-70kg, milk 3.5-5L/day, butterfat 3-4%, excellent temperament), LaMancha (no visible ears, 60-75kg, milk 3-4L/day). LACTATION CYCLE: Does must give birth (freshen) to produce milk. Lactation lasts 8-10 months (extended lactation possible 12-18 months with daily milking). Then \"dry period\" 2-3 months before next kidding. MILKING SCHEDULE: 2× daily (12 hours apart), morning and evening. Consistency critical—same times daily. 1× daily possible but reduces milk yield 30-40%. HAND MILKING TECHNIQUE: (1) SETUP: Milking stand with head gate (restrains goat, keeps still). Height 40-50cm. (2) CLEAN: Wash udder with warm water + mild soap. Dry with clean towel. Pre-dip teats in iodine solution (prevents mastitis). (3) STRIP: Squeeze first 2-3 squirts from each teat onto ground (removes bacteria in teat canal, check for mastitis—clumps, blood, watery appearance). (4) MILKING: Trap milk in teat (close fist at top trapping milk below), squeeze progressively down teat (thumb and forefinger, then other fingers in sequence—pushes milk out). Rhythm: 60-90 squeezes per minute. Practice develops speed. (5) Milk until udder soft and empty (5-10 minutes per goat). Leaving milk causes reduced production and mastitis risk. (6) POST-DIP: Dip each teat in iodine solution after milking (seals teat canal, prevents bacteria entry). (7) STRAIN: Pour milk through stainless steel strainer with filter (removes hair, debris). (8) COOL: Refrigerate immediately to <4°C within 30 minutes (slows bacterial growth). YIELD: First freshening (year 1): 1.5-2.5L/day. Mature doe (years 3-5): 3-5L/day depending on breed. PEAK LACTATION: Weeks 4-12 after kidding. Then slowly declines. MASTITIS (udder infection): Hard, hot, swollen udder. Clumpy milk. Treat immediately: hot compresses, hand milk frequently (remove infection), antibiotics if severe. Prevention: Clean milking, post-dip, dry period before kidding."
- 'BREEDING & REPRODUCTION: "BREEDING SEASON: Goats are seasonally polyestrous (cycle Sep-Feb in Northern Hemisphere, triggered by decreasing daylight <12h). Does cycle every 18-21 days (heat lasts 12-48h). SIGNS OF HEAT: Wagging tail, frequent urination, mounting other goats, swollen vulva, clear discharge, vocalization, decreased appetite. BREEDING: Natural service (buck with does) or hand breeding (controlled mating). Buck can breed 20-40 does per season. BREEDING AGE: Does at 7-9 months (Nigerian Dwarf) or 8-12 months (larger breeds) and 30-35kg minimum weight (too young = stunted growth, birthing complications). Bucks at 7-10 months. GESTATION: 145-155 days (average 150 days, exactly 5 months). PREGNANCY DETECTION: Ultrasound at 30+ days (reliable), blood test at 30+ days, abdominal palpation at 90+ days (feel kids moving). KIDDING (BIRTH): Usually unassisted. SIGNS OF LABOR: Restless, pawing ground, tail up, discharge, isolation from herd. STAGES: (1) Early labor: 12-24h, cervix dilates. (2) Active labor: 30-60min, kid appears (normal presentation: front feet and nose). (3) Delivery: 15-30min per kid. Multiple births common (twins 50-70% of births, triplets 25%, singles 15-20%, quads 5%). ASSISTANCE NEEDED IF: No progress after 30min pushing, kid malpresentation (backward, head back, leg back), doe exhaustion. CALL VET or experienced farmer. AFTERCARE: Kid stands and nurses within 1-2 hours (critical—colostrum contains antibodies). Dip navel in 7% iodine (prevents infection). Ensure placenta passed within 12 hours (retained placenta causes infection). BOTTLE FEEDING: If raising kids separately (to keep all milk for human use): Colostrum first 3 days (120-180ml per feeding, 4× daily), then goat milk or replacer (250-500ml per feeding, 4× daily week 1-2, 3× daily weeks 3-6, 2× daily weeks 7-12). Wean at 8-12 weeks when eating solid food reliably. DAM-RAISED (kids nurse from mother): Easier, better kid health, but human doesn''t get milk. Wean at 12-16 weeks."
- 'MEAT PRODUCTION: "MEAT BREEDS: Boer (South African, 60-90kg mature weight, fast growth 200-400g/day), Kiko (New Zealand, hardy, 50-70kg), Spanish (lean, 40-60kg). Dairy breeds also used for meat (males, culled females). GROWTH RATES: Kids weigh 3-5kg at birth. Reach market weight 35-50kg at 6-8 months (depending on breed and feed). Meat goat kids gain 100-200g per day on good feed. MARKET WEIGHTS: 35-50kg live weight (dressing percentage 45-50% = 16-25kg carcass weight). BUTCHERING: Best at 6-12 months (tender meat). Method similar to deer/sheep. CHEVON (goat meat): Lean (fat content 2-4% vs beef 10-20%), protein 20-25%, iron-rich. Taste similar to lamb but slightly sweeter. COOKING: Young goat (kid) is tender (roast, grill, chops). Old goat is tough (slow cook, stew, curry, grind for sausage). CUTS: Leg (roast), shoulder (stew), ribs (grill), loin (chops—most tender), neck (stew), ground meat. YIELD: 50kg live goat produces approximately 22-25kg carcass, 16-18kg meat (after bone/fat trim)."
- 'FIBER GOATS (specialized): "ANGORA: Produce mohair fiber (shear 2× per year, 3-5kg per shearing). Fiber length 10-15cm per 6 months. Mohair is lustrous, strong, dye-receptive (excellent for textiles). Angoras are delicate (require shelter, susceptible to cold stress after shearing). CASHMERE: Undercoat of many goat breeds (harvest by combing in spring when shedding). Yield 100-300g per goat per year. Ultra-fine fiber (diameter 15-19 microns vs mohair 25-45 microns). Very valuable but labor-intensive. FIBER PROCESSING: Shear or comb, wash (remove lanolin/dirt), card (align fibers), spin into yarn."
- 'HEALTH MANAGEMENT: "VACCINATION: CDT (Clostridium perfringens types C & D + Tetanus) annually. Kids at 6-8 weeks, booster 3-4 weeks later, then annual boosters. Prevents enterotoxemia (\"overeating disease\") and tetanus. DEWORMING: Based on FAMACHA score (eyelid color indicates anemia from worms) and fecal egg counts. Dewormers: fenbendazole, ivermectin, moxidectin (rotate classes to prevent resistance). HOOF CARE: Trim every 6-12 weeks. COMMON DISEASES: Mastitis (udder infection), pneumonia (respiratory infection from cold/damp), enterotoxemia (sudden death from grain overload), bloat (excess gas in rumen), acidosis (rumen pH too low), listeriosis (brain infection, \"circling disease\"), caseous lymphadenitis (abscesses), sore mouth (contagious ecthyma, viral lesions). SIGNS OF ILLNESS: Isolation from herd, lack of appetite, dull eyes, abnormal posture (hunched, head down), labored breathing, diarrhea, abnormal temperature (normal: 38.5-40°C rectal). ACT QUICKLY—goats decline rapidly when ill. RECORD KEEPING: Track breeding dates, kidding dates, weights, milk production, deworm ing dates, illness/treatment (essential for management and productivity analysis)."
