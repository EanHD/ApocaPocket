summary: Beyond basic beekeeping - managing hive health, preventing swarming, capturing wild swarms, extracting honey without equipment. Bees provide honey, wax, pollination. One hive produces 30-60 lbs
  honey per year. Requires weekly inspections during active season.
warnings:
- Bee stings can be fatal to allergic individuals - know your allergy status
- Aggressive hives (Africanized bees in some regions) are dangerous
- Improper hive management leads to swarms (bees leave) or hive death
steps:
- 'HIVE INSPECTIONS: Weekly during spring/summer. Check: (1) Queen present (eggs, larvae visible). (2) Adequate food (honey, pollen stores). (3) Pests (varroa mites, wax moths, small hive beetles). (4)
  Space (add boxes if crowded - prevents swarming).'
- 'SWARM PREVENTION: Bees swarm when hive is crowded (colony splits, half leaves with old queen). PREVENT: Add boxes for space, split hive manually (artificial swarm), remove queen cells (where new queens
  develop).'
- 'CAPTURING SWARMS: Wild swarms cluster on branch (20,000 bees in ball). CAPTURE: (1) Shake or brush swarm into box. (2) Leave box near swarm site until evening (stragglers enter). (3) Close box, move
  to hive location. (4) Transfer into hive boxes. Free bees, fully functional colony.'
- 'HONEY HARVEST: Late summer (after nectar flow ends). (1) Remove frames with capped honey. (2) Brush off bees. (3) Cut off wax caps (with knife). (4) Extract honey (centrifuge spinner or crush-and-strain
  method). (5) Strain, bottle. (6) Leave 60+ lbs honey for bees (winter food).'
- 'WINTER MANAGEMENT: Bees cluster for warmth (do not open hive in cold). Reduce hive entrance (keeps mice out). Check weight (lift hive - should feel heavy. Light = feed sugar syrup). Insulate if extreme
  cold.'
