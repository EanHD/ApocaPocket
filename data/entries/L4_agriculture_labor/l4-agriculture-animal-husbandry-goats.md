# Animal Husbandry: Goats - L4 Agriculture

**Priority: HIGH** | **Difficulty: Medium** | **Impact: Milk, meat, leather, brush clearing**

## Overview

Goats are the versatile homestead animal: milk, meat, fiber, leather, and brush control. They thrive on marginal land, require less space than cows, and produce milk nearly year-round. A small herd (3-5 goats) can provide dairy for a family while clearing overgrown land and producing manure for the garden. This is mid-level livestock - more complex than chickens, but far more productive.

## Why Goats?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Small (1/10 size of cow, easier handling)
- ✅ Efficient browsers (eat brush, weeds, brambles)
- ✅ Milk production (1-2 quarts/day, 10 months/year)
- ✅ Fast reproduction (5 months gestation, kids at 7-9 months)
- ✅ Thrive on marginal land (rocky, hilly, brushy)
- ✅ Multiple products (milk, meat, leather, fiber)
- ✅ Parasite resistant (compared to sheep)
- ✅ Social, intelligent, entertaining

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Escape artists (need strong fencing)
- ❌ Herd animals (need 2+ goats minimum)
- ❌ Twice-daily milking (tie you down)
- ❌ Browsers (will destroy trees, gardens if not managed)
- ❌ Can be noisy (bleating)
- ❌ Buck odor (strong, musky - keep separate)

**Comparison:**
- Goats vs Cows: 1/10 feed, 1/4 milk, 1/10 space, easier handling
- Goats vs Sheep: Better browsers, less wool, higher milk production, more personable

## Breeds: Choose Your Purpose

### Dairy Breeds (Milk Production)

| Breed | Milk/Day | Fat % | Size | Temperament | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| **Saanen** | 1-2 gal | 3-4% | Large (150 lbs) | Calm | Highest producer, white, heat-sensitive |
| **Nubian** | 1-1.5 gal | 4-5% | Large (135 lbs) | Vocal | High butterfat, long ears, colorful |
| **Alpine** | 1-1.5 gal | 3.5% | Medium (135 lbs) | Hardy | Adaptable, varied colors |
| **LaMancha** | 1-1.5 gal | 4% | Medium (130 lbs) | Calm | Tiny ears, even tempered, hardy |
| **Nigerian Dwarf** | 1-2 qts | 6-10% | Small (75 lbs) | Friendly | Mini, very rich milk, backyard-friendly |

**Choose Dairy If:** Primary goal is milk (fresh, cheese, soap)

### Meat Breeds

| Breed | Mature Weight | Growth Rate | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Boer** | 200-340 lbs | Fast | Purpose-bred for meat, muscular |
| **Kiko** | 180-250 lbs | Fast | Hardy, parasite-resistant, minimal care |
| **Spanish** | 150-250 lbs | Medium | Adaptable, brush clearing, hardy |

**Choose Meat If:** Primary goal is meat production (less milking labor)

### Fiber Breeds

| Breed | Fiber Type | Yield/Year | Notes |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Angora** | Mohair | 8-16 lbs | Requires shearing 2x/year |
| **Cashmere** | Cashmere | 4-8 oz | Luxurious, cold climates |

**Choose Fiber If:** Textile production (niche market, value-added)

**Dual-Purpose:** Nubian, Alpine (good milk + decent meat)

## Housing Requirements

### Shelter

**Size:** 15 sq ft per goat (indoor shelter)
- 2 goats = 30 sq ft (6×5 ft)
- 5 goats = 75 sq ft (10×8 ft)

**Features:**
1. **Three-sided structure** (minimum)
   - Protects from wind, rain, snow
   - Open side facing away from prevailing winds
   - Full barn not required (goats are hardy)

2. **Dry bedding:** Straw, wood shavings (deep litter method)
   - Change/add weekly (keep dry)
   - Remove completely 1-2x/year

3. **Elevated sleeping platforms** (optional but preferred)
   - Goats like to be off ground
   - 2-4 ft high, sturdy (goats jump)

4. **Ventilation:** Good airflow (prevent respiratory disease)
   - No drafts at goat level

5. **Separate kidding pen** (10×10 ft)
   - Quiet, clean, warm (for birthing)

### Fencing (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ Goats are escape artists. Fence must be goat-proof or you'll lose them.**

**Options (ranked):**

1. **Woven wire (best):**
   - 4-5 ft high (goats jump)
   - Small openings (goats squeeze through)
   - Buried 6" or apron (prevent digging under)
   - Electric wire on top (prevent jumping/climbing)

2. **Electric fence (effective if trained):**
   - 5-6 strands, 8-12" spacing
   - Lowest wire 6" from ground
   - Train goats young (they learn to respect it)
   - **Requires maintenance** (weeds short, charger working)

3. **Chain link (expensive but permanent):**
   - 5-6 ft high
   - Very secure

4. **Cattle panels (temporary/moveable):**
   - 4×16 ft panels, 4" openings
   - Sturdy, good for rotational grazing
   - Zip-tie to T-posts

**❌ DON'T USE:**
- Barbed wire (injury risk, goats tangle)
- Chicken wire (goats break through easily)

**Gates:** Secure latches (goats learn to open simple hooks). Use carabiners or chains.

### Outdoor Space

**Pasture:** 200-250 sq ft per goat minimum (more is better)
- 2 goats = 500 sq ft (25×20 ft)
- 5 goats = 1250 sq ft (35×35 ft)

**Preference:** Brushy, hilly terrain (goats browse, don't graze like cows)

**Rotational Grazing:** Move goats every 1-2 weeks (prevents parasites, improves land)

## Feeding

### Browse (Preferred)

Goats are **browsers** (eat leaves, twigs, shrubs) not **grazers** (grass).

**Goats Love:**
- Brush, brambles, briars
- Small tree branches (prune from below)
- Weeds (thistle, burdock, poison ivy - yes, they're immune!)
- Leaves (all types)
- Bark (strip trees if allowed)

**⚠️ Protect trees:** Fence off young trees (goats kill them by stripping bark)

### Hay

**Type:** Mixed grass/legume hay (alfalfa, clover, timothy)
- **Dairy goats:** Higher quality (alfalfa for calcium, protein)
- **Meat goats:** Grass hay sufficient

**Amount:** 2-4 lbs/day per goat (average 100 lbs)
- More in winter (no browse)
- Less if good pasture available

**Storage:** Dry, off ground (hay molds easily)

### Grain (Supplement)

**When Needed:**
- Lactating does (milk production - energy intensive)
- Growing kids (rapid growth)
- Pregnant does (last 2 months)
- Bucks during breeding season

**Type:** Goat-specific feed (or sweet feed)
- 16-18% protein for dairy
- 14-16% protein for meat/maintenance

**Amount:** 1/2 - 1 lb per 100 lbs body weight (when milking)
- Feed on milk stand (routine, containment)
- **Don't overfeed:** Obesity, urinary stones (bucks), bloat

**⚠️ WARNING:** Grain for sheep contains copper blockers (TOXIC to goats). Use goat-specific feed only.

### Minerals & Supplements

**Essential:**
- **Loose minerals (free-choice):** Goat-specific (higher copper than sheep/cattle)
- **Salt:** Loose or block
- **Baking soda (free-choice):** Prevents bloat, balances rumen pH

**Trace minerals:** Selenium, copper (deficiencies common)
- Provide as loose minerals or injectable (vet guidance)

### Water

**Critical:** Fresh, clean water at all times
- 2-4 gallons/day per goat (more if lactating, hot weather)
- Goats are picky (won't drink dirty water)
- Heated waterers in winter (prevents freezing)

## Milk Production

### Lactation Cycle

1. **Breeding:** Doe bred in fall (Sept-Dec)
2. **Gestation:** 5 months (145-155 days)
3. **Kidding:** Spring (Feb-May)
4. **Lactation:** 10-12 months (begins after kidding)
   - **Peak:** 6-8 weeks after kidding (1.5-2 gal/day)
   - **Decline:** Gradually decreases over 10 months
5. **Dry period:** 2 months before next kidding (rest udder)

**To Maintain Milk:**
- Milk 2x daily (12 hours apart) - consistency critical
- Breed annually (or continue milking without breeding - possible but decreases)

### Milk Production by Stage

| Stage | Weeks After Kidding | Milk/Day (Average Doe) |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Early lactation | 0-2 | 1/2 - 1 quart |
| Peak | 6-8 | 1-2 quarts |
| Mid lactation | 3-6 months | 1-1.5 quarts |
| Late lactation | 7-10 months | 1/2 - 1 quart |
| Dry period | 2 months before kidding | 0 (not milking) |

**Factors:**
- Breed (dairy breeds produce more)
- Individual genetics (select good milkers)
- Nutrition (grain, quality hay)
- Frequency (2x daily > 1x daily)
- Age (peak production 3-7 years old)

### Milking Technique

**Setup:**
1. **Milk stand:** Elevated platform with head stanchion
   - Goat steps up, head secured (eats grain during milking)
2. **Clean udder:** Warm water + cloth or udder wipes
3. **Strip first squirts:** Into separate container (check for mastitis)

**Hand Milking:**
1. Wrap thumb + forefinger around top of teat (trap milk)
2. Squeeze downward with remaining fingers (like wringing)
3. Release, allow teat to refill
4. Alternate teats rhythmically
5. **Duration:** 5-10 minutes per goat

**Machine Milking:**
- Pulsating vacuum (mimics kid suckling)
- Faster, easier on hands
- **Cost:** $200-2000 (depending on system)

**Yield:** 1-2 quarts per milking (2-4 quarts/day total)

### Milk Handling

**Immediately After Milking:**
1. **Strain:** Through milk filter or cheesecloth (remove hair, debris)
2. **Chill rapidly:** Ice bath or refrigerator (within 30 minutes)
   - Prevents "goaty" flavor (bacteria growth)
3. **Store:** Glass jars, refrigerate (7-10 days fresh)

**Taste:**
- Fresh goat milk = mild, slightly sweet (properly handled)
- "Goaty" flavor = bacteria growth (poor cooling) or buck near does

**Uses:**
- Drinking (fresh, easier to digest than cow milk)
- Cheese (chevre, feta, hard cheese)
- Yogurt, kefir
- Soap (high fat content, luxurious)
- Feed for other animals (pigs, chickens, calves)

## Breeding

### Timing

**Breeding Season:** Fall (Sept-Dec)
- Goats are seasonal breeders (shorter days trigger estrus)
- Does in heat every 18-21 days (lasts 12-48 hours)

**Signs of Heat:**
- Tail wagging, bleating, mounting other does
- Swollen/pink vulva, discharge
- Decreased appetite, restlessness

### Buck Management

**Options:**
1. **Own a buck:**
   - **Pros:** Immediate breeding, genetic control
   - **Cons:** Smell (STRONG), separate housing, aggressive
   
2. **Rent/borrow a buck:**
   - Take doe to buck's location for 24-48 hours
   
3. **Artificial insemination (AI):**
   - Access to superior genetics
   - Requires training or vet

**Buck-to-Doe Ratio:** 1 buck can breed 20-30 does (in season)

**⚠️ Buck Odor:** Bucks urinate on their beards and front legs during rut (breeding season). Smell is INTENSE. Keep downwind and separate from milk does (flavor taints milk).

### Kidding (Birth)

**Gestation:** 145-155 days (average 150 days = 5 months)

**Signs of Labor:**
- Udder fills (may start weeks before)
- Ligaments soften (beside tail head)
- Nesting behavior, pawing ground
- Mucus discharge
- Contractions visible

**Labor Stages:**
1. **Stage 1 (2-12 hours):** Restless, contractions (not visible)
2. **Stage 2 (30 min - 2 hours):** Active labor, kid(s) born
   - Normal presentation: Front hooves + nose (diving position)
   - **Call vet if:** Breech, stuck, no progress after 30 min hard labor
3. **Stage 3 (within 1 hour):** Placenta passes

**Newborn Care:**
1. **Clear airway:** Wipe mucus from nose/mouth (doe usually does this)
2. **Dip navel:** Iodine (prevent infection)
3. **First milk (colostrum):** Within 1 hour (critical for immunity)
   - If kid doesn't nurse, bottle-feed colostrum (2-4 oz)
4. **Monitor:** Kid standing/nursing within 2 hours

**Kids Per Birth:** Usually 1-3 (twins most common)

### Raising Kids

**Dam-Raised (Mother Raises):**
- **Pros:** No bottle feeding, natural, stronger immunity
- **Cons:** Less milk for you, kids less friendly

**Bottle-Raised (Remove at Birth):**
- **Pros:** All milk for you, kids imprint on humans (friendly)
- **Cons:** Labor-intensive (bottle 3-4x/day for 8-12 weeks)

**Bottle Schedule:**
- Week 1-2: 4-6 oz, 4x/day
- Week 3-8: 8-12 oz, 3x/day
- Week 8-12: 12-16 oz, 2x/day, introduce hay/grain
- Week 12: Wean (gradually reduce bottles)

**Disbudding (Horn Removal):**
- Age: 3-10 days old
- Method: Hot iron (kills horn buds)
- **Why:** Safety (horns injure other goats, get stuck in fences)
- **Alternatives:** Breeding polled (naturally hornless) goats

## Health & Common Issues

### Preventive Care

**Hoof Trimming:** Every 6-8 weeks
- Overgrown hooves = lameness, foot rot
- Use hoof trimmers (like pruning shears)
- Trim to match angle of pastern (just above hoof)

**Deworming:** 
- **Parasites:** Goats' biggest health issue (barber pole worm, coccidia)
- **Prevention:** Rotational grazing, avoid wet/muddy areas, check fecal samples
- **Treatment:** Ivermectin, fenbendazole (rotate dewormers, prevent resistance)
- **Frequency:** 2-4x/year (or as needed based on FAMACHA score)

**FAMACHA:** Eye color check (anemia indicator)
- Red/pink = healthy
- Pale pink/white = anemic (heavy parasite load - deworm)

**CDT Vaccine:** Clostridium perfringens (overeating disease) + Tetanus
- Annual booster
- Pregnant does: 1 month before kidding (passes immunity to kids)
- Kids: Vaccinate at 8 weeks, booster at 12 weeks

### Common Problems

| Issue | Symptoms | Cause | Treatment |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Bloat** | Distended left side, discomfort | Overeating grain/lush forage (gas buildup) | Baking soda, walk goat, tube/trochar (vet) |
| **Mastitis** | Hot, swollen udder, clots in milk | Bacterial infection | Antibiotics (vet), frequent milking |
| **Urinary stones** (bucks) | Straining, dribbling urine | High grain, mineral imbalance | Vet (surgery), prevention (hay-based diet) |
| **Foot rot** | Limping, foul smell | Bacteria (wet conditions) | Trim hooves, antibiotic spray, zinc sulfate footbath |
| **Pneumonia** | Coughing, nasal discharge, fever | Stress, poor ventilation | Antibiotics (vet), good ventilation |
| **Pregnancy toxemia** | Lethargy, grinding teeth (late pregnancy) | Energy deficit (twins/triplets) | Propylene glycol, vet care (emergency) |

### When to Cull

- Chronic health issues (heavy parasite resistance)
- Poor udder conformation (milking difficulty)
- Aggressive temperament (safety)
- Poor production (after 2-3 lactations)

## Meat Production

**Butchering Age:** 6-12 months (80-100 lbs live weight)
**Yield:** 40-50% of live weight (bone-in cuts)

**Example:** 100 lb goat → 40-50 lbs meat

**Meat Quality:**
- Young goats (kids) = mild, tender ("cabrito")
- Older goats = stronger flavor, tougher (stew, ground)

**Uses:** Roasts, chops, ground, sausage, jerky

## Why Goats Are Critical

**Homestead Value:**
- **Milk:** 300-600 quarts/year (1 doe) = cheese, yogurt, soap
- **Meat:** 40-50 lbs per goat (harvest extra males)
- **Brush clearing:** Free land management (reclaim overgrown areas)
- **Manure:** Nitrogen-rich fertilizer (pelleted, easy to handle)
- **Leather:** Tanning hides (durable, soft leather)

**Economics:**
- **Setup:** $500-1500 (fencing, shelter, initial goats)
- **Feed:** $30-60/month (2-3 goats, hay + grain)
- **Milk value:** $4-6/quart (if purchased) = $100-150/month (1 good milker)
- **ROI:** 12-18 months

**Resilience:**
- Fast reproduction (kids at 7-9 months, breed annually)
- Thrive on marginal land (don't compete with crops)
- Multiple products (diversification)

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Weak fencing (goats escape) | Woven wire + electric, 5 ft high, buried/apron |
| Only 1 goat (lonely, stressed) | Minimum 2 goats (herd animals) |
| Sheep minerals (copper deficiency) | Goat-specific minerals (higher copper) |
| Inconsistent milking times | 12 hours apart, daily (production drops) |
| No hoof trimming (foot rot, lameness) | Trim every 6-8 weeks |
| Buck near milk does (taints flavor) | Separate buck 100+ ft upwind |
| Overfeeding grain (bloat, urinary stones) | Hay-based diet, grain as supplement only |
