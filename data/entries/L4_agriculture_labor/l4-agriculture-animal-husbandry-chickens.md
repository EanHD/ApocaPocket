# Animal Husbandry: Chickens - L4 Agriculture

**Priority: VERY HIGH** | **Difficulty: Easy** | **Impact: Reliable protein + eggs + manure**

## Overview

Chickens are the gateway livestock - easy to keep, fast to reproduce, dual-purpose (eggs + meat), and they turn scraps into protein. A small backyard flock can provide eggs daily and meat quarterly with minimal space and investment. This is the first animal every civilization-restart settlement should establish.

## Why Chickens First?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Small space (20-30 sq ft per bird total)
- ✅ Quick maturity (18-22 weeks to eggs, 8-12 weeks to meat)
- ✅ Low feed cost (forage + scraps + minimal grain)
- ✅ High egg production (200-300 eggs/year per hen)
- ✅ Excellent manure (nitrogen-rich for composting)
- ✅ Pest control (eat bugs, ticks, weed seeds)
- ✅ Easy to handle (small, docile)
- ✅ Legal in most urban/suburban areas

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Predator vulnerable (need secure housing)
- ❌ Daily care required (can't leave for days)
- ❌ Noise (roosters crow, hens cackle)
- ❌ Smell if poorly managed (clean regularly)

**Comparison:** 
- Chickens vs Goats: Easier, smaller, faster production
- Chickens vs Rabbits: More robust, better pest control, dual-purpose
- Chickens vs Cattle: 1/100 the space, 1/10 the time to production

## Housing Requirements

### Coop (Indoor Space)

**Size:** 4 sq ft per bird minimum
- 5-6 birds = 24-30 sq ft coop (6×5 ft)
- 10 birds = 40-50 sq ft (8×6 ft)

**Features Required:**
1. **Roosts:** 8-10" per bird, 2-4 ft high
   - 2×4 boards (wide side up)
   - Rounded edges (comfortable feet)
   - Higher roosts = preferred (pecking order)

2. **Nesting Boxes:** 1 box per 3-4 hens
   - Size: 12×12×12 inches
   - Filled with straw, wood shavings, or hay
   - Slightly dim/private (hens prefer)
   - 2-3 ft off ground (access ramp if needed)

3. **Ventilation:** Critical (prevent respiratory disease)
   - Vents near roof (heat/moisture escape)
   - Draft-free at bird level
   - 1 sq ft vent per 10 sq ft floor

4. **Insulation:** Optional (depends on climate)
   - Not needed in mild climates
   - Insulate walls/ceiling in <0°F winters
   - **Heat NOT recommended** (fire risk, dependency)

5. **Access Door:** Human-sized for cleaning (weekly)

6. **Pop Door:** Chicken-sized (12×12"), 12-18" high
   - Opens to run
   - Lockable (close at night)

### Run (Outdoor Space)

**Size:** 10 sq ft per bird minimum (more is better)
- 5-6 birds = 50-60 sq ft (8×8 ft)
- 10 birds = 100+ sq ft (10×10 ft)

**Construction:**
- **Fencing:** Chicken wire or hardware cloth
  - Height: 6 ft (chickens fly)
  - Buried: 12" underground or 18" apron (predators dig)
  - **Hardware cloth >> chicken wire** (weasels/rats bite through wire)
  
- **Roof:** Net or solid cover
  - Hawks attack from above
  - Weather protection (sun/rain)
  
- **Ground:** Options:
  - Dirt/grass (chickens will denude it)
  - Sand (drains well, easy to clean)
  - Concrete (clean, but hard on feet)
  - Deep litter (wood chips, compost in place)

### Predator Protection (CRITICAL)

**Common Predators:**
- Raccoons (smart, dexterous - use complex latches)
- Foxes/coyotes (dig, climb)
- Weasels/mink (squeeze through 1" gaps)
- Hawks/owls (daytime/night aerial)
- Dogs (neighbor's or wild)
- Snakes (eat eggs/chicks)
- Rats (eat eggs, kill chicks)

**Defense Layers:**
1. **Hardware cloth** (1/2" or 1/4") - not chicken wire
2. **Buried fence** or apron (dig prevention)
3. **Secure latches** (carabiners, complex locks - not simple hooks)
4. **Close at night** (most predators are nocturnal)
5. **Motion lights** or radio (deter nighttime predators)
6. **Guardian animals** (dog, llama, donkey) for large flocks

**⚠️ WARNING:** Predator kills are devastating. Invest in good security upfront.

## Feeding

### Commercial Feed (Easiest)

| Type | Age | Protein | Use |
|------|-----|---------|-----|
| **Chick Starter** | 0-6 weeks | 18-20% | Growing chicks |
| **Grower** | 6-18 weeks | 16-18% | Pullets before laying |
| **Layer** | 18+ weeks | 16-18% + calcium | Laying hens |
| **Broiler/Meat** | 0-8 weeks | 20-22% | Meat birds (rapid growth) |

**Amount:** ~1/4 lb (1/2 cup) per bird per day
- 6 hens = 1.5 lbs/day = 45 lbs/month = ~$15-25/month

**Feed Types:**
- **Pellets:** Uniform, less waste (recommended)
- **Crumbles:** Like pellets but broken (chicks, easier to eat)
- **Mash:** Powdery, messy, most waste (avoid)

**Supplements:**
- **Oyster shell:** Free-choice (calcium for strong eggshells)
- **Grit:** Insoluble (small rocks) for digestion (if no access to dirt)

### Kitchen Scraps (Supplement, Not Primary)

**Yes (Safe):**
- Vegetable scraps (all types)
- Fruit (not too much - sugar)
- Cooked rice, pasta, oatmeal
- Bread (in moderation)
- Meat scraps (cooked)
- Fish scraps

**No (Toxic/Harmful):**
- ❌ Raw potato/potato peels (solanine)
- ❌ Avocado skin/pit (persin)
- ❌ Chocolate (theobromine)
- ❌ Onions/garlic (large amounts - anemia)
- ❌ Dried/undercooked beans (lectins)
- ❌ Moldy food (mycotoxins)
- ❌ Salty/sugary processed food

**Ratio:** 10-20% of diet from scraps (rest from grain/feed)

### Foraging (Free-Range or Supervised)

**Chickens Eat:**
- Grass, clover, weeds
- Insects, grubs, worms (high protein!)
- Seeds, berries, fallen fruit
- Ticks (excellent tick control)

**Free-Ranging:**
- **Pros:** Lower feed cost, happier chickens, better eggs (orange yolks)
- **Cons:** Higher predation risk, less control, may damage garden

**Supervised/Tractor:**
- Chicken tractor = mobile coop (move daily)
- Controlled grazing (prevent overgrazing one area)
- Lower predation (enclosed)

**Feed Savings:** Free-range reduces feed by 25-50% (seasonal)

### Emergency/Self-Sufficient Feeding

**Grow Your Own Feed:**
- **Corn:** High energy (crack or grind)
- **Wheat:** Whole grains (scatter for foraging)
- **Field peas/beans:** Protein source (cooked)
- **Sunflowers:** Fats, protein (heads for pecking)
- **Squash/pumpkin:** Vitamins, dewormer (seeds)

**Foraging Maximization:**
- Rotate grazing areas (prevent parasites)
- Plant forage crops (kale, chard, comfrey)
- Allow access to compost pile (bugs, greens)

**Protein in Winter:**
- Mealworm farm (easy, high protein)
- Dried insects (stored)
- Fish scraps (if available)

**Rule:** ~16-18% protein diet minimum for laying hens

## Egg Production

### Timeline
- **Hatch to laying:** 18-22 weeks (breed dependent)
- **Peak production:** 6 months - 2 years old
- **Production decline:** ~10% per year after 2 years
- **Laying lifespan:** 5-7 years (slows significantly after year 3)

### Production Rates

| Breed | Eggs/Year | Egg Size | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Leghorn** | 280-320 | Large | Best layer, flighty |
| **Rhode Island Red** | 250-300 | Large | Dual-purpose, hardy |
| **Sussex** | 250-280 | Large | Calm, good forager |
| **Plymouth Rock** | 200-280 | Large | Dual-purpose, docile |
| **Orpington** | 180-220 | Large | Broody, good mothers |
| **Australorp** | 250-300 | Large | Calm, heat-tolerant |

**Factors Affecting Production:**
- **Light:** 14-16 hours/day needed (artificial light in winter)
- **Nutrition:** Layer feed + calcium + water
- **Stress:** Predators, moving, changes reduce laying
- **Molting:** Annual feather replacement (6-8 weeks no eggs)
- **Broodiness:** Some hens stop laying to hatch (break broodiness or let them raise chicks)

### Egg Collection

**Frequency:** 1-2x daily (morning + afternoon)
- Prevents egg eating (chickens develop bad habit)
- Prevents freezing (winter)
- Prevents cracking (heat)

**Storage:**
- **Unwashed:** 2-3 weeks room temp (natural bloom protects)
- **Refrigerated:** 4-5 weeks
- **Washed:** Refrigerate immediately (2-3 weeks)

**Washing:** Only wash before use (not storage)
- Use water warmer than egg (prevents bacteria entering)
- Dry immediately

## Breeding

### Flock Composition
- **Layers only:** 0 roosters (all hens lay unfertilized eggs)
- **Breeding flock:** 1 rooster per 8-12 hens
  - More roosters = fighting, over-mating hens (feather damage)
  - Fewer hens = over-mated (stress, injury)

**Rooster Pros:**
- Fertile eggs (hatch chicks)
- Flock protection (alert, defensive)
- Natural behavior

**Rooster Cons:**
- Noisy (crow at dawn + throughout day)
- Aggressive (to humans, other roosters)
- Not needed for eggs

### Incubation

**Natural (Broody Hen):**
1. Hen stops laying, sits on nest constantly (fluffs up, growls)
2. Collect fertile eggs (up to 12), place under hen
3. **Duration:** 21 days (chicken incubation period)
4. Hen turns eggs, regulates temp, protects chicks
5. Chicks hatch, hen raises them (no human intervention)

**Artificial (Incubator):**
1. Collect fertile eggs daily (store <10 days, pointed end down, 50-60°F)
2. Set incubator: 99.5°F, 50-55% humidity (days 1-18)
3. Turn eggs 3-5x daily (or automatic turner)
4. Day 18: Stop turning, increase humidity to 65-70% (lockdown)
5. Day 21: Chicks hatch (do not help - let them break out)
6. Dry 12-24 hours in incubator, move to brooder

**Brooder Setup (Chicks 0-6 weeks):**
- Container: Box, tub, or small coop (1/2 sq ft per chick)
- Heat: 95°F week 1, decrease 5°F/week until room temp
- Heat source: Heat lamp (red bulb safer) or plate heater
- Bedding: Pine shavings (NOT cedar - toxic)
- Food: Chick starter (medicated prevents coccidiosis)
- Water: Shallow dish (chicks drown easily - use marbles to reduce depth)

### Breed Selection

**Dual-Purpose (Eggs + Meat):**
- Rhode Island Red, Plymouth Rock, Sussex, Orpington, Wyandotte

**Egg Specialists:**
- Leghorn, Australorp, Sex-link hybrids

**Meat Specialists:**
- Cornish Cross (8-10 weeks to 5-6 lbs)
- Freedom Rangers (12-14 weeks, slower but forages well)

**Heritage/Rare:**
- Preserve genetic diversity (modern breeds narrowing)
- Often hardier, better foragers, longer-lived
- **Example:** Buckeye, Dominique, Chantecler

## Health & Common Issues

### Preventive Care

**Daily:**
- Fresh water (clean drinker)
- Check for injury, lethargy, unusual behavior

**Weekly:**
- Clean droppings from roosts
- Refill feed, check for pests

**Monthly:**
- Deep clean coop (remove all bedding, scrub)
- Check for mites/lice (look at vent, under wings)
- Inspect feet (bumblefoot)

### Common Diseases

| Disease | Symptoms | Prevention | Treatment |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Coccidiosis** | Bloody droppings, lethargy | Medicated chick starter, clean water | Amprolium (Corid) |
| **Marek's Disease** | Paralysis, tumors | Vaccinate day-old chicks | None (cull) |
| **Respiratory** (CRD) | Sneezing, gurgling, discharge | Good ventilation, no overcrowding | Antibiotics (vet) |
| **Egg Binding** | Hen straining, no egg | Calcium, proper nutrition | Warm bath, lubricate vent |
| **Mites/Lice** | Feather loss, pale combs | Dust baths, DE powder | Permethrin spray |

**When to Cull:**
- Severe disease (prevent spread)
- Aggressive rooster (safety risk)
- Persistent non-layer (eats without producing)

### Biosecurity

- Quarantine new birds (30 days) before mixing flock
- Limit visitor access to coop
- Change clothes/shoes after visiting other flocks
- Disinfect equipment between uses
- Remove dead birds immediately (disease vector)

## Butchering (Meat Birds)

**Age:** 8-12 weeks (broilers), 16-20 weeks (dual-purpose)
**Weight:** 4-6 lbs live = 3-4 lbs dressed

### Process Overview

**⚠️ Graphic Content Warning**

1. **Fast:** 12-24 hours (empty crop/intestines)
2. **Kill:** Sharp knife, cut jugular veins (quick, humane)
   - Or use killing cone (humane, contains flapping)
3. **Bleed:** 2-3 minutes (hang upside down)
4. **Scald:** 140-160°F water, 30-60 seconds (loosens feathers)
5. **Pluck:** Pull feathers (easier while warm)
6. **Eviscerate:** Remove organs (save heart, liver, gizzard)
7. **Rinse:** Cold water bath
8. **Age:** Refrigerate 24-48 hours (improves tenderness)
9. **Package:** Freeze or cook fresh

**Time:** 15-30 minutes per bird (improves with practice)

**Yield:** 65-75% of live weight (bone-in)

## Why Chickens Are Critical

**Food Security:**
- 1 hen = 200-300 eggs/year = 16-25 lbs protein
- 10 hens = 2000+ eggs/year = 160-200 lbs protein
- Meat: 1 batch (25 broilers) = 75-100 lbs meat (12 weeks)

**Waste Conversion:**
- Kitchen scraps → eggs/meat
- Manure → compost → vegetables (closed loop)

**Low Investment:**
- Setup: $200-500 (coop + birds)
- Feed: $15-30/month (6 hens)
- ROI: Eggs pay for feed within 6 months

**Resilience:**
- Fast reproduction (flock doubles in 6 months)
- Minimal infrastructure
- Barter currency (eggs universally valued)

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Weak predator protection | Hardware cloth, buried/apron fence, secure latches |
| Only chicken wire (predators break through) | 1/2" or 1/4" hardware cloth |
| Overcrowding (disease, stress) | 4 sq ft indoor + 10 sq ft outdoor minimum |
| Poor ventilation (respiratory disease) | High vents, draft-free at bird level |
| All roosters (fighting) | 1 rooster per 8-12 hens max |
| Expecting immediate eggs | 18-22 weeks to first egg |
| Dirty water (disease) | Clean daily, fresh water |
