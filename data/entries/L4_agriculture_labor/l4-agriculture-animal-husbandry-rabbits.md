# Animal Husbandry: Rabbits - L4 Agriculture

**Priority: HIGH** | **Difficulty: Easy-Medium** | **Impact: Most efficient meat per lb feed**

## Overview

Rabbits are the hidden champion of homestead livestock. They produce more edible meat per pound of feed than any other animal, reproduce exponentially, require minimal space, and are silent. A trio (1 buck + 2 does) can produce 200-300 lbs of meat annually in a 20 sq ft area. For small spaces, limited feed, or maximum efficiency, rabbits are unmatched.

## Why Rabbits?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Feed conversion ratio:** 4:1 (4 lbs feed → 1 lb meat vs 6-10:1 for chickens, pigs)
- ✅ **Space efficient:** 4 sq ft per rabbit (vs 100+ for goat, 1000+ for cow)
- ✅ **Fast reproduction:** 30-day gestation, 6-10 kits, rebreed every 45-60 days
- ✅ **Exponential growth:** 1 pair → 50+ offspring per year
- ✅ **Silent:** No noise complaints (urban-friendly)
- ✅ **White meat:** Lean, mild flavor (like chicken)
- ✅ **Multiple products:** Meat, fur, leather, manure
- ✅ **Minimal startup cost:** $100-300 for breeding trio + cages

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Some people find butchering difficult (cute factor)
- ❌ Heat sensitive (require cooling in hot climates)
- ❌ Requires daily feeding/watering (no free-ranging)
- ❌ Predator vulnerable (need secure housing)
- ❌ Individual processing (many small carcasses vs few large)

**Comparison:**
- **Rabbits vs Chickens:** 2x feed efficiency, no eggs but more meat per animal
- **Rabbits vs Goats:** 1/10 space, 2x faster reproduction, meat-only (no milk)
- **Rabbits vs Cattle:** 1/200 space, same feed efficiency, 1/50 size

**The Math:**
- 1 doe = 40-50 kits/year = 150-200 lbs meat/year
- 2 does = 300-400 lbs meat/year (feeds 2-3 people)
- **From 20 sq ft of hutch space**

## Breeds: Choose Your Purpose

### Meat Breeds (Best for Homestead)

| Breed | Mature Weight | Growth Rate | Litter Size | Temperament | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **New Zealand White** | 9-12 lbs | Fast (8-10 weeks to 5 lbs) | 8-10 kits | Calm | Industry standard, proven |
| **Californian** | 8-11 lbs | Fast | 8-10 kits | Docile | Good meat, nice pelt |
| **Florida White** | 4-6 lbs | Medium | 6-8 kits | Gentle | Compact, all-purpose |
| **Satin** | 9-11 lbs | Fast | 8-10 kits | Calm | Beautiful fur, dual-purpose |
| **Silver Fox** | 10-12 lbs | Medium | 6-8 kits | Docile | Rare, luxurious fur |

**Recommended Starter:** New Zealand White or Californian (proven, available, hardy)

### Dual-Purpose (Meat + Fur/Fiber)

| Breed | Mature Weight | Specialty | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Rex** | 8-10 lbs | Velvet fur (pelts) | Plush coat, good meat |
| **Angora** | 5-10 lbs | Fiber (wool) | Requires grooming, harvest wool |
| **American Chinchilla** | 9-12 lbs | Beautiful pelt | Rare heritage breed |

**Choose Dual-Purpose If:** Want additional products beyond meat

### Size Categories

- **Small:** 3-5 lbs (Florida White) - more per cage, less meat per rabbit
- **Medium:** 6-9 lbs (Dutch, Rex) - balanced
- **Large:** 9-12 lbs (New Zealand, Californian) - most meat per rabbit, best feed efficiency
- **Giant:** 13-20+ lbs (Flemish Giant) - slower growth, less efficient (avoid for meat production)

**Best for Meat:** Large breeds (9-12 lbs mature)

## Housing

### Hutch Requirements

**Size per Rabbit:**
- **Breeding doe/buck:** 4-6 sq ft floor space (24×30" minimum)
- **Grow-out (fryers):** 1.5-2 sq ft per rabbit (group housing)
- **Height:** 18-24" (rabbit should sit upright comfortably)

**Example Setup (1 buck + 2 does):**
- 3 breeding cages (30×36×18" each) = 18 sq ft
- 1-2 grow-out cages (36×48×18") for litters = 24 sq ft
- **Total:** ~20-30 sq ft

### Cage Construction

**Materials:**

**Option 1: Wire Cages (Best)**
- **Sides/Top:** 1×2" wire mesh (14-16 gauge)
- **Floor:** 1/2×1" wire (14 gauge) - allows droppings to fall through
- **Advantages:** Easy cleaning, good airflow, durable
- **Disadvantages:** Cold in winter (add resting board)

**Option 2: Wood Hutches**
- **Frame:** 2×4 lumber, exterior plywood
- **Floor:** Wire or slats (must allow droppings through)
- **Advantages:** Warmer in winter
- **Disadvantages:** Hard to clean, shorter lifespan (urine rots wood)

**Option 3: Colony System**
- Large pen (10×10 ft) with multiple rabbits
- **Pros:** Natural behavior, less individual caging
- **Cons:** Harder to manage breeding, potential fighting, disease spread
- **Use case:** Experienced keepers only

**Features:**
1. **Feeders:** J-feeders (attach to cage door) - prevent waste
2. **Waterers:** Bottles (winter) or bowls (summer) - 32 oz minimum
3. **Nest box:** 10×18×10" (provide for kindling - birthing)
4. **Resting board:** Flat wood board (relief from wire floor)

### Location

**Ideal Setup:**
- **Shade:** Critical (rabbits overheat easily)
  - >85°F = heat stress (provide frozen water bottles, fans, misters)
- **Protection from elements:** Rain, wind, direct sun
  - Covered roof (barn, shed, or tarps)
- **Ventilation:** Good airflow (prevent respiratory disease)
- **Predator protection:** Secure from dogs, raccoons, weasels, hawks
  - Wire floors + secure latches

**Temperature Range:**
- **Ideal:** 50-70°F
- **Tolerable:** 40-80°F
- **Danger:** <20°F (add straw bedding, windbreaks) or >85°F (cooling measures)

## Feeding

### Commercial Pellets (Easiest, Most Reliable)

**Type:** Rabbit pellets (16-18% protein)

**Amount:**
| Rabbit Type | Age/Stage | Feed/Day |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Bucks** (maintenance) | Adult | 4-6 oz (1/2 cup) |
| **Does** (maintenance) | Adult | 4-6 oz |
| **Pregnant does** | Last 2 weeks | 6-8 oz |
| **Lactating does** | With litter | Unlimited (8-12 oz) |
| **Grow-outs (fryers)** | 4-12 weeks | Unlimited (4-6 oz) |

**Cost:** $15-25 per 50 lb bag (feeds 1 breeding doe ~3 months)

**Storage:** Cool, dry, dark (prevent mold)
- Use within 6 months (nutrients degrade)

**Why Pellets?**
- Complete nutrition (balanced protein, vitamins, minerals)
- Consistent (no guessing)
- Easy to store

### Hay (Essential Supplement)

**Type:** Grass hay (timothy, orchard grass) or alfalfa

**Purpose:**
- Fiber (prevents GI stasis - killer condition)
- Entertainment (prevents boredom)
- Dental health (wears down constantly-growing teeth)

**Amount:** Unlimited (always available)

**Quality:** Green, dry, no mold (moldy hay = death)

### Fresh Greens (Supplement)

**Safe Greens (in moderation):**
- Lettuce (not iceberg), kale, chard, parsley
- Carrot tops, beet greens
- Dandelion greens, clover, plantain (from yard - no pesticides)
- Comfrey (excellent - nutrient-dense)

**Introduction:** Slowly (sudden change = diarrhea)
- Start with 1-2 oz/day, increase gradually

**Proportion:** Greens = 10-20% of diet (not replacement for pellets/hay)

**❌ Avoid:**
- Iceberg lettuce (no nutrition, diarrhea)
- Rhubarb leaves (toxic)
- Potato/tomato leaves (toxic)
- Avocado (toxic)

### Water

**Critical:** Fresh, clean water at all times
- 16-32 oz per rabbit/day (more if lactating, hot weather)
- **Winter:** Heated waterers or change water 2-3x/day (prevent freezing)
- **Summer:** Cool water (helps with heat stress)

**Container:** Bottles (prevent spillage) or heavy ceramic bowls (can't tip)

### Self-Sufficient Feeding (No Pellets)

**Possible but challenging.** Requires knowledge and observation.

**Components:**
1. **Hay (basis):** Grass or legume hay (free-choice)
2. **Grains:** Oats, barley, wheat (2-4 oz/day)
3. **Greens:** Fresh forage (varies by season)
4. **Protein:** Alfalfa hay (growing/lactating rabbits)
5. **Mineral supplement:** Salt, kelp

**Challenges:**
- Seasonal variation (less greens in winter)
- Nutritional imbalances (slower growth, lower reproduction)
- More labor (daily foraging/prep)

**Recommendation:** Use pellets if available (reliability > self-sufficiency in most scenarios)

## Breeding

### Breeding Age

- **Does:** 6-8 months (or 5-6 lbs, 80% mature weight)
- **Bucks:** 6-8 months
- **⚠️ Don't breed too young:** Underdeveloped does may have complications

### Breeding Method

**Always take doe to buck's cage (never vice versa).**
- Territorial behavior: Does fight in their own space, bucks don't

**Process:**
1. Place doe in buck's cage
2. Buck mounts, breeds (seconds - quick!)
3. **Fall-off:** Buck falls off to side/back (indicates successful breeding)
4. Allow second breeding (5-10 minutes later) - increases conception
5. Return doe to her cage
6. **Record date** (critical for timing kindling)

**Signs Doe is Receptive:**
- Presenting (raises hindquarters)
- Active, interested in buck
- **Vent color:** Dark pink/purple = receptive, pale = not ready

**If Doe Refuses:**
- Try different buck
- Wait 1-2 days, try again
- Check vent color (hormone cycle)

### Gestation & Kindling (Birth)

**Gestation:** 28-32 days (average 31 days)

**Day 10-14:** Palpation (feel for marble-sized embryos) - experienced breeders only

**Day 28:** Provide nest box
- Fill with straw/hay
- Doe will pull fur to line nest (day 28-31)

**Kindling (usually at night):**
- Does give birth alone (no assistance needed usually)
- 6-10 kits born in 10-30 minutes
- Doe eats placenta (normal), pulls fur over kits

**Morning After:**
- **Check nest:** Remove dead kits (DOA or stillborn - 10-20% normal)
- Count live kits
- Ensure all covered with fur (warmth critical)
- **Don't over-handle:** Briefly check, then leave alone

**Kits:**
- Born blind, deaf, hairless (altricial)
- Eyes open day 10-12
- Leave nest day 18-21

### Litter Management

**Litter Size:**
- First-time does: 4-6 kits (often smaller)
- Experienced does: 8-10 kits

**Culling/Fostering:**
- **If >10 kits:** Foster excess to another doe (same kindling date ±3 days)
  - Rub kits with foster doe's fur (mask scent)
- **If <6 kits:** Fine (more milk per kit, faster growth)

**Doe Feeding:**
- Unlimited pellets + hay (milk production is energy-intensive)
- Ensure constant water (dehydration = stops nursing)

**Weaning:** 
- Age: 6-8 weeks
- Weight: 3-4 lbs
- Method: Remove kits to grow-out cage, leave doe in breeding cage
- **Rebreeding:** Wean kits, wait 1-2 weeks, rebreed doe

**Breeding Schedule Options:**

**Intensive (Every 45 Days):**
- Breed doe → Kindle (day 31) → Wean (day 42) → Rebreed (day 45)
- **Output:** 7-8 litters/year = 50-70 kits/doe/year
- **Stress:** High on doe (feed well, cull does that can't keep up)

**Moderate (Every 60-75 Days):**
- Breed → Kindle → Wean (6-8 weeks) → Rest 2-3 weeks → Rebreed
- **Output:** 5-6 litters/year = 40-50 kits/doe/year
- **Recommended:** Sustainable, good doe health

**Seasonal:**
- Breed spring + fall (avoid summer heat stress)
- **Output:** 2-3 litters/year = 20-30 kits/doe/year
- **Use case:** Hot climates, limited feed availability

## Growth & Harvest

### Timeline

| Age (Weeks) | Weight | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0 | 2-3 oz | Newborn | In nest |
| 3 | 1-1.5 lbs | Leaving nest | Still nursing |
| 6-8 | 3-4 lbs | Weaned | Move to grow-out |
| 10-12 | 5-6 lbs | **Fryer (butcher)** | Ideal harvest |
| 16-20 | 7-9 lbs | Roaster | Large carcass, tougher |
| 24+ | 9-12+ lbs | Breeder or cull | Meat quality declines |

**Optimal Harvest Age:** 10-12 weeks (5-6 lbs live weight)
- **Why:** Best feed conversion, tender meat, before sexual maturity (fighting)

**Dressed Weight:** 50-55% of live weight
- 5 lb live rabbit → 2.5-3 lbs dressed weight

**Sex Determination (Week 8):**
- Select best females for breeding replacements
- All males + extra females → meat

### The Exponential Growth Model

**Starting Trio:** 1 buck + 2 does

**Year 1 (Moderate Breeding):**
- 2 does × 5 litters/year × 8 kits = 80 kits born
- 50% survival/kept = 40 rabbits
- Keep 6 best females → Now have 8 does + 2 bucks
- Harvest: 34 rabbits = ~100 lbs meat

**Year 2:**
- 8 does × 5 litters × 8 kits = 320 kits born
- Harvest: 300+ rabbits = ~900 lbs meat
- **1 pair → 300 rabbits in 18 months**

**This is exponential food production.**

## Processing (Butchering)

**⚠️ Graphic Content**

**Age:** 10-12 weeks (fryer weight)

**Tools:**
- Sharp knife
- Game shears or poultry shears
- Cool water for rinsing
- Bags for packaging

### Process (Overview)

1. **Dispatch:** Sharp blow to base of skull or cervical dislocation
   - Instant, humane
2. **Bleed:** Hang by hind legs, cut jugular (1-2 minutes)
3. **Skin:** 
   - Cut around hind legs, peel skin like removing sock
   - Skin comes off in one piece
4. **Eviscerate:** 
   - Cut from pelvis to sternum (don't puncture intestines)
   - Remove organs (save heart, liver, kidneys if desired)
5. **Rinse:** Cold water
6. **Chill:** Refrigerate 24 hours (improves tenderness)
7. **Package:** Freeze or cook fresh

**Time:** 10-15 minutes per rabbit (with practice)

**Yield:** 1 fryer (5 lbs live) = 2.5-3 lbs meat = 4-5 servings

**Pelts (Bonus):**
- Stretch on frame, dry (tanning later)
- Use: Gloves, trim, crafts, trade
- Value: $5-15 per pelt (depending on quality, breed)

## Health & Common Issues

**Rabbits are generally hardy.** Main issues:

### Preventive Care

- **Clean cages:** Remove droppings weekly (prevents ammonia buildup)
- **Dry environment:** Wet = respiratory disease, sore hocks
- **Good ventilation:** Prevent respiratory disease
- **Predator-proof:** Stress kills (dogs barking, predators prowling)
- **Quarantine new rabbits:** 30 days (prevent disease spread)

### Common Problems

| Issue | Symptoms | Cause | Treatment |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **GI Stasis** | Not eating, no droppings | Low fiber, stress, dehydration | Hay, water, belly massage (vet if severe) |
| **Snuffles** (Pasteurella) | Sneezing, discharge, matted paws | Bacteria (stress-triggered) | Antibiotics (vet), cull chronic cases |
| **Sore Hocks** | Red, raw feet | Wire floor, heavy rabbit, dirty cage | Resting boards, treat with ointment |
| **Heat Stress** | Panting, lethargy, drooling | >85°F temperature | Frozen bottles, fans, shade, cool water |
| **Ear Mites** | Head shaking, crusty ears | Mites | Ivermectin or oil treatment |
| **Malocclusion** | Overgrown teeth, not eating | Genetic (misaligned teeth) | Trim teeth (vet) or cull |
| **Coccidiosis** | Diarrhea, weight loss (young rabbits) | Parasite (Eimeria) | Amprolium, cleanliness |

**When to Cull:**
- Chronic health issues (snuffles, malocclusion)
- Aggressive temperament (bites, attacks)
- Poor mothering (eats kits, won't nurse)
- Low production (small litters, poor growth)

### No Vaccines Needed

Unlike chickens (Marek's) or goats (CDT), rabbits don't require routine vaccinations in most areas.

**Exception:** RHDV2 (Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus)
- Vaccine available in endemic areas (check local regulations)

## Manure Gold

**Rabbit manure is unique:** Can be applied directly to garden (doesn't "burn" plants)

**NPK:** ~2.4-1.4-0.6 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium)

**Uses:**
1. **Direct application:** Scatter on garden (no composting required)
2. **Compost ingredient:** Excellent nitrogen source (mix with bedding/hay)
3. **Manure tea:** Soak in water (liquid fertilizer)
4. **Worm composting:** Worms love rabbit manure (vermicomposting)

**Output:** 1 rabbit = ~100 lbs manure/year

## Why Rabbits Are Critical

**Survival Math:**
- **Setup:** $200-400 (trio + cages + feeders/waterers)
- **Feed cost:** $30-50/month (3 breeders + grow-outs)
- **Output:** 200-300 lbs meat/year (from 20 sq ft)
- **Equivalent:** 600-900 meals worth of protein

**Per Square Foot:**
- Rabbits: ~10-15 lbs meat/sq ft/year
- Chickens: ~3-5 lbs meat/sq ft/year
- Goats: ~0.2-0.5 lbs meat/sq ft/year

**Rabbits are THE most space-efficient livestock.**

**Other Benefits:**
- Silent (apartment/urban viable)
- Fast reproduction (rebuild flock quickly if disaster)
- Quality manure (garden productivity)
- Pelts (clothing, trade goods)

**Resilience:**
- Small startup (vs cattle, pigs)
- Fast growth (meat in 10 weeks vs 6+ months)
- Exponential scaling (1 pair → hundreds in 1 year)

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| No shade (heat stress kills) | Full shade in summer, >85°F = cooling measures |
| Breeding buck to multiple does same day | 1-2 breedings/day max (sperm depletion) |
| Taking buck to doe's cage (fighting) | Always take doe to buck |
| No nest box (kits freeze) | Provide day 28 (does line with fur) |
| Handling kits excessively (doe rejects) | Brief check, minimal handling first week |
| Dirty cages (ammonia, disease) | Clean weekly, good ventilation |
| Moldy hay (enterotoxemia kills) | Inspect hay, discard any mold |
| Overbreeding does (burnout) | Moderate schedule, cull poor producers |
