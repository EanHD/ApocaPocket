summary: Pottery provides waterproof containers for cooking, storage, and transport. Hand-building techniques (pinch, coil, slab) require no wheel. Pit firing (campfire or earth kiln) achieves temps needed
  to harden clay. Primitive pottery is porous but functional.
warnings:
- Pottery can crack or explode during firing if dried improperly or contains air bubbles
- Pit-fired pottery is porous - not fully waterproof unless sealed with pitch or oil
- Large thick pieces are prone to cracking - start small and thin
steps:
- 'CLAY PREP: Use tested clay (see clay ID entry). Wedge clay (knead like dough) to remove air bubbles. Add temper (sand 10-20 percent).'
- 'HAND-BUILDING: PINCH POT - Start with ball, press thumb into center, pinch walls thin while rotating. COIL - Roll clay into ropes, stack in spiral, smooth joins. SLAB - Flatten clay, cut shapes, join
  edges. Start with simple bowl or cup.'
- 'DRYING: CRITICAL. Dry SLOWLY (days to weeks) in shade. Fast drying causes cracks. Cover with plastic, uncover for few hours daily. Bone dry = ready to fire (no cool feel, very light).'
- 'PIT FIRING: Dig shallow pit. Build fire, let burn to coals. Place dried pottery in coals. Cover with more fuel (wood, dung). Fire for 4-8 hours. Let cool completely overnight. Pottery should be hard,
  ring when tapped. If cracked, try again with slower drying or more temper.'
- 'USES: Cooking (set in coals, not direct flame). Water storage (seal with pine pitch). Food storage (dry goods).'

# Pottery Basics — Hand-Building & Pit Firing

Pottery provides waterproof containers for cooking, storage, and transport. Hand-building techniques (pinch, coil, slab) require no wheel. Pit firing (campfire or earth kiln) achieves temps needed to harden clay. Primitive pottery is porous but functional.
