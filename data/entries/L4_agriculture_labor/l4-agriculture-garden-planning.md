summary: Plan garden for continuous harvest and soil health. Crop rotation prevents disease. Succession planting (plant every 2 weeks) provides steady supply. Prioritize high-calorie, storable crops (potatoes,
  beans, squash). Consider climate and season length.
warnings:
- Gardening is harder than it looks - expect failures first year
- Local climate matters - not all crops grow everywhere
- Pests and disease can destroy entire crop - plan for loss
steps:
- 'CROP SELECTION: STAPLES (high calorie, stores well): Potatoes, beans, squash, corn, wheat. VEGETABLES (nutrition): Tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, cabbage, onions. QUICK (harvest in weeks): Radishes, lettuce,
  spinach. LONG SEASON (months): Tomatoes, peppers, squash.'
- 'LAYOUT: Rows or beds. Tall plants (corn) on north side (do not shade shorter plants). Climbing plants (beans, peas) on trellis. Wide spacing (reduces disease but lower yield).'
- 'CROP ROTATION: Do not plant same family in same spot year after year (disease builds up). Rotate: Year 1 - tomatoes. Year 2 - beans. Year 3 - root vegetables. Year 4 - greens.'
- 'SUCCESSION PLANTING: Plant lettuce every 2 weeks (continuous harvest). Plant beans 3 times per season.'
- 'CALENDAR: Know frost dates. Plant cool-season crops (lettuce, peas) early spring and fall. Warm-season (tomatoes, peppers) after last frost.'

# Vegetable Garden Planning — Layout, Crop Selection, Rotation

Plan garden for continuous harvest and soil health. Crop rotation prevents disease. Succession planting (plant every 2 weeks) provides steady supply. Prioritize high-calorie, storable crops (potatoes, beans, squash). Consider climate and season length.
