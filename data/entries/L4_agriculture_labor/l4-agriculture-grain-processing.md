# Grain Processing - L4 Agriculture

**Priority: HIGH** | **Difficulty: Medium** | **Impact: Grain → flour without electricity**

## Overview

Grains are calorie-dense survival foods, but unusable without processing. Knowing how to thresh, winnow, and mill grain by hand transforms a field of wheat into bread flour. These are ancient techniques, proven over millennia, requiring only simple tools and muscle power.

## Step 1: Threshing (Separating Grain from Stalk)

**Goal:** Break grain kernels free from seed heads and stalks.

### Method 1: Flail Threshing (Traditional)

**Tool:** Flail (stick connected to handle by rope/leather)

**Technique:**
1. Spread dried grain stalks on hard surface (tarp, concrete, clean ground)
2. Beat stalks with flail, hitting seed heads repeatedly
3. Work systematically across pile
4. **Duration:** 30-60 minutes per bushel (60 lbs)

**DIY Flail:**
- Handle: 4-5 ft wooden pole
- Striker: 2-3 ft hardwood dowel or stick
- Connection: 6" rope, leather strap, or chain
- Tie striker to handle end (allows swinging motion)

### Method 2: Tarp Threshing (Easier, Slower)

**Technique:**
1. Place dried grain bundles in pillowcase or burlap sack
2. Beat sack against hard surface (ground, table, wall)
3. Alternatively: Stomp on sack repeatedly
4. **Duration:** 45-90 minutes per bushel

**Advantage:** Gentle on grain (less damage), less skill required

### Method 3: Vehicle Threshing (Fast, Large Scale)

**Technique:**
1. Spread grain on tarp or hard ground (6" deep max)
2. Drive vehicle over grain repeatedly (15-20 passes)
3. **Best vehicles:** Pickup truck, car (smooth tires)
4. **Duration:** 15-30 minutes per bushel

**⚠️ WARNING:** 
- Use clean tires (no oil, chemicals)
- Tarp must be clean (food-grade)
- Vehicle must be dry (no mud)
- Not suitable for human consumption if contamination risk

**Advantage:** Fast, handles large volumes (50-100+ lbs)

### Method 4: Sheet Threshing (Hand Method)

**Technique:**
1. Hold bundle of grain heads over bucket/tarp
2. Rub seed heads vigorously between palms
3. Seeds fall out, chaff remains in hands
4. **Duration:** 2-3 hours per bushel

**Advantage:** No tools needed, very gentle, clean

**Use Case:** Small batches, precious heirloom varieties

## Step 2: Winnowing (Separating Grain from Chaff)

**Goal:** Remove chaff (lightweight husks) from grain (heavy kernels) using wind.

### Technique

**Setup:**
1. Choose windy day (5-10 mph ideal) or use fan
2. Position two containers (bucket, bowl, tarp)
3. Stand so wind blows perpendicular to you

**Method:**
1. Scoop threshed grain + chaff mixture
2. Pour slowly from height (3-5 ft) into downwind container
3. Wind blows chaff away, grain falls into container
4. Repeat 3-5 times until clean

**Fine-Tuning:**
- Too much wind: Grain blows away (reduce height)
- Too little wind: Chaff stays mixed (increase height, wait for stronger wind)
- **Indoor:** Use fan on low setting, pour across airstream

**Alternative (No Wind):**
1. Pour grain down slight incline (tray, board)
2. Grain rolls farther, chaff sticks to incline
3. Collect grain at bottom

**Completion Test:** Blow handful of grain - if chaff flies away, done. If not, repeat winnowing.

**Yield Loss:** 10-20% weight from chaff (normal)

## Step 3: Milling (Grinding Grain to Flour)

### Stone Mill (Traditional, No Power)

**Types:**

**A. Hand-Crank Stone Mill**
- Two stone discs (granite or corundum)
- Adjustable gap controls coarseness
- Hand crank turns top stone
- **Capacity:** 1-2 lbs flour per 10-15 minutes
- **Cost:** $50-300 (new), DIY possible

**B. Pedal-Powered Mill**
- Bicycle-style mechanism drives stones
- 3-5x faster than hand crank
- **Capacity:** 1 lb flour per 3-5 minutes

**C. Mortar & Pestle (Emergency)**
- Stone or wood mortar + pestle
- Pound grain to crack, grind in circular motion
- **Capacity:** 1-2 cups flour per hour (exhausting)
- **Use:** Small batches, emergency only

### Operating a Stone Mill

**Setup:**
1. Clean mill thoroughly (brush, wipe)
2. Adjust gap setting:
   - Wide gap (1-2mm) = cracked grain, grits
   - Medium gap (0.5-1mm) = coarse flour
   - Narrow gap (0.2-0.5mm) = fine flour
3. Test with small amount (adjust if needed)

**Grinding:**
1. Pour grain into hopper (1-2 cups at a time)
2. Turn crank steadily (don't rush - consistent speed)
3. Grain feeds through stones, flour emerges at bottom
4. **Temperature:** Stones heat up - if too hot to touch, pause (overheating damages flour nutrients)

**Multi-Pass Technique (Fine Flour):**
1. First pass: Wide gap (crack grain)
2. Second pass: Medium gap (coarse flour)
3. Third pass: Narrow gap (fine flour)
4. **Advantage:** Easier on mill, more consistent flour, less heat

**Sifting:**
- Use fine-mesh sieve to separate bran from flour
- **Whole grain flour:** Use everything (most nutritious)
- **White flour:** Sift out bran (lighter texture, longer storage)
- **Bran:** Feed to animals or compost (don't waste)

### DIY Stone Mill (Emergency)

**Materials:**
- Two flat stones (granite, river rock) - 8-12" diameter
- Center hole drilled in top stone (dowel pivot)
- Handle attached to top stone

**Construction:**
1. Flatten bottom stone (grind against another stone if needed)
2. Drill 1" hole through center of top stone
3. Insert wooden dowel (pivot point)
4. Attach handle to top stone edge
5. Adjust gap by shimming bottom stone

**Effectiveness:** Slow, inconsistent, but functional. Better than nothing.

## Grain-Specific Processing

### Wheat (Most Common)

**Threshing:** Easy - flail or tarp method
**Winnowing:** Medium - chaff separates well
**Milling:** Medium - makes excellent flour
**Yield:** 1 lb wheat berries → ~3-4 cups flour

**Varieties:**
- **Hard red wheat:** Bread flour (high protein)
- **Soft white wheat:** Pastry flour (low protein)
- **Durum wheat:** Pasta (highest protein)

### Oats

**Threshing:** Easy - oats separate cleanly
**De-hulling Required:** Oats have tough outer hull
  - Method: Pound lightly with mortar/pestle, winnow again (hulls fly away)
  - Or: Use specialized oat roller
**Milling:** Medium - makes coarse flour or rolled oats
**Yield:** 1 lb oat groats → ~3.5 cups flour

**Use:** Oatmeal (rolled), baking (flour)

### Barley

**Threshing:** Easy
**De-hulling Required:** Like oats, needs hull removal
  - "Hulless barley" varieties exist (easier)
**Milling:** Easy - soft grain
**Yield:** 1 lb barley → ~3.5 cups flour

**Use:** Bread (dense), soup (pearled barley), beer (malted)

### Rye

**Threshing:** Easy - similar to wheat
**Winnowing:** Easy
**Milling:** Easy - softer than wheat
**Yield:** 1 lb rye → ~4 cups flour

**Use:** Rye bread (sour), whiskey

**Note:** Ergot risk (fungal contamination) - inspect carefully, discard any purple/black kernels

### Corn (Maize)

**Threshing:** Very easy - twist dried cobs, kernels fall off
**Winnowing:** Minimal chaff
**Milling:** Hard - requires heavy-duty mill or specialized tools

**Processing Methods:**
1. **Whole kernel:** Stone grind to cornmeal (coarse)
2. **Hominy:** Soak in lye/lime water (nixtamalization)
   - Removes hull, improves nutrition (niacin availability)
   - Grind to masa for tortillas
3. **Cracked corn:** Coarse grind for grits, polenta

**Yield:** 1 lb corn → ~3 cups cornmeal

## Ancient Grains (Alternatives)

### Quinoa

**Processing:**
1. **Thresh:** Rub seed heads through hands (easy)
2. **Winnow:** Standard method
3. **Saponin removal (critical):** Rinse in water 3-5 times until no foam
   - Saponins = bitter coating (toxic in quantity)
4. **No milling needed:** Cook whole (like rice)

**Advantage:** Complete protein, gluten-free, hardy

### Amaranth

**Processing:**
1. **Thresh:** Beat seed heads over container (tiny seeds)
2. **Winnow:** Careful (seeds very light)
3. **No milling needed:** Cook whole or pop like popcorn

**Advantage:** High protein, drought-tolerant, edible greens

### Buckwheat

**Processing:**
1. **Thresh:** Easy - seeds separate from hulls readily
2. **Winnow:** Standard
3. **De-hull:** Rub between hands or light pounding
4. **Mill or cook whole:** Buckwheat groats (kasha) or flour

**Advantage:** Fast-growing (60-90 days), cold-tolerant, gluten-free

## Flour Storage

**Whole Grain (Unmilled):**
- **Duration:** 10+ years (properly stored)
- **Conditions:** Cool (50-60°F), dry (<10% moisture), dark, airtight
- **Containers:** Food-grade buckets, mylar bags + oxygen absorbers

**Freshly Milled Flour:**
- **Duration:** 6-12 months (refrigerated/frozen)
- **Duration:** 1-3 months (room temp)
- **Reason:** Oils in bran go rancid (whole grain flour)
- **White flour:** 12+ months (less oil)

**Best Practice:** Store whole grain, mill as needed (maximum nutrition and shelf life)

**Containers:**
- Glass jars (small amounts)
- Mylar bags + oxygen absorbers (long-term)
- Food-grade buckets with gasket lids (bulk)

**Signs of Spoilage:**
- Rancid smell (oily, off)
- Bitter taste
- Mold (discard immediately)
- Insect infestation (discard)

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Threshing damp grain | Dry completely (12% moisture or less) |
| Winnowing indoors (no wind) | Use fan or wait for windy day |
| Milling too fast (overheating) | Slow, steady pace (stones barely warm) |
| Storing flour long-term | Store whole grain, mill as needed |
| Using treated wood/surfaces | Food-grade materials only |
| No cleaning between batches | Clean thoroughly (prevent contamination) |
| Grinding once for fine flour | Multiple passes (coarse → medium → fine) |

## Safety Warnings

**⚠️ Ergot (Rye/Wheat):**
- Purple/black kernels = ergot fungus (TOXIC)
- Causes convulsions, gangrene, death
- **Action:** Inspect carefully, discard ANY suspect kernels

**⚠️ Dust Explosion Risk:**
- Flour dust is explosive in enclosed spaces
- Mill outdoors or in well-ventilated area
- No open flames nearby
- Keep dust levels low

**⚠️ Repetitive Strain:**
- Hand-cranking for hours = wrist/elbow injury
- Take breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Alternate hands
- Use pedal power if available

**⚠️ Contamination:**
- Clean tools between grain types (allergen risk)
- Rodent/insect droppings in grain = disease risk
- When in doubt, throw it out
