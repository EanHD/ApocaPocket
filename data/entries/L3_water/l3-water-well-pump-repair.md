# Well Pump Repair & Troubleshooting

## Overview
Reliable pumping depends on seals, valves, priming, and routine maintenance.

## Common Failure Modes
- No suction (air leaks, dry prime, failed foot/check valve)
- Weak flow (worn seals, clogged intake, partial blockage)
- Intermittent flow (loose fittings, damaged rod linkage)

## Basic Diagnostic Sequence
1. Confirm water level is within pump capability.
2. Check all fittings for air leaks.
3. Prime system properly.
4. Inspect valve function.
5. Inspect piston cup/seal wear.

## Priming Protocol
- Fill pump body with clean water.
- Operate strokes steadily for 1–3 minutes.
- Re-prime if suction fails.

## Seal and Valve Maintenance
- Replace cracked leather/rubber cups.
- Clean debris from check valves.
- Ensure directional valve seating is correct.

## Practical Limits
- Suction-only systems have depth limits; deep wells require different designs.
- Keep spare seals, gaskets, and valve elements in stock.

## Preventive Maintenance Schedule
- Weekly: visual inspection, unusual noise/leaks.
- Monthly: fastener tightening, lubrication where appropriate.
- Quarterly: performance test (flow rate/time).

## Common Mistakes
- Running dry repeatedly.
- Ignoring minor leaks (air leak = no lift).
- Improvised parts without fit testing.

## Summary
Most pump failures are serviceable with methodical diagnostics, proper priming, and spare seal/valve parts.
