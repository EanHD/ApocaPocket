summary: How to find, identify, and assess flint and chert suitable for knapping into
  tools and fire-starting.
steps:
- Look in limestone formations, river gravels, and chalk deposits.
- Identify by waxy/glassy luster, conchoidal (shell-like) fracture, and fine grain.
- 'Color varies: gray, brown, black, tan—color is less important than fracture quality.'
- Test by striking with a harder rock—good flint produces sharp flakes and sparks
  with steel.
- Avoid material with fossils, inclusions, or internal cracks—these cause unpredictable
  fracture.
- Heat-treating (slow baking in coals, then slow cooling) can improve flaking quality.
warnings:
- Knapping produces razor-sharp flakes—wear eye protection and leather leg cover.
- Silica dust from knapping is hazardous—work outdoors with ventilation.

## Overview
How to find, identify, and assess flint and chert suitable for knapping into tools and fire-starting.

## Step-by-step
1. Look in limestone formations, river gravels, and chalk deposits.
2. Identify by waxy/glassy luster, conchoidal (shell-like) fracture, and fine grain.
3. Color varies: gray, brown, black, tan—color is less important than fracture quality.
4. Test by striking with a harder rock—good flint produces sharp flakes and sparks with steel.
5. Avoid material with fossils, inclusions, or internal cracks—these cause unpredictable fracture.
6. Heat-treating (slow baking in coals, then slow cooling) can improve flaking quality.

## Warnings
- Knapping produces razor-sharp flakes—wear eye protection and leather leg cover.
- Silica dust from knapping is hazardous—work outdoors with ventilation.
