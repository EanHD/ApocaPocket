summary: Methods for drying and curing wood to reduce moisture content for construction
  and fuel use.
steps:
- Assess green wood moisture content by weight or cracking indicators.
- Split wood to increase surface area for faster drying.
- Stack in criss-cross pattern (stickered) with airflow gaps, elevated off ground.
- Cover top to shed rain while leaving sides open for ventilation.
- Air-dry hardwoods 6–12 months, softwoods 3–6 months depending on thickness.
- 'Test readiness: seasoned wood is lighter, sounds hollow when struck, has end-grain
  cracks.'
warnings:
- Unseasoned wood burns inefficiently and produces excessive creosote.
- Kiln drying in improvised setups risks fire—monitor temperature carefully.

## Overview
Methods for drying and curing wood to reduce moisture content for construction and fuel use.

## Step-by-step
1. Assess green wood moisture content by weight or cracking indicators.
2. Split wood to increase surface area for faster drying.
3. Stack in criss-cross pattern (stickered) with airflow gaps, elevated off ground.
4. Cover top to shed rain while leaving sides open for ventilation.
5. Air-dry hardwoods 6–12 months, softwoods 3–6 months depending on thickness.
6. Test readiness: seasoned wood is lighter, sounds hollow when struck, has end-grain cracks.

## Warnings
- Unseasoned wood burns inefficiently and produces excessive creosote.
- Kiln drying in improvised setups risks fire—monitor temperature carefully.
