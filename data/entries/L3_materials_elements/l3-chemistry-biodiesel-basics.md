summary: Transesterification converts vegetable oil into biodiesel that runs in diesel engines. Requires methanol, lye, and a settling period. 10 gallons of oil yields ~9 gallons of biodiesel plus glycerin
  byproduct.
warnings:
- Methanol is toxic and flammable
- Lye causes severe chemical burns
- Biodiesel damages rubber — replace rubber fuel lines
- Glycerin byproduct is useful (soap making) but must be handled properly
steps:
- Heat oil to 55°C
- Mix methanol (20% by volume) with lye (0.3-0.5% by weight)
- Combine and stir vigorously for 60 minutes
- Let settle 8-12 hours — glycerin sinks, biodiesel floats
- Drain glycerin from bottom
- Wash biodiesel with water to remove residual impurities
- Dry and filter
- Use in any diesel engine without modification (B100) or blend with petroleum diesel
