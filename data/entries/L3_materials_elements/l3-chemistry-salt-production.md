summary: Methods for producing salt at scale through solar evaporation, boiling brine,
  and mining surface deposits.
steps:
- 'Solar evaporation: create shallow clay-lined pans, fill with seawater or brine,
  let sun evaporate.'
- 'Boiling: heat brine in wide metal or clay pans over sustained fire until crystals
  form.'
- Scrape salt crystals, re-dissolve in clean water, filter through cloth, re-crystallize
  for purity.
- 'Rock salt: mine visible salt deposits, crush, dissolve, filter, and recrystallize.'
- 'Salt from inland plants: burn salt-tolerant plants, leach ash with water, evaporate
  to recover salt.'
- Store in dry, sealed containers. Salt is essential for food preservation, leather
  tanning, and health.
warnings:
- Boiling brine produces hot steam and splashing—use eye protection and caution.
- Concentrated brine is corrosive to metal containers—use clay, glass, or stainless steel when possible.

## Overview
Methods for producing salt at scale through solar evaporation, boiling brine, and mining surface deposits.

## Step-by-step
1. Solar evaporation: create shallow clay-lined pans, fill with seawater or brine, let sun evaporate.
2. Boiling: heat brine in wide metal or clay pans over sustained fire until crystals form.
3. Scrape salt crystals, re-dissolve in clean water, filter through cloth, re-crystallize for purity.
4. Rock salt: mine visible salt deposits, crush, dissolve, filter, and recrystallize.
5. Salt from inland plants: burn salt-tolerant plants, leach ash with water, evaporate to recover salt.
6. Store in dry, sealed containers. Salt is essential for food preservation, leather tanning, and health.

## Warnings
- Boiling brine produces hot steam and splashing—use eye protection and caution.
- Concentrated brine is corrosive to metal containers—use clay, glass, or stainless steel when possible.
