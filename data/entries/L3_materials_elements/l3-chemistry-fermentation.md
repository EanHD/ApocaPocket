summary: Basic fermentation science for producing alcohol (ethanol) and vinegar (acetic
  acid) from sugars.
steps:
- 'Source sugars: fruit juice, honey-water (mead), grain mash (beer), or sugar-water.'
- 'Wild yeast: expose sugar solution to air for 24h or add unwashed fruit skins.'
- Seal in container with airlock (water trap) to allow CO₂ out but prevent oxygen
  entry.
- Ferment at 18–24°C for 1–4 weeks until bubbling stops.
- 'For vinegar: expose finished alcohol to air—acetobacter bacteria convert ethanol
  to acetic acid over weeks.'
- Test vinegar by taste (sour) and smell; ~4–5% acidity is usable for preservation.
warnings:
- Methanol (toxic) can form in improperly distilled spirits—fermented beverages are
  safe, distilled ones require care.
- Contamination with harmful bacteria is possible—maintain cleanliness and proper
  acidity.

## Overview
Basic fermentation science for producing alcohol (ethanol) and vinegar (acetic acid) from sugars.

## Step-by-step
1. Source sugars: fruit juice, honey-water (mead), grain mash (beer), or sugar-water.
2. Wild yeast: expose sugar solution to air for 24h or add unwashed fruit skins.
3. Seal in container with airlock (water trap) to allow CO₂ out but prevent oxygen entry.
4. Ferment at 18–24°C for 1–4 weeks until bubbling stops.
5. For vinegar: expose finished alcohol to air—acetobacter bacteria convert ethanol to acetic acid over weeks.
6. Test vinegar by taste (sour) and smell; ~4–5% acidity is usable for preservation.

## Warnings
- Methanol (toxic) can form in improperly distilled spirits—fermented beverages are safe, distilled ones require care.
- Contamination with harmful bacteria is possible—maintain cleanliness and proper acidity.
