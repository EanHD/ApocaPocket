summary: Ethanol distillation concentrates fermented sugars into high-proof alcohol for use as wound antiseptic (60-90% concentration), fuel, solvent, and preservative. A simple pot still can be built from
  scavenged materials.
warnings:
- Distilling alcohol is ILLEGAL in many jurisdictions without a permit — survival use only
- METHANOL (wood alcohol) is a deadly byproduct — the first 50ml from any distillation run (foreshots) MUST be discarded. Methanol causes blindness and death.
- Ethanol vapor is EXTREMELY flammable — distill OUTDOORS, away from open flames at the collection point
- Never seal a still completely — pressure buildup causes explosion. Steam must always have an exit path.
- Do not use lead solder, galvanized metal, or car radiators for condensers — lead and zinc poisoning
steps:
- 'FERMENTATION FIRST: you need a ''wash'' (fermented liquid) of 8-14% alcohol. Simplest: dissolve sugar (2 lbs per gallon water), add yeast, ferment 5-14 days. Or: mash fruit, corn, grain, honey, or any
  sugar source. See fermentation entry.'
- 'SIMPLE POT STILL: large pot with a lid (or sealed with clay/dough around the rim). Copper or stainless steel tube (3/8 to 1/2 inch) exits from the lid, coils downward through a bucket of cold water (condenser),
  and drips into a collection container. This is the most basic design.'
- 'HEAT MANAGEMENT: heat the wash to 173°F (78.3°C) — this is ethanol''s boiling point. Water boils at 212°F (100°C). The goal is to evaporate ethanol while leaving most water behind. Use GENTLE heat —
  a hard boil produces too much steam and water vapor.'
- 'THE CUTS — CRITICAL SAFETY STEP: FORESHOTS (first 50ml per 5 gallons of wash): DISCARD. Contains methanol and other toxic volatiles. HEADS (next 200ml): harsh, solvent-like. Discard or save for cleaning/fuel
  only. HEARTS (main run): clean-tasting ethanol. Collect this — it''s the good stuff. TAILS (when liquid starts tasting watery/oily): stop collecting.'
- 'PROOF TESTING: shake a small jar of distillate vigorously. If bubbles disappear quickly: high proof (>50%). If bubbles linger: lower proof. More precise: float a hydrometer if available. For antiseptic
  use, you need 60-90% (120-180 proof). First run typically produces 40-65% — redistill for higher concentration.'
- 'SECOND DISTILLATION: for higher proof (needed for antiseptic), redistill the hearts. Second pass through the still increases concentration to 70-85%. Add water back if too strong for desired use.'
- 'ANTISEPTIC USE: 60-90% ethanol kills most bacteria on wound surfaces. Apply liberally to clean wounds. Let air dry. At 60%, it''s also effective for sanitizing tools and surfaces. Below 50% or above
  90%, antiseptic effectiveness drops sharply.'
- 'FUEL USE: ethanol above 80% burns cleanly in alcohol stoves (empty can with ventilation holes). Can be mixed with gasoline (up to 10%) in gasoline engines without modification. Pure ethanol requires
  engine modifications for use as sole fuel.'
- 'YIELD: 5 gallons of 10% wash produces approximately 1/2 gallon of 40-50% ethanol (first run). Redistilling produces ~1 quart of 70-80% ethanol. Fruit wines and honey mead tend to produce cleaner distillate
  than grain mashes.'
- 'IMPROVISED STILL FROM SCAVENGED MATERIALS: pressure cooker (pot), copper brake line from a vehicle (condenser coil), automotive hose (connections), bucket of cold water (condenser bath). Seal joints
  with flour-water paste or clay. Replace condenser water frequently to keep it cold.'

# Ethanol Distillation — Fuel and Antiseptic

Ethanol distillation concentrates fermented sugars into high-proof alcohol for use as wound antiseptic (60-90% concentration), fuel, solvent, and preservative. A simple pot still can be built from scavenged materials.
