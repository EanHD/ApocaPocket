summary: Field indicators for identifying iron, copper, and tin ore deposits without
  laboratory equipment.
steps:
- 'Iron: look for red-brown staining on rocks and soil (rust/hematite), heavy dark
  rocks with metallic luster.'
- 'Iron bog ore: reddish-orange deposits in swampy/marshy areas where iron precipitates
  from groundwater.'
- 'Copper: green/blue staining (malachite, azurite) on rock surfaces indicates copper
  mineralization.'
- 'Tin (cassiterite): heavy black/brown crystals in stream gravels, very high specific
  gravity.'
- 'Use streak test on unglazed porcelain: hematite streaks red-brown, magnetite streaks
  black.'
- Test magnetism with any iron/steel object—magnetite is strongly magnetic.
warnings:
- Some ore minerals contain toxic elements (arsenic, lead)—wash hands after handling.
- Mining and smelting operations require proper ventilation.

## Overview
Field indicators for identifying iron, copper, and tin ore deposits without laboratory equipment.

## Step-by-step
1. Iron: look for red-brown staining on rocks and soil (rust/hematite), heavy dark rocks with metallic luster.
2. Iron bog ore: reddish-orange deposits in swampy/marshy areas where iron precipitates from groundwater.
3. Copper: green/blue staining (malachite, azurite) on rock surfaces indicates copper mineralization.
4. Tin (cassiterite): heavy black/brown crystals in stream gravels, very high specific gravity.
5. Use streak test on unglazed porcelain: hematite streaks red-brown, magnetite streaks black.
6. Test magnetism with any iron/steel object—magnetite is strongly magnetic.

## Warnings
- Some ore minerals contain toxic elements (arsenic, lead)—wash hands after handling.
- Mining and smelting operations require proper ventilation.
