summary: Natural and improvised methods to prevent wood rot, insect damage, and decay.
steps:
- Keep wood dry—moisture below 20% prevents most fungal rot.
- Elevate wood structures off ground contact using stone or concrete footings.
- Char the surface of ground-contact posts (shou sugi ban / yakisugi technique).
- Apply natural oils (linseed, tung) to seal surfaces against moisture.
- 'Use naturally rot-resistant species: cedar, black locust, white oak, osage orange.'
- Ensure good ventilation around wood structures to prevent moisture accumulation.
warnings:
- Chemical wood preservatives (CCA, creosote) are toxic—avoid for food contact surfaces.
- Burning surfaces requires careful fire control.
