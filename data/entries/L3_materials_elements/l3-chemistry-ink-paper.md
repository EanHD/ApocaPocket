summary: Writing materials made from local plants and minerals. Oak-gall ink (iron gall ink) is permanent and water-resistant. Paper from plant fiber pulp takes 1-2 days including drying.
warnings:
- Oak-gall ink is mildly corrosive to metal nibs — use quill or reed pens
- Fresh ink stains skin and fabric — work carefully
- Paper-making uses large amounts of water — do near a water source
- Lye used in pulp processing is caustic
steps:
- 'OAK-GALL INK: collect oak galls (round growths on oak trees caused by wasps). Crush 10-12 galls, soak in 1 cup water for 2-3 days. Strain. Add rusty iron nails and let sit 1 week — iron reacts with tannic
  acid forming black ink. Add gum arabic (tree sap) as binder. Stores indefinitely.'
- 'CHARCOAL INK: grind charcoal to fine powder. Mix with water and gum arabic or hide glue. Less permanent than iron-gall but immediate.'
- 'PAPER PULP: soak plant fiber (cotton rags, linen, hemp, kozo bark, papyrus) in lye solution (wood ash water) for 24 hours. This breaks down lignin. Rinse thoroughly.'
- 'Beat fiber: pound with a mallet or process in water until it becomes a slurry of individual fibers. This takes 1-2 hours of hard work.'
- 'FORMING SHEETS: dilute pulp in a large tub of water (1 part pulp:20 parts water). Dip a frame with fine screen/cloth into the tub, lift horizontally, capturing a thin layer of fibers. Let drain.'
- Press between cloths and boards to remove water. Hang or lay flat to dry completely (24 hours). The result is rough handmade paper suitable for writing.
- 'ALTERNATIVE - PAPYRUS: slice papyrus stems lengthwise into thin strips. Lay parallel, slightly overlapping. Lay a second layer perpendicular on top. Pound with mallet and press under weight for 24 hours.
  Dries into a writing surface.'
