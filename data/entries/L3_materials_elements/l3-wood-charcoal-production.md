summary: Pit and kiln methods for converting wood to charcoal through oxygen-limited
  pyrolysis.
steps:
- Select dense hardwood; cut into uniform pieces 5–15 cm diameter.
- 'Pit method: dig a pit ~1m deep, load wood, light top, cover with earth leaving
  small vents.'
- 'Mound method: stack wood in a dome, cover with leaves then earth, light from top
  center.'
- Control airflow through vents—smoke should transition from white (steam) to blue
  (pyrolysis).
- When blue smoke stops, seal all vents completely and let cool 24–48 hours.
- Break open carefully; good charcoal is black throughout, rings when struck, and
  is very light.
warnings:
- Carbon monoxide is produced—never operate in enclosed spaces.
- Hot charcoal can reignite when exposed to air during opening.
- Fire spread risk—clear surrounding vegetation and have water/dirt available.

## Overview
Pit and kiln methods for converting wood to charcoal through oxygen-limited pyrolysis.

## Step-by-step
1. Select dense hardwood; cut into uniform pieces 5–15 cm diameter.
2. Pit method: dig a pit ~1m deep, load wood, light top, cover with earth leaving small vents.
3. Mound method: stack wood in a dome, cover with leaves then earth, light from top center.
4. Control airflow through vents—smoke should transition from white (steam) to blue (pyrolysis).
5. When blue smoke stops, seal all vents completely and let cool 24–48 hours.
6. Break open carefully; good charcoal is black throughout, rings when struck, and is very light.

## Warnings
- Carbon monoxide is produced—never operate in enclosed spaces.
- Hot charcoal can reignite when exposed to air during opening.
- Fire spread risk—clear surrounding vegetation and have water/dirt available.
