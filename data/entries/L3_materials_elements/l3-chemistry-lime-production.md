summary: Producing quicklime (CaO) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)₂) from limestone for mortar,
  plaster, and sanitation.
steps:
- Gather limestone or seashells (both are calcium carbonate).
- 'Build a lime kiln: stack limestone over a fire chamber that can sustain 900°C+
  for hours.'
- Burn for 12–24 hours until stones become white, lighter, and crumbly—this is quicklime
  (CaO).
- 'Slaking: carefully add water to quicklime—it heats violently and produces calcium
  hydroxide paste.'
- Lime putty (aged slaked lime) makes superior mortar and plaster.
- Mix with sand (~1:3 ratio) for mortar; use thin coats for plaster/whitewash.
warnings:
- Quicklime reacts violently with water—extreme heat, steam, and caustic splashing.
- Both quicklime and slaked lime cause severe burns—full skin and eye protection required.
- Lime kiln operation requires sustained high temperatures—significant fire risk.

## Overview
Producing quicklime (CaO) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)₂) from limestone for mortar, plaster, and sanitation.

## Step-by-step
1. Gather limestone or seashells (both are calcium carbonate).
2. Build a lime kiln: stack limestone over a fire chamber that can sustain 900°C+ for hours.
3. Burn for 12–24 hours until stones become white, lighter, and crumbly—this is quicklime (CaO).
4. Slaking: carefully add water to quicklime—it heats violently and produces calcium hydroxide paste.
5. Lime putty (aged slaked lime) makes superior mortar and plaster.
6. Mix with sand (~1:3 ratio) for mortar; use thin coats for plaster/whitewash.

## Warnings
- Quicklime reacts violently with water—extreme heat, steam, and caustic splashing.
- Both quicklime and slaked lime cause severe burns—full skin and eye protection required.
- Lime kiln operation requires sustained high temperatures—significant fire risk.
