summary: Methods for locating and extracting salt from natural deposits, seawater,
  and brine springs.
steps:
- 'Coastal: collect seawater in shallow pans, allow solar evaporation over days.'
- 'Inland: locate salt licks (areas where animals gather), brine springs, or surface
  salt deposits.'
- Boil brine in wide, shallow containers to accelerate evaporation.
- Scrape crystallized salt and re-dissolve in clean water to purify, then re-evaporate.
- 'Plant indicator: salt-tolerant plants (glasswort, sea lavender) indicate saline
  soils.'
- Store salt dry in sealed containers—salt absorbs moisture readily.

## Overview
Methods for locating and extracting salt from natural deposits, seawater, and brine springs.

## Step-by-step
1. Coastal: collect seawater in shallow pans, allow solar evaporation over days.
2. Inland: locate salt licks (areas where animals gather), brine springs, or surface salt deposits.
3. Boil brine in wide, shallow containers to accelerate evaporation.
4. Scrape crystallized salt and re-dissolve in clean water to purify, then re-evaporate.
5. Plant indicator: salt-tolerant plants (glasswort, sea lavender) indicate saline soils.
6. Store salt dry in sealed containers—salt absorbs moisture readily.
