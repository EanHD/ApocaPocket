summary: Glass is melted silica (sand) + flux (soda ash or potash) + stabilizer (lime). Requires 1400-1600°C sustained temperature. Primitive glass (bottle green, full of bubbles) is achievable with a forced-air
  furnace and local materials.
warnings:
- Glass melting requires extreme temperatures — severe burn risk
- Silica dust (from grinding sand) causes silicosis — work wet or wear mask
- Molten glass looks identical to solid glass — assume everything near the furnace is dangerously hot
- Early attempts produce brittle, bubbly, colored glass — functional but not optical quality
steps:
- 'MATERIALS: clean silica sand (white beach sand or crushed quartz), soda ash or potash (from wood ash — see lye entry), and lime (from limestone). Ratio: 70% sand, 15% flux, 15% lime by weight.'
- 'Build a high-temperature furnace: clay-lined pit with forced air (bellows or blower). Charcoal fuel. Target temperature: 1400°C+. A pottery kiln capable of stoneware temperatures can work.'
- Mix ingredients thoroughly when DRY. Place in a crucible (clay pot rated for high heat).
- Heat gradually over 2-4 hours to avoid thermal shock cracking the crucible. Maintain peak temperature for 1-2 hours until mixture is completely molten and homogeneous.
- Pour into molds or roll on a flat surface (marver). Work quickly — glass stiffens as it cools.
- Anneal (slow cool) over 12-24 hours to prevent stress cracks. Rapid cooling shatters glass.
- Expect green tint (from iron impurities in sand) and bubbles (dissolved gases). Refined glass requires purer ingredients and skilled technique.
- 'USES: bottles, jars, windows (cast and ground flat), beads, tools for working other materials'

# Basic Glass Making from Sand

Glass is melted silica (sand) + flux (soda ash or potash) + stabilizer (lime). Requires 1400-1600°C sustained temperature. Primitive glass (bottle green, full of bubbles) is achievable with a forced-air furnace and local materials.
