summary: Candles provide reliable light without electricity. Tallow (rendered animal fat) is the most available material; beeswax produces superior candles. A single tallow candle burns 4-6 hours and provides
  enough light to read by.
warnings:
- Hot rendered fat causes severe burns — handle with extreme care, especially around children
- Tallow candles produce smoke and odor — ensure ventilation
- Never leave candles unattended — fire risk is significant, especially in improvised shelters
- Rendering fat produces strong odors — do it outdoors
steps:
- 'RENDERING TALLOW: cut animal fat (beef, deer, sheep — kidney/suet fat is best) into small cubes or grind. Add to pot with ½ cup water per pound of fat. Heat on LOW — never boil. Stir occasionally for
  2-4 hours until all solid pieces have liquefied or become crispy.'
- Strain through cloth into a clean container. Let cool and solidify. Scrape off any brown/meat residue from the bottom. For cleaner candles, remelt and strain again. Triple-rendered tallow is white and
  nearly odorless.
- 'WICKS: twist cotton string/thread tightly (3 strands twisted together). For better burn, soak wick in solution of 1 tablespoon salt + 2 tablespoons borax per cup of water, then dry. This makes the wick
  self-trimming and reduces smoking.'
- 'DIP CANDLES: melt tallow to 60-70°C. Tie wick to a stick. Dip wick into tallow, lift out, let cool 30 seconds. Repeat 20-40 times, building up layers. Each dip adds ~1mm thickness. A ¾-inch candle takes
  about 25-30 dips.'
- 'MOLD CANDLES: pour melted tallow into any cylindrical mold (tin can, bamboo tube, PVC pipe, rolled bark). Thread wick through center — poke hole in bottom of mold, thread wick through, seal with clay/wax.
  Pour in layers, letting each partially cool to prevent sinkholes.'
- 'BEESWAX CANDLES: melt beeswax at 62-65°C (lower than tallow). Same dipping or molding process. Beeswax burns brighter, longer, and cleaner than tallow. Mix with tallow 50/50 for economy.'
- 'RUSH LIGHTS (simplest option): peel the outer skin from dry rushes/cattail stalks, leaving one strip of skin for structure. Soak the pith in melted tallow for 30 minutes. Dry. Clamp at 45° angle in a
  holder. Burns 15-30 minutes per foot of rush.'
- 'BURN TIME: tallow candle (¾ inch diameter, 6 inch tall) = 4-6 hours. Beeswax same size = 6-8 hours. One pound of tallow makes approximately 4 standard candles.'

# Tallow and Beeswax Candle Making
