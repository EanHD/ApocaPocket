## Overview
Foundational combustion chemistry for fire control, fuel efficiency, and hazard reduction.

## Step-by-step
1. Model fire triangle: fuel, oxygen, heat.
2. Adjust airflow and fuel geometry to control burn.
3. Track incomplete combustion indicators.
4. Apply extinguishing strategy by removing one fire-triangle element.

## Warnings
- Combustion byproducts include toxic gases.
- Confined spaces dramatically increase risk.
