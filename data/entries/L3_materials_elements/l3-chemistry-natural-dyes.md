summary: Extracting and fixing plant-based dyes for coloring textiles and cordage.
steps:
- 'Common dye sources: onion skins (yellow-orange), walnut hulls (brown), berries
  (purple/blue), turmeric (yellow).'
- Chop plant material, simmer in water for 1–2 hours to extract color.
- Strain out solids to get dye bath.
- 'Mordant fabric first: soak in alum solution (if available) or use tannin-rich water
  (oak bark) to help dye bind.'
- Submerge fabric in dye bath, simmer for 1–2 hours, stirring occasionally.
- Rinse in cool water, hang to dry. Colors deepen with repeated dipping.
warnings:
- Some dye plants are toxic (pokeweed)—do not ingest dye baths.
- Some mordants (chrome, tin) are toxic—alum and tannin are safest.

## Overview
Extracting and fixing plant-based dyes for coloring textiles and cordage.

## Step-by-step
1. Common dye sources: onion skins (yellow-orange), walnut hulls (brown), berries (purple/blue), turmeric (yellow).
2. Chop plant material, simmer in water for 1–2 hours to extract color.
3. Strain out solids to get dye bath.
4. Mordant fabric first: soak in alum solution (if available) or use tannin-rich water (oak bark) to help dye bind.
5. Submerge fabric in dye bath, simmer for 1–2 hours, stirring occasionally.
6. Rinse in cool water, hang to dry. Colors deepen with repeated dipping.

## Warnings
- Some dye plants are toxic (pokeweed)—do not ingest dye baths.
- Some mordants (chrome, tin) are toxic—alum and tannin are safest.
