summary: "Building and operating a simple distillation apparatus to purify water or separate liquids. Physical process exploiting different boiling points - water boils at 100°C (373K), most dissolved solids remain behind. REMOVES: 99.5%+ dissolved salts/minerals, heavy metals, pathogens (bacteria/viruses killed by boiling). DOES NOT REMOVE: volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with boiling points <100°C (benzene BP 80°C, chloroform BP 61°C). Efficiency: 0.5-1.5L/hour with active heat, 0.2-0.5L/day solar still."
audit_status: "verified steps:"
- 'ACTIVE DISTILLATION SETUP: "(1) SOURCE CONTAINER: Large pot or metal container (5-20L capacity). Fill 50-75% with contaminated water (leave space for boiling). Stainless steel, copper, or glass best (avoid aluminum with very acidic/basic water—dissolves aluminum). (2) HEAT SOURCE: Fire, camp stove, or electric element. Maintain gentle boil (100-105°C)—vigorous boiling wastes fuel and reduces purity (splashing). (3) VAPOR PATHWAY: Seal lid with tube/pipe exit (copper tube 10-15mm diameter ideal, bamboo works). Exit tube at angle 10-30° downward slope for gravity drainage. SEAL: Clay, dough, wet cloth around tube-lid junction (prevents steam escape). (4) CONDENSER: Pass exit tube through cooling container (20-40L cold water bath). Tube length in cooler: minimum 300mm for efficient condensation. Add ice or replace water periodically (warm water reduces efficiency). Alternatively: coil tube in spiral (500-1000mm length) for increased surface area. (5) COLLECTION: Clean container at tube exit. Keep covered to prevent contamination. YIELD: 0.5-1.5L per hour depending on heat intensity and condenser efficiency. FUEL CONSUMPTION: 1kg wood per 2-3L distilled water (varies with wood type and fire efficiency)."
- 'IMPROVISED CONDENSER DESIGNS: "WET CLOTH METHOD: Wrap exit tube with cloth, keep wet (evaporative cooling). Efficiency 40-60% of water bath method. BURIED TUBE: Run tube through cool ground (0.5-1m deep) for 2-5m length. Works in cool climates. STREAM COOLING: Place coiled tube in flowing stream (very efficient, near 100% condensation). RADIATOR COIL: Salvaged vehicle radiator works excellently as condenser (large surface area). CAUTION: Ensure no antifreeze residue (toxic)."
- 'SOLAR STILL (PASSIVE METHOD): "(1) Dig pit 1m diameter, 0.5m deep in sunny location. (2) Place COLLECTION CONTAINER (1-2L capacity) at center bottom. (3) Spread clear PLASTIC SHEET (2m × 2m, 2-6 mil thickness) over pit. Anchor edges with soil/rocks (seal completely). (4) Place WEIGHT (fist-sized rock) at center of plastic, directly above collection container (creates cone shape, angle 20-40°). (5) Optional: Place vegetation, contaminated water in pit around container (NOT in container—increases vapor production). (6) OPERATION: Solar heat (daytime temperature 25-45°C) evaporates moisture. Vapor condenses on plastic underside (cooler than air). Droplets run down to weighted center, drip into container. YIELD: 0.2-0.8L per day depending on sunlight, temperature, humidity. PEAK PRODUCTION: 10am-4pm. IMPROVEMENT: Paint collection container black (absorbs more heat, increases evaporation rate 20-40%). Use UV-resistant plastic (standard plastic degrades in 2-6 months)."
- 'TEMPERATURE AND PURITY: "Water boils at 100°C (sea level), 95°C (1500m altitude), 90°C (3000m altitude). DISTILLATION REMOVES: Dissolved minerals (calcium, magnesium, sodium salts >99.5% removal), Heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic >99%), Pathogens (bacteria, viruses, protozoa—100% killed by boiling before distillation), Radioactive fallout particles (>99% removal), Non-volatile chemicals (>95% removal). DOES NOT REMOVE: Volatile organic compounds with BP <100°C (gasoline, benzene, alcohols, some pesticides), Gases (chlorine, radon—may actually concentrate). RESULT pH: 5.5-7.0 (slightly acidic from dissolved CO2, neutral if sealed while hot)."
- 'FRACTION COLLECTION: "FIRST FRACTION (heads): Discard first 50-100ml per 10L batch. Contains concentrated VOCs, initial impurities, dissolved gases. Often cloudy or odorous. MIDDLE FRACTION (hearts): Main collection. Clear, odorless, pure water. Collect until source nearly empty. LAST FRACTION (tails): Discard final 200-500ml per 10L batch. Contains concentrated non-volatile impurities, may have residual taste/color from source. TOTAL WASTE: Discard 10-20% of source volume (first and last portions) for maximum purity."
- 'DISTILLATE TESTING: "CONDUCTIVITY: Pure distilled water has very low conductivity (<10 μS/cm). Tap water 200-800 μS/cm, sea water 50,000 μS/cm. Use conductivity meter or simple LED test (distilled water barely lights LED in series circuit). TASTE: Should be flat/neutral (lacks minerals). Slight plastic/metal taste from apparatus acceptable, strong chemical taste = contamination, redistill or discard. PH: Should be 5.5-7.0. pH <5 or >8 indicates contamination. CLARITY: Should be crystal clear. Cloudiness = contamination or incomplete condensation."
- 'REMINERALIZATION: "Distilled water lacks minerals (calcium, magnesium). Safe to drink short-term, but long-term consumption may leach minerals from body. ADD MINERALS: (1) Pinch of sea salt per liter (adds sodium, trace minerals). (2) Crush limestone/eggshells to powder, add 1-2g per liter, shake, let settle (adds calcium). (3) Steep in copper vessel (adds copper, trace amounts). (4) Mix 10-20% spring/well water with distilled. TARGET: 50-150 mg/L total dissolved solids for optimal health and taste."
- 'STORAGE:
- "Store distilled water in GLASS or FOOD-GRADE PLASTIC (HDPE, PETE). Avoid prolonged storage in metal (leaches trace metals). Keep sealed (absorbs CO2 from air, becomes slightly acidic over weeks—harmless but affects taste). SHELF LIFE: Sealed distilled water lasts indefinitely. Opened water: 6-12 months (absorbs odors, CO2). If stored >6 months, taste before use (should be neutral). Off taste = discard or redistill.' warnings:"
- Distillation may not remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with boiling points <100°C (benzene 80°C, chloroform 61°C, acetone 56°C, methanol 65°C, gasoline 40-200°C). If water contaminated with chemicals/fuel, use activated carbon filtration AFTER distillation, or use alternative purification method
- Steam at 100°C causes SEVERE BURNS on contact. SKIN CONTACT:
- "Immediately flood with cold water for 15-20 minutes. BLISTER TREATMENT: Do not pop blisters. Cover with sterile dressing. Seek medical attention for burns >5cm diameter or on face/hands. STEAM IS INVISIBLE: Be extremely cautious when opening distillation apparatus—escaping steam can burn face/eyes"
- NEVER distill alcohol in enclosed spaces without proper ventilation. Ethanol vapor (flammable, explosive at 3-19% concentration in air) can accumulate. Distilling alcohol requires different safety protocols (see ethanol distillation entry). Using distillation apparatus near open flames with alcohol vapors = EXPLOSION RISK
- Distilling seawater concentrates salt in source container. At >26% salt concentration (saturation), scale forms on heating surfaces (reduces efficiency, can crack metal). CLEAN between batches—scrub salt deposits with vinegar or citric acid solution
- DO NOT DRINK hot distillate directly from condenser. Let cool to <50°C (can scald mouth/throat). Also: hot water absorbs more CO2 becoming more acidic
- Glass containers can shatter from thermal shock. If using glass:
- heat gradually, cool gradually. Thick borosilicate glass best (Pyrex-type). Regular glass may crack
- Pressure buildup if seals too tight without vent = EXPLOSION. Always include small vent hole (2-3mm) or loose-fitting seal to prevent pressure buildup. Sealed distillation under pressure requires different equipment
- "Source water with high nitrate content (>10 mg/L) concentrates nitrates in first fraction. Discard first 200-300ml per 10L batch. Nitrates cause methemoglobinemia (blue baby syndrome) if concentrated related_entries:"
