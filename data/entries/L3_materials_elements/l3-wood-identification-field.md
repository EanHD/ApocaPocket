summary: Field methods for identifying wood species by bark, leaf, grain, and growth
  characteristics.
steps:
- 'Examine bark texture: smooth, furrowed, plated, or peeling.'
- 'Check leaf shape: needle vs broadleaf, simple vs compound, alternate vs opposite.'
- Cut a cross-section to observe growth rings, heartwood color, and grain pattern.
- Smell fresh-cut wood—many species have distinctive odors (cedar, pine, walnut).
- Test hardness by pressing a thumbnail into end grain.
- Cross-reference bark + leaf + grain to narrow species identification.

## Overview
Field methods for identifying wood species by bark, leaf, grain, and growth characteristics.

## Step-by-step
1. Examine bark texture: smooth, furrowed, plated, or peeling.
2. Check leaf shape: needle vs broadleaf, simple vs compound, alternate vs opposite.
3. Cut a cross-section to observe growth rings, heartwood color, and grain pattern.
4. Smell fresh-cut wood—many species have distinctive odors (cedar, pine, walnut).
5. Test hardness by pressing a thumbnail into end grain.
6. Cross-reference bark + leaf + grain to narrow species identification.
