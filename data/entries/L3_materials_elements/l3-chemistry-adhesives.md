summary: Producing natural adhesives from animal hides, tree resins, and plant materials.
steps:
- 'Pine pitch glue: collect resin from conifer wounds, melt gently, mix with crushed
  charcoal (~30%) and plant fiber.'
- 'Hide glue: simmer rawhide scraps or sinew in water for hours until liquid becomes
  syrupy.'
- 'Birch bark tar: heat birch bark in sealed container (no oxygen) to extract dark,
  sticky tar.'
- Apply adhesives warm—most natural glues set as they cool and dry.
- Pine pitch is waterproof; hide glue is stronger but water-soluble.
- Store hide glue dried; reconstitute by soaking in warm water.
warnings:
- Heating resin produces flammable vapors—use small fires, avoid open flames directly
  over resin.
- Birch tar extraction requires controlled pyrolysis—fire risk.

## Overview
Producing natural adhesives from animal hides, tree resins, and plant materials.

## Step-by-step
1. Pine pitch glue: collect resin from conifer wounds, melt gently, mix with crushed charcoal (~30%) and plant fiber.
2. Hide glue: simmer rawhide scraps or sinew in water for hours until liquid becomes syrupy.
3. Birch bark tar: heat birch bark in sealed container (no oxygen) to extract dark, sticky tar.
4. Apply adhesives warm—most natural glues set as they cool and dry.
5. Pine pitch is waterproof; hide glue is stronger but water-soluble.
6. Store hide glue dried; reconstitute by soaking in warm water.

## Warnings
- Heating resin produces flammable vapors—use small fires, avoid open flames directly over resin.
- Birch tar extraction requires controlled pyrolysis—fire risk.
