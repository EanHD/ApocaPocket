## Overview
Basic field tests for identifying workable clay deposits.

## Step-by-step
1. Collect subsoil sample away from organic top layer.
2. Perform ribbon/plasticity tests with water.
3. Settle slurry to estimate silt/sand proportion.
4. Test small fired sample for shrinkage/cracking.

## Warnings
- Natural clays may contain contaminants.
- Firing requires controlled ventilation and heat management.
