summary: Producing soap by combining wood ash lye (potassium hydroxide KOH) with rendered animal fat or plant oils through saponification reaction. Chemical equation - Fat (triglyceride) + 3KOH → Glycerol + 3 Soap (potassium salt of fatty acid). Requires 6-8 weeks for full saponification and pH reduction from 13-14 to safe 9-10.
audit_status: "verified steps:"
- 'LYE PRODUCTION: "Use HARDWOOD ASH only (oak, maple, beech—high mineral content 5-15% K2CO3). Softwood ash is weak (<3% K2CO3). METHOD: (1) Fill wooden barrel (not metal—lye corrodes iron/aluminum) with clean dry ash. (2) Pour rainwater or distilled water through slowly (ratio 3:1 water to ash by volume). (3) Collect brown liquid dripping from bottom (potash lye, mainly KOH potassium hydroxide). (4) Boil down to concentrate if needed (increases density from 1.05 to 1.2-1.3 g/ml). YIELD: 10 liters water through 5 liters ash produces ~5 liters weak lye (pH 12-13). Concentration: 2-6% KOH by weight."
- 'LYE STRENGTH TESTING: "CRITICAL FOR SAFETY AND SOAP QUALITY. (1) FEATHER TEST: Chicken feather dissolves in 2-4 hours in strong lye (pH 13+, 5-8% KOH). No dissolving in 8 hours = too weak, boil to concentrate. (2) EGG TEST: Fresh egg floats with area size of quarter (5cm diameter) exposed above surface = correct strength. Sinks = too weak. Floats high (>8cm exposed) = too strong, dilute. (3) POTATO TEST: Raw potato slice floats 50-75% submerged = correct. Fully submerged = too weak. (4) PH PAPER: Strong lye = pH 13-14. Weak = pH 11-12 (needs concentration). TARGET: pH 13-13.5 for soap making (4-6% KOH). (5) DENSITY: Use hydrometer. Target 1.20-1.25 g/ml (equivalent to 30-35° Baumé)."
- 'FAT RENDERING: "BEEF TALLOW: Best for hard soap (melting point 40-50°C, high saturated fat). PORK LARD: Softer soap (MP 36-40°C, more unsaturated). SHEEP: Very hard soap (MP 45-55°C). PLANT OILS: Olive, coconut produce softer soaps (liquid potassium soaps). METHOD: (1) Chop fat into 2-5cm pieces. (2) Heat slowly 80-100°C with equal volume water in pot (prevents scorching). (3) Simmer 2-4 hours, stirring occasionally. (4) Strain through cloth to remove cracklings (fried tissue bits—save for eating). (5) Cool in wide pan. Fat solidifies on top (tallow layer 5-20cm thick depending on quantity). (6) Lift off solid fat, scrape off bottom layer (contains impurities). (7) Re-melt if very dirty, add water, cool again. YIELD: 10kg raw fat produces 6-7kg rendered tallow. STORE: Cool dark place, lasts 6-12 months. Rancid fat (sour smell) makes poor soap—use fresh."
- 'SAPONIFICATION PROCESS: "COLD PROCESS (traditional). (1) Measure fat: 1000g (1kg) rendered tallow. (2) Measure lye: 200-250ml strong lye (pH 13-13.5, density 1.20-1.25). RATIO: approximately 4-5 parts fat to 1 part strong lye by volume. (3) Heat fat gently to 38-43°C (body temperature, barely warm to touch). (4) SLOWLY add lye to melted fat while stirring continuously with wooden paddle (NEVER add fat to lye—causes violent spattering). Add lye in thin stream over 5-10 minutes. (5) Stir constantly for 20-60 minutes. EXOTHERMIC REACTION releases heat (temperature rises to 60-80°C). (6) TRACE: Mixture thickens to consistency of thin pudding or cream. Drizzled soap leaves visible trace pattern on surface for 2-3 seconds before sinking. (7) Add optional ingredients: salt (hardens soap, 10-20g per kg), herbs, essential oils (fragrance, 20-50ml per kg—add at trace to prevent evaporation). (8) Pour into wooden or cardboard molds lined with cloth or wax paper. Smooth surface. (9) Cover with cloth or cardboard, insulate with blankets (retains heat for complete saponification). (10) Let sit undisturbed 24-48 hours. (11) Unmold when firm but still slightly soft (like firm cheese). (12) Cut into bars with wire or knife. (13) CURE: Place on wooden rack with air circulation. Turn weekly. Cure 4-8 weeks minimum (potassium soap needs 6-8 weeks, sodium soap 4-6 weeks). During cure: pH drops from 13-14 to 9-10 (safe for skin), excess moisture evaporates (bars shrink 10-20%, harden), saponification completes (unreacted lye combines with CO2 from air forming carbonates)."
- 'HOT PROCESS (faster but more work): "(1) Prepare fat and lye as above. (2) Combine in pot, heat gently 80-100°C while stirring. (3) Maintain heat 1-3 hours, stirring every 10-15 minutes. Soap becomes translucent and gel-like when done. (4) Test by dissolving small sample in hot water—clear solution = done, cloudy = needs more cooking. (5) Add salt solution (brine 25% NaCl by weight) equal volume to soap. Stir, let sit 30 minutes. Soap rises to top, glycerol and excess lye sink to bottom. (6) Ladle off soap layer, discard bottom liquid. (7) Repeat brine washing 2-3 times for purer soap. (8) Mold and cure 1-2 weeks (much faster than cold process). ADVANTAGE: Usable sooner. DISADVANTAGE: More labor, uses more fuel."
- 'FINISHED SOAP TESTING: "(1) PH TEST: Dissolve 1g soap in 10ml distilled water. Test with pH paper. TARGET: pH 9-10 (safe for skin). pH >11 = still too alkaline, cure longer. pH <8.5 = too much fat, soap may be greasy. (2) LATHER TEST: Rub soap bar under warm water. Good soap produces rich creamy lather. Poor lather = too much fat or weak lye. (3) SKIN TEST: Wash hands with small piece. Should feel clean, not burning or excessively drying. Burning sensation = pH too high (>11), cure longer or discard. (4) ZEIN TEST (traditional): Dissolve soap in alcohol. Add to water. Clear solution = pure soap. Cloudy = excess fat or incomplete saponification."
- 'STORAGE: "Store cured soap in dry place (low humidity <60%). Lasts 1-3 years. High humidity causes soap to absorb water and become mushy. Wrap in paper or cloth (allows breathing). Plastic wrap traps moisture—avoid unless fully cured and very dry.' warnings:"
- Lye (KOH pH 13-14, NaOH pH 14) causes SEVERE CHEMICAL BURNS on contact. IMMEDIATE TREATMENT: Flush with large volume of water for 15-20 minutes. Neutralize with vinegar (acetic acid) after flushing. Seek medical attention for burns >2cm diameter or any eye exposure. PERMANENT BLINDNESS risk from eye contact
- Always wear:
- NITRILE or RUBBER GLOVES (not latex—lye degrades latex), SAFETY GOGGLES or FACE SHIELD (not just glasses—splashing risk), LONG SLEEVES and APRON (protect skin), CLOSED-TOE SHOES
- Never add water to concentrated lye—ALWAYS add lye to water/fat slowly. Adding water to lye causes violent boiling and explosive spattering (exothermic dissolution ΔH = -57 kJ/mol for KOH)
- Work OUTDOORS or with EXCELLENT VENTILATION. Lye dust and steam irritate lungs (coughing, breathing difficulty). Exposure limit: 2 mg/m³ (OSHA ceiling limit)
- Keep VINEGAR ready for neutralization (acetic acid CH3COOH neutralizes KOH: CH3COOH + KOH → CH3COOK + H2O). 5% household vinegar sufficient
- CHILDREN AND PETS: Keep away during soap making and curing (first 48 hours especially dangerous—uncured soap pH 13-14)
- Never use ALUMINUM, TIN, or non-stainless IRON containers (lye corrodes these metals rapidly, producing hydrogen gas H2—explosion and fire risk). Use:
- STAINLESS STEEL (grade 304 or 316), GLASS (heat-resistant), WOOD, PLASTIC (HDPE, PP only—not PVC)
- "Test pH before use. Uncured soap (pH >11) causes chemical burns. Minimum cure time 4 weeks for sodium soap, 6 weeks for potassium soap related_entries:"
