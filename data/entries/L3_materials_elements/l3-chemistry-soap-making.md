summary: Producing soap by combining wood ash lye (potassium hydroxide) with rendered
  animal fat or plant oils.
steps:
- 'Make lye: fill a wooden barrel or bucket with hardwood ash, pour rainwater through,
  collect brown liquid.'
- 'Test lye strength: a chicken feather should dissolve in strong lye within hours.'
- 'Render fat: chop animal fat, heat slowly with water, strain out solids, let tallow
  cool and harden.'
- Heat fat to ~40°C, slowly add lye while stirring continuously.
- Stir until mixture reaches 'trace'—thickens like thin pudding.
- Pour into molds, cover, let cure 4–6 weeks for mild soap.
warnings:
- Lye (KOH/NaOH) causes severe chemical burns—wear protection, avoid splashing.
- Never add water to lye—always add lye to water/fat to prevent violent reaction.
- Work outdoors or in well-ventilated area—lye fumes are irritating.

## Overview
Producing soap by combining wood ash lye (potassium hydroxide) with rendered animal fat or plant oils.

## Step-by-step
1. Make lye: fill a wooden barrel or bucket with hardwood ash, pour rainwater through, collect brown liquid.
2. Test lye strength: a chicken feather should dissolve in strong lye within hours.
3. Render fat: chop animal fat, heat slowly with water, strain out solids, let tallow cool and harden.
4. Heat fat to ~40°C, slowly add lye while stirring continuously.
5. Stir until mixture reaches 'trace'—thickens like thin pudding.
6. Pour into molds, cover, let cure 4–6 weeks for mild soap.

## Warnings
- Lye (KOH/NaOH) causes severe chemical burns—wear protection, avoid splashing.
- Never add water to lye—always add lye to water/fat to prevent violent reaction.
- Work outdoors or in well-ventilated area—lye fumes are irritating.
