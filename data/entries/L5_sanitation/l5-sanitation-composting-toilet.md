# Composting Toilet Construction & Use

## Overview
Composting toilet systems can reduce pathogen spread when designed and managed correctly.

## Core Principles
- Separate waste from human contact.
- Maintain carbon cover material after each use.
- Control moisture, airflow, and processing time.

## Simple Bucket System (Short-Term)
- Container with secure seat/lid.
- Cover each use with dry carbon material (sawdust/leaves).
- Transfer to managed compost process area.

## Two-Stage Processing Concept
1. Active collection/primary compost phase.
2. Extended curing phase before final use/disposal.

## Siting Rules
- Keep away from water sources and flood zones.
- Provide handwashing station nearby.
- Restrict vectors (flies/rodents) with sealed lids and mesh.

## Operation Checklist
- Add cover material after every use.
- Keep moisture in workable range (not soupy, not bone-dry).
- Record fill dates and rotation schedule.
- Use PPE for handling (gloves, dedicated tools).

## Safety and Use of End Product
- Use conservative curing timelines.
- Prioritize non-food landscape use where uncertainty exists.
- Follow local/public health rules when available.

## Common Mistakes
- No cover material (odor/vector surge).
- Poor siting near water runoff.
- Insufficient curing time.

## Summary
Composting toilets are viable for resilient sanitation if operation discipline and pathogen safety are maintained.
