# Urban Navigation Without GPS

## Overview
Use a layered method: **macro orientation (sun/cardinal)** + **street logic** + **landmark chain**.

## Quick Orientation
- Northern Hemisphere: sun is generally south at local solar noon.
- Shadow-stick method: shortest shadow points roughly north-south line.
- Wind and terrain cues are secondary in dense city centers.

## Street Grid Logic
- Many cities have numbered streets/avenues; higher numbers usually move one direction.
- Observe one-way signs to infer traffic flow patterns.
- Transit maps (even offline photos) can anchor your position.

## Landmark Chain Method
Pick 3 escalating landmarks:
1. Near landmark (1–3 blocks)
2. Mid landmark (district-level)
3. Far landmark (tower/hill/river)

Move from one to the next; update at each checkpoint.

## Dead-Reckoning in Cities
- Count blocks + turns: e.g., N 6 blocks, E 2 blocks.
- Record route shorthand on paper.
- If disoriented: return to last confirmed point.

## Night Navigation
- Prefer major corridors with continuous lighting.
- Avoid tunneling into alleys/dead ends.
- Identify 24/7 anchor points: hospitals, transit hubs, police/fire stations.

## Safety Rules
- Avoid obvious conflict zones/crowd surges.
- Keep backup route options (A/B/C).
- Conserve phone battery for map checks only when needed.

## Common Mistakes
- Trusting memory without checkpoints.
- Cutting through unknown shortcuts.
- Following crowds blindly.
- Ignoring fatigue and daylight limits.

## Summary
Urban navigation without GPS is about process discipline: orient, checkpoint, verify, and adapt safely.
