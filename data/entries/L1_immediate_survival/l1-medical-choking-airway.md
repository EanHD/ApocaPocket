summary: Emergency response for choking and airway obstruction in adults, children,
  and infants.
steps:
- Ask 'Are you choking?' — if patient can cough forcefully, encourage continued coughing.
- 'For conscious adult/child: perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver).'
- Stand behind patient, fist above navel, thrust inward and upward.
- 'For infants (<1 year): alternate 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts.'
- If patient becomes unconscious, lower to ground and begin CPR.
- Check mouth for visible object before each rescue breath.
warnings:
- Do not perform blind finger sweeps — may push object deeper.
- Abdominal thrusts can cause internal injury — patient should be evaluated afterward.
- For pregnant or obese individuals, use chest thrusts instead of abdominal.

## Overview
Choking occurs when an object blocks the airway, preventing breathing. The brain can be damaged in 4-6 minutes without oxygen. Death can occur in 8-10 minutes. Rapid recognition and correct technique save lives. Over 5,000 choking deaths occur yearly in the US - most are preventable.

## Recognition

### Mild Airway Obstruction (Can Still Breathe)
**Signs:**
- Forceful coughing
- Can speak/make sounds
- Wheezing between coughs
- Red face
- Watering eyes

**Action:** 
- Encourage continued coughing (most effective)
- Do NOT interfere
- Stay with victim, call 911 if worsens
- Do NOT perform abdominal thrusts

### Severe Airway Obstruction (Cannot Breathe)
**Universal choking sign:** Hands clutching throat

**Signs:**
- Cannot speak, cry, or cough effectively
- Silent or weak cough
- Cannot breathe or gasping
- Blue lips/face (cyanosis)
- Panicked expression
- Loss of consciousness (progresses rapidly)

**Action:** Immediate intervention required

## Step-by-Step Treatment

### For Conscious Adults & Children (Age 1+)

#### 1. Confirm Complete Obstruction (3 seconds)
- Ask "Are you choking?"
- If victim nods but cannot speak = complete obstruction
- If coughing weakly or silent = complete obstruction
- Call 911 or send someone to call

#### 2. Heimlich Maneuver (Abdominal Thrusts)

**Position:**
1. Stand behind victim
2. Wrap arms around waist
3. Victim should lean slightly forward

**Hand placement:**
- Make fist with one hand
- Place thumb side of fist ABOVE navel, BELOW ribcage
- Center of abdomen
- Grasp fist with other hand

**Thrust technique:**
- Quick, inward and UPWARD thrust
- Use significant force
- Separate thrusts (not continuous pressure)
- Aim: compress diaphragm, force air from lungs to dislodge object

**Repetitions:**
- Perform up to 5 thrusts
- Check if object expelled after each thrust
- Repeat cycles of 5 until:
  - Object expelled
  - Victim starts coughing/breathing
  - Victim becomes unconscious

#### 3. If Victim Becomes Unconscious

- Lower victim to ground (support head)
- Call 911 if not already called
- **Begin CPR immediately** (start with compressions)
- Before each rescue breath cycle:
  - Look in mouth
  - Remove object if visible (only if you can see it)
  - Do NOT do blind finger sweep
- Continue CPR until EMS arrives or object expelled

### For Conscious Infants (<1 Year)

**Do NOT use abdominal thrusts on infants**

#### 1. Position Infant
- Sit or kneel
- Hold infant face-down on your forearm
- Support head/jaw with your hand
- Rest your forearm on your thigh
- Infant's head lower than chest

#### 2. Back Blows (5 repetitions)
- Use heel of hand
- Strike between shoulder blades
- Firm blows (use significant force)
- Complete 5 back blows

#### 3. Flip and Check
- Turn infant face-up (support head)
- Check mouth for object
- Remove if visible and accessible

#### 4. Chest Thrusts (5 repetitions)
- Place 2 fingers on center of chest (just below nipple line)
- Give 5 quick downward thrusts
- Depth: 1.5 inches (4 cm)
- Similar to CPR compressions but slower rate

#### 5. Repeat Cycle
- Alternate 5 back blows + 5 chest thrusts
- Check mouth after each cycle
- Continue until:
  - Object expelled
  - Infant starts crying/coughing
  - Infant becomes unconscious

#### 6. If Infant Becomes Unconscious
- Place on firm surface
- Call 911 if not already called
- Begin infant CPR (30 compressions : 2 breaths)
- Check mouth before each breath cycle

### Special Situations

#### Pregnant or Obese Victim
**Use chest thrusts instead of abdominal:**
- Position same as Heimlich (behind victim)
- Place fist on CENTER of chest (on breastbone)
- Between nipples, similar to CPR hand position
- Thrust straight backward (not upward)
- 5 thrusts, check, repeat

#### Self-Heimlich (You Are Choking Alone)

**Method 1 - Own fist:**
- Make fist, place above navel
- Grasp with other hand
- Bend over hard surface (table, chair back)
- Thrust inward and upward repeatedly

**Method 2 - Chair/counter:**
- Position abdomen against edge of table, countertop, or chair back
- Press/thrust forcefully inward and upward
- Repeat until object expelled

#### Unconscious Victim Found
- Do NOT assume choking
- Check for responsiveness
- Call 911
- Begin CPR (compressions first)
- Check mouth before giving breaths
- If object visible, remove it

## Critical Measurements
- **Heimlich fist position:** Above navel, below ribcage
- **Heimlich thrust direction:** Inward and upward
- **Back blows:** Between shoulder blades, heel of hand
- **Infant chest thrusts:** 1.5 inches (4 cm) depth
- **Cycles:** 5 back blows + 5 chest thrusts (infants)
- **Heimlich repetitions:** Up to 5 thrusts per cycle

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Performing abdominal thrusts on mild obstruction (victim coughing effectively)
- ❌ Blind finger sweeps (can push object deeper)
- ❌ Thrusting too high (on ribcage - can break ribs)
- ❌ Thrusting too low (below navel - ineffective)
- ❌ Using abdominal thrusts on infants
- ❌ Not calling 911 early enough
- ❌ Stopping too soon - continue until successful or unconscious

## Post-Rescue Actions

**After successful object removal:**
- Call 911 or go to emergency room
- Abdominal thrusts can cause internal injuries:
  - Ruptured stomach
  - Ruptured spleen
  - Broken ribs
  - Internal bruising
- Medical evaluation required even if victim "feels fine"
- Watch for abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, persistent coughing

## Prevention (Brief)
- Cut food into small pieces (especially for children/elderly)
- Chew thoroughly before swallowing
- Avoid talking/laughing with food in mouth
- Supervise young children during meals
- Keep small objects away from infants/toddlers
- Avoid hard candy, nuts, grapes for children <4 years

## High-Risk Foods (Most Common Causes)
**Adults:**
- Meat (especially steak, hot dogs)
- Hard candy
- Nuts
- Raw carrots

**Children:**
- Hot dogs
- Grapes (whole)
- Hard candy
- Nuts
- Popcorn
- Chunks of meat/cheese
- Raw vegetables
- Chewing gum

## When to Call 911
- **Immediately** for complete airway obstruction
- Cannot breathe, speak, or cough
- Blue lips/face
- Infant cannot cry
- Victim becomes unconscious
- Object not expelled after multiple attempts
- **After successful removal** (victim needs medical evaluation)

## Warnings
- **Abdominal thrusts can cause internal injury** - always seek medical evaluation afterward
- **Do NOT perform blind finger sweeps** - only remove object if clearly visible
- **Pregnant/obese victims:** Use chest thrusts, not abdominal
- **Infants:** Never use abdominal thrusts - only back blows and chest thrusts
- **Partial obstruction (effective coughing):** Do NOT interfere - coughing is most effective
- **Small object in airway but breathing:** Go to ER immediately - can shift and block airway
