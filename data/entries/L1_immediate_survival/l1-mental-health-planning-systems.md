# Planning Systems: Survive Today, Build Tomorrow

## Why This Matters
**Reactive = survive. Proactive = thrive.**

In survival scenarios:
- **No planning:** Constant crisis, reactive decisions, high stress
- **Good planning:** Prepared for foreseeable problems, resources allocated efficiently
- **Great planning:** Building toward long-term stability, not just surviving day-to-day

**Core principle:** Spend 10% of your time planning to make the other 90% effective.

## Goal Setting

### SMART Goals Framework

#### The Science
**Vague goals fail. Specific goals succeed.** (Locke & Latham, 1990)

**SMART = Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound**

#### Examples: Vague vs. SMART

**Vague:** "Get better at foraging"
**SMART:** "Identify and safely harvest 10 local edible plants by end of month (1 hour practice every 3 days)"

**Vague:** "Improve shelter"
**SMART:** "Weatherproof roof by adding tarp + clay seal before next rain (forecast: 5 days)"

**Vague:** "Learn first aid"
**SMART:** "Master CPR, wound cleaning, and splinting by March 1 (practice 30 min 3x/week)"

#### The SMART Checklist

**Specific:**
- What exactly will you do?
- Who is involved?
- Where will it happen?

**Measurable:**
- How will you know you succeeded?
- What's the quantifiable outcome?
- Can you track progress?

**Achievable:**
- Do you have the resources?
- Is the timeline realistic?
- What obstacles exist?

**Relevant:**
- Why does this matter?
- How does it serve larger goals?
- Is this the right priority now?

**Time-bound:**
- When will you start?
- When will you finish?
- What are the milestones?

### Goal Hierarchy

```
MISSION (5-10 years)
└─ Establish sustainable, secure community

  YEARLY GOALS (12 months)
  ├─ Grow 6 months of food
  ├─ Build defensible perimeter
  └─ Train 5 people in first aid

    QUARTERLY GOALS (3 months)
    ├─ Q1: Clear 2 acres, prepare soil
    ├─ Q2: Plant crops, establish irrigation
    ├─ Q3: Harvest, preserve food
    └─ Q4: Repair/improve infrastructure

      MONTHLY GOALS (4 weeks)
      ├─ Week 1: Clear north field
      ├─ Week 2: Clear south field
      ├─ Week 3: Till and amend soil
      └─ Week 4: Build fence

        WEEKLY GOALS (7 days)
        ├─ Mon-Tue: Cut vegetation
        ├─ Wed-Thu: Remove rocks/roots
        ├─ Fri: Burn debris
        └─ Sat-Sun: Final clearing
```

**Key:** Each level breaks down the one above it. If you complete all weekly goals, you hit monthly. All monthly = quarterly. All quarterly = yearly. Yearly goals = mission progress.

### Review and Adjust
**Goals aren't set in stone. Reality changes them.**

**Weekly review:** Am I on track? What needs to adjust?
**Monthly review:** Did I hit my goals? Why or why not?
**Quarterly review:** Is this still the right direction?

**Adjustment triggers:**
- New information (discovered better method)
- Changed circumstances (weather, illness, threat)
- Resources different than expected (more/less than planned)
- Goal completed early (move to next)

## Project Management

### Break It Down

**Large project → Tasks → Subtasks**

**Example: Build a smokehouse**

```
PROJECT: Smokehouse (for food preservation)
DEADLINE: 4 weeks
OUTCOME: Functional smokehouse, 20 fish capacity

PHASE 1: DESIGN (3 days)
├─ Research designs (half day)
├─ Sketch plan (half day)
├─ List materials needed (1 day)
└─ Identify material sources (1 day)

PHASE 2: MATERIALS (1 week)
├─ Cut lumber (2 days)
├─ Gather stones for base (1 day)
├─ Collect clay for sealing (1 day)
├─ Prepare metal rack (2 days)
└─ Collect cordage/fasteners (1 day)

PHASE 3: CONSTRUCTION (2 weeks)
├─ Build stone base (2 days)
├─ Erect frame (3 days)
├─ Install walls (3 days)
├─ Build roof (2 days)
├─ Install door (1 day)
├─ Seal gaps with clay (2 days)
└─ Install racks (1 day)

PHASE 4: TESTING (2 days)
├─ Test fire (quarter day)
├─ Check smoke distribution (quarter day)
├─ Test with 1 fish (1 day)
└─ Adjust as needed (half day)

PHASE 5: DOCUMENTATION (1 day)
└─ Write up process, measurements, lessons
```

**Total time estimate:** 24 days (with 4-day buffer)

### Dependencies

**Some tasks must happen in order. Others can happen in parallel.**

**Sequential (must wait):**
- Can't build walls before frame
- Can't test before building
- Can't harvest before planting

**Parallel (can do simultaneously):**
- While cutting lumber, someone else gathers stones
- While building base, someone else prepares racks
- While one project runs, plan the next

**Critical path:** The sequence that takes longest. Optimize this first.

### Milestones

**Major checkpoints = morale + course-correction**

**Set milestones for:**
- End of each major phase (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Decision points (choose design, choose location)
- Deliverables (completed component)

**At each milestone:**
- Celebrate (morale matters)
- Review (on schedule? on budget?)
- Adjust plan if needed

## Time Management

### Eisenhower Matrix

**Sort tasks by Urgent vs. Important**

```
                URGENT          NOT URGENT
              ┌────────────────┬────────────────┐
  IMPORTANT   │   DO FIRST     │  SCHEDULE      │
              │  (Crisis)      │  (Planning)    │
              │                │                │
              │ • Injury       │ • Training     │
              │ • Threat       │ • Maintenance  │
              │ • Fire out     │ • Skill dev    │
              ├────────────────┼────────────────┤
NOT IMPORTANT │   DELEGATE     │  ELIMINATE     │
              │  (Busy work)   │  (Waste)       │
              │                │                │
              │ • Routine      │ • Distractions │
              │ • Simple tasks │ • Low value    │
              │ • Admin        │ • Nice-to-have │
              └────────────────┴────────────────┘
```

**Strategy:**
- **Q1 (Urgent + Important):** Drop everything, handle now
- **Q2 (Not Urgent + Important):** This is where growth happens. Schedule it.
- **Q3 (Urgent + Not Important):** Delegate if possible, minimize time
- **Q4 (Neither):** Eliminate. Ruthlessly.

**The trap:** Living in Q1 (crisis mode). The fix: Invest in Q2 (prevent crises).

### Daily Planning

#### The Night Before
**Spend 10 minutes planning tomorrow:**

1. **Review today:** What got done? What didn't? Why?
2. **List tomorrow's tasks:** Brain dump (everything)
3. **Prioritize:** Mark top 3 must-dos
4. **Time block:** Assign tasks to time slots
5. **Prep:** Gather tools/materials needed

**Result:** Wake up knowing exactly what to do. No decision fatigue.

#### Top 3 Priorities
**The Rule:** If you complete your top 3, the day is a success. Everything else is bonus.

**How to pick:**
- What moves key projects forward?
- What prevents problems?
- What has a deadline?

**Write them down.** Physically. Top of your task list. In big letters.

#### Time Blocking
**Don't just list tasks. Assign them to specific hours.**

**Example day:**
```
0600-0700: Breakfast + morning routine
0700-1000: Priority 1 (shelter repair)
1000-1015: Break
1015-1200: Priority 2 (firewood gathering)
1200-1300: Lunch
1300-1500: Priority 3 (water purification)
1500-1530: Break
1530-1700: Routine tasks (cooking, cleaning)
1700-1800: Free time / contingency
1800-1900: Dinner
1900-2000: Planning, documentation, maintenance
2000-2100: Personal time
2100: Sleep prep
```

**Why it works:**
- Realistic time estimates (includes breaks, meals)
- Protected blocks (no multitasking during Priority time)
- Buffer time (contingency for unexpected)
- Visible (you can see if you're behind)

#### Realistic Expectations
**You have less time than you think.**

**The 50% rule:** Things take twice as long as you estimate.

**Why:**
- Interruptions (someone needs help, animal in camp, etc.)
- Fatigue (you slow down as the day goes on)
- Complications (tool breaks, weather changes, etc.)
- Underestimating (you forget steps, prep time, cleanup)

**Solution:** Plan for 4-6 hours of productive work per day, not 12.

### Weekly Planning

#### Sunday Review (1 hour)
**Look back:**
- What went well last week?
- What didn't go well?
- What did I learn?
- What drained energy?
- What gave energy?

**Look forward:**
- What are next week's priorities?
- What deadlines are coming?
- What projects are in motion?
- What could go wrong? (prep contingencies)

**Plan:**
- Set 3-5 weekly goals (specific, measurable)
- Assign big tasks to specific days
- Identify resource needs (gather early in week)
- Schedule time for Q2 activities (training, maintenance, planning)

#### The Weekly Rhythm
**Structure creates efficiency:**

**Monday:** Start strong (tackle hardest task early)
**Tuesday-Thursday:** Deep work (long blocks, focus)
**Friday:** Wrap up (finish loose ends, prep for weekend)
**Saturday:** Maintenance, repairs, group projects
**Sunday:** Rest, review, plan

**Adapt to your situation:** Agricultural cycles, weather patterns, group schedules.

### Seasonal Planning

#### Agricultural Cycles
**In temperate climates, the year has natural phases:**

**Spring (Planting season):**
- Prepare soil, plant seeds
- Repair winter damage
- High energy expenditure

**Summer (Growing season):**
- Water, weed, maintain
- Preserve spring harvests
- Build/improve infrastructure

**Fall (Harvest season):**
- Gather crops, preserve food
- Prepare for winter (firewood, insulation, repairs)
- Hunt/forage before scarcity

**Winter (Survival season):**
- Conserve energy and resources
- Indoor projects (tool making, repairs, training)
- Plan for spring

**Key:** Front-load work in spring/summer. Reap benefits in fall. Rest in winter.

#### Weather Patterns
**Track weather over years → predict next year → plan accordingly**

**Examples:**
- If rain comes in March, plant early crops in April
- If first frost is mid-October, harvest by early October
- If drought hits every 3-4 years, stockpile water

**Documentation:** Weather logs → seasonal summaries → multi-year patterns

#### Resource Availability
**Different resources peak at different times:**

**Spring:** 
- Greens (dandelion, chickweed)
- Sap (maple syrup)
- Fish (spawning runs)

**Summer:** 
- Berries (strawberry → raspberry → blackberry)
- Fresh vegetables
- Abundant game

**Fall:** 
- Nuts (acorns, walnuts, hickory)
- Root vegetables
- Migratory birds

**Winter:** 
- Large game (easier to track in snow)
- Preserved foods
- Evergreen forage (pine needle tea)

**Plan gathering/hunting around these peaks.**

## Contingency Planning

### "What If X Fails?"

**Identify single points of failure:**
- What if the only water source dries up?
- What if the primary shelter is destroyed?
- What if key person is injured?
- What if tool breaks?

**For each:**
1. **How likely?** (low, medium, high)
2. **How bad?** (minor, serious, catastrophic)
3. **Backup plan?** (alternative, redundancy, workaround)

**Priority = Likelihood × Severity**

#### Example: Water Supply

**Primary:** Stream 500m north
**Risk:** Could dry up in drought (medium likelihood, catastrophic severity)

**Backup plans:**
- **Plan B:** Collect rainwater (cistern + tarp)
- **Plan C:** Well-digging location scouted
- **Plan D:** Cache water at secure location
- **Plan E:** Know location of alternate stream (2km east)

**Trigger:** If stream drops below 6 inches, activate Plan B immediately.

### Redundancy
**Critical systems need backups:**

**Fire:**
- Matches (waterproofed)
- Lighter (backup lighter in separate location)
- Flint and steel
- Bow drill materials
- Knowledge (multiple people can start fire)

**Food:**
- Multiple sources (forage, hunt, fish, grow)
- Preserved reserves (smoked, dried, canned)
- Distributed storage (don't keep all in one place)
- Varied crops (if one fails, others may succeed)

**Tools:**
- Duplicate critical tools (knife, axe, saw)
- Repair materials (files, stones, cordage)
- Knowledge (can make replacements if needed)

**The Rule:** Two is one, one is none. Three is comfortable.

### Scenario Planning
**Think through possible futures:**

**Best case:** 
- What if everything goes right?
- How do we capitalize?
- What's the next level?

**Most likely case:** 
- Normal ups and downs
- Steady progress
- Occasional setbacks

**Worst case:** 
- Major failure or disaster
- Minimum viable response?
- How to recover?

**Don't obsess over worst case, but have a plan.** Hope for best, prepare for worst.

## Resource Allocation

### Balance: Short-term vs. Long-term

**The trap:** Spend all effort on immediate survival, no investment in future.
**The fix:** Allocate % of time/energy to long-term projects.

**Suggested split:**
- **70% immediate:** Food, water, shelter, security (today's survival)
- **20% short-term:** Next week/month projects (stability)
- **10% long-term:** Skills, tools, infrastructure (future thriving)

**Adjust based on security:** 
- High risk = 90% immediate, 10% short-term, 0% long-term
- Stable = 50% immediate, 30% short-term, 20% long-term

### Energy Management
**You are a finite resource. Plan accordingly.**

**Track energy, not just time:**
- **High energy tasks:** Heavy labor, focus work, conflict resolution
- **Medium energy:** Routine work, maintenance, light construction
- **Low energy:** Documentation, planning, simple repairs

**Daily strategy:**
- Morning (high energy): Hardest task first
- Midday (medium energy): Steady work
- Evening (low energy): Routine, planning, rest

**Weekly strategy:**
- Don't stack high-energy days (you'll burn out)
- Alternate intense and moderate days
- Build in rest (it's productive time—recovery enables future effort)

### Material Resources
**Track what you have, plan what you need.**

**Inventory:**
- Current stock (what's on hand)
- Consumption rate (how fast you use it)
- Resupply plan (when/how to get more)

**Example: Firewood**
```
Current stock: 15 days at winter burn rate
Consumption: 1 cord per week (cold weather)
Goal: 30-day buffer minimum
Action: Gather 2 cords this week (3 days effort)
Long-term: Cut and stack 6 months supply before winter
```

**For every critical resource, know:**
- How much you have
- How fast it depletes
- When you'll run out
- How to resupply

## Group Coordination

### Who Does What
**Division of labor = efficiency + specialization**

**Assign by:**
- **Skill:** Who's best at this?
- **Preference:** Who enjoys it? (sustainable)
- **Capacity:** Who has time/energy?
- **Learning:** Who needs to develop this skill?

**Rotate:** Don't lock people into roles (cross-training, prevent bottlenecks)

### Communication Systems

#### Daily Stand-Up (10 minutes)
**Whole group, every morning:**

1. **What I did yesterday**
2. **What I'm doing today**
3. **What's blocking me**

**Rules:**
- Keep it brief (no lengthy discussion)
- Everyone speaks (engagement)
- Note blockers (address after meeting)

**Result:** Everyone knows what everyone's doing. No surprises.

#### Weekly Planning Meeting (1 hour)
**Review and plan as group:**

1. **Wins:** What went well this week?
2. **Challenges:** What struggled?
3. **Next week:** What are priorities?
4. **Assignments:** Who's doing what?

**Decision-making:** Consensus when possible, designated leader breaks ties.

#### Documentation
**Write down:**
- Who is responsible for what
- Deadlines and milestones
- Decisions made (and why)
- Resources allocated

**Why:** Memory fails. People disagree on what was said. Written record = clarity.

### Dependencies
**Some tasks depend on others completing first.**

**Example: Building project**
- Alice: Design (3 days)
- Bob: Gather materials (can't start until design done)
- Carol: Construction (can't start until materials gathered)

**Critical:** Communicate dependencies clearly. Bob needs to know when Alice finishes.

**Use a simple chart:**
```
Task              | Owner | Depends on    | Status
------------------|-------|---------------|--------
Design            | Alice | -             | Done
Gather materials  | Bob   | Design        | In progress
Construction      | Carol | Materials     | Waiting
```

## Application Scenarios

**Solo survival:**
- Daily: Top 3 priorities, time blocking
- Weekly: Review week, plan next, adjust strategy
- Seasonal: Match activities to weather/resources

**Small group (3-10 people):**
- Daily stand-up: Coordinate efforts
- Weekly meeting: Set priorities, assign tasks
- Project planning: Break down big projects, track progress

**Community (10+ people):**
- Formal roles: Leaders, coordinators, specialists
- Regular meetings: Communication, decision-making
- Documentation: Written plans, records, procedures
- Long-term: Multi-year plans, infrastructure, education

## Quick Reference Card

```
DAILY PLANNING (10 min):
□ Review yesterday
□ Top 3 priorities (write them down)
□ Time block the day
□ Prep tools/materials needed

WEEKLY PLANNING (1 hour):
□ Review last week (wins, challenges)
□ Set 3-5 weekly goals
□ Assign big tasks to specific days
□ Identify resource needs

SMART GOAL CHECKLIST:
□ Specific (exactly what?)
□ Measurable (how to know success?)
□ Achievable (realistic?)
□ Relevant (why does it matter?)
□ Time-bound (deadline?)

EISENHOWER MATRIX:
Urgent + Important = DO NOW
Not Urgent + Important = SCHEDULE (growth)
Urgent + Not Important = DELEGATE
Neither = ELIMINATE

RESOURCE ALLOCATION:
70% Immediate (survive today)
20% Short-term (next month)
10% Long-term (build future)

Remember: 10% planning time makes 90% execution effective.
Survive today, build tomorrow, thrive forever.
```

**Final Truth:** The best plan is the one you actually follow. Start simple, improve over time. A mediocre plan executed beats a perfect plan imagined.
