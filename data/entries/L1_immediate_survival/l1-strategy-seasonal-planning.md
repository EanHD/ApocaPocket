summary: 'Nature has a calendar. Ignore it and winter kills you. This entry provides season-by-season priorities for temperate regions: what to gather, build, prepare, and when. The rule: prepare for the
  next season during the current one.'
warnings:
- Winter is the great filter — if you haven't prepared food, fuel, and shelter by late fall, you will not survive
- Spring's abundance creates complacency — summer is the time to work hardest, not relax
- Wet fall weather destroys poorly-built shelters — inspect and repair before first freeze
- Seasonal depression is real in dark winter months — plan indoor projects and social activities
steps:
- 'SPRING (March-May, temperate): FOOD: Foraging explosion (greens, shoots, roots emerging). Fish spawning runs. Migrating birds. Plant awareness = critical now. SHELTER: Repair winter damage. Air out damp
  shelters. PREPARATION: Plant gardens (if long-term). Scout new areas (snow melted, terrain visible). Make tools while hands aren''t numb. Gather early tinder (birch bark before bugs infest). MINDSET:
  Energy returns after winter. Make big plans now. RISK: Spring flooding — be above high water. Late frost kills early plants.'
- 'SUMMER (June-August): FOOD: Berries peak. Fish abundant. Greens bolt (get bitter/tough). Nuts forming but not ripe. Focus on PRESERVATION: dry berries, smoke fish, make jerky. SHELTER: Improve permanent
  structures. Build backup shelter. PREPARATION: Stockpile firewood (needs 3-6 months to season). Gather materials for winter projects. Make clothing/footwear while weather is warm. Scout winter water sources
  (streams that won''t freeze). MINDSET: This is WORK season. Every sunny day spent idle is a mistake. RISK: Dehydration, heat exhaustion. Sunburn = infection risk.'
- 'FALL (September-November): FOOD: Nut harvest (acorns, hickory, walnut — process and store). Late berries. Root vegetables (wild and cultivated). Fish runs (salmon, spawning). Hunting season (animals
  fattened, preparing for winter). LAST CHANCE for food gathering — race against first freeze. SHELTER: Winterize (seal gaps, improve insulation, stockpile materials). Test shelter in first cold snaps.
  PREPARATION: Finish firewood stockpile (minimum 1 cord per person for winter). Complete all construction projects. Move food stores to dry, cool, rodent-proof location. MINDSET: Urgency. First snow comes
  faster than you think. RISK: Early freeze, wet cold (hypothermia risk even above freezing).'
- 'WINTER (December-February): FOOD: Live off stored food. Ice fishing if lakes freeze. Track and hunt (snow makes tracking easy but travel hard). Starvation period for wildlife — easier to trap/hunt desperate
  animals. Supplement with pine needle tea (vitamin C). SHELTER: Stay put unless emergency. Maintain fire continuously. Repair as needed. PREPARATION: Make tools indoors (carving, cordage, repair clothing).
  Plan spring projects. Process hides and bones. MINDSET: Endurance and patience. Celebrate small joys (warm fire, good meal, clear sky). Watch for depression. RISK: Carbon monoxide (sealed shelters), hypothermia
  (wet clothes/bedding), cabin fever (conflict), running out of food/fuel.'
- 'YEAR-ROUND PRIORITIES: Always maintain 3-day food cache, 7-day firewood supply, and backup shelter materials. Every season, set a milestone: Spring = plant/build, Summer = preserve/stockpile, Fall =
  harvest/finalize, Winter = maintain/plan.'
- 'REGIONAL VARIATIONS: DESERT: hot/cool seasons replace spring/fall. Monsoons = water harvest opportunity. TROPICAL: wet/dry seasons. Focus on rain protection and preventing rot. ARCTIC: extreme winter
  prep = life/death. Summer is hyperactivity period (24hr daylight). MEDITERRANEAN: mild winter = year-round foraging possible, but still prepare for wet season.'
- 'CALENDAR INTEGRATION: Learn to read nature''s calendar: First frost = 30 days until hard freeze. Leaves turning = 15-30 days until leaf fall (gather acorns before they''re buried). Birds migrating =
  cold front coming. Insect activity ending = freeze imminent. These are more reliable than a calendar.'

# Seasonal Survival Planning — What to Do When

Nature has a calendar. Ignore it and winter kills you. This entry provides season-by-season priorities for temperate regions: what to gather, build, prepare, and when. The rule: prepare for the next season during the current one.
