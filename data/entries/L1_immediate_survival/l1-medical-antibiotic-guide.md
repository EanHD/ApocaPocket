# Antibiotic Guide - Selection, Dosing, and Resistance Prevention

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️

**Antibiotics are life-saving but also life-threatening if misused.**

- **Incorrect use = Antibiotic resistance:** Bacteria evolve faster, antibiotics stop working
- **Allergic reactions:** Penicillins cause anaphylaxis (throat swelling, death) in 0.01-0.05% of people
- **Not for viruses:** Antibiotics do NOTHING for colds, flu, COVID-19, most sore throats, bronchitis (70% viral)
- **Some infections need surgery:** Abscess, appendicitis, necrotizing fasciitis - antibiotics alone insufficient

**Use antibiotics ONLY when:**
1. Confirmed or highly suspected bacterial infection
2. Benefits outweigh risks (infection will worsen without treatment)
3. No medical care available within reasonable timeframe

**This entry is for:**
- Trained medical personnel in resource-limited settings
- Wilderness medicine with delayed evacuation
- Collapse scenarios without medical infrastructure

**IF MEDICAL CARE AVAILABLE WITHIN 24-48 HOURS:** Wait for professional diagnosis. Many infections self-resolve or are viral.

## Overview

Antibiotics kill or inhibit bacteria. They are ineffective against viruses, fungi, and parasites (different drugs required). **Correct antibiotic selection** requires identifying:
1. **Infection type** (pneumonia, UTI, skin infection, etc.)
2. **Likely bacteria** (different bacteria cause different infections)
3. **Antibiotic spectrum** (which bacteria each antibiotic kills)

**This guide covers:**
- Bacterial vs viral infection recognition
- Common bacterial infections and causative organisms
- First-line antibiotic selection
- Dosing by weight
- Treatment duration
- Side effects and contraindications
- Resistance prevention

## Bacterial vs. Viral Infections

### Key Differences

| Feature | Bacterial Infection | Viral Infection |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Onset** | Gradual (over days) | Sudden (hours to 1 day) |
| **Fever** | High, sustained (102-104°F+) | Moderate, fluctuating (100-102°F) |
| **Symptom duration** | Persists or worsens >7-10 days | Improves in 5-7 days |
| **Nasal discharge** | Thick, yellow/green, one side | Clear or white, both sides |
| **Throat** | Pus on tonsils, no cough | Red, cough present |
| **Lab markers** | High white blood cell count (WBC), especially neutrophils | Normal or low WBC |
| **Response to antibiotics** | Improves in 48-72 hours | No change |

### Common VIRAL Infections (Antibiotics NOT Indicated)

**Treatment for viral infections:**
- Rest, fluids, symptom management (fever reducers, decongestants)
- Time (5-7 days for most)
- Antivirals (if available): Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for flu, Acyclovir for herpes/shingles

### Common BACTERIAL Infections (Antibiotics Indicated)

**✅ Antibiotics appropriate for:**
- Strep throat (Group A Streptococcus)
- Pneumonia (bacterial)
- Urinary tract infections (UTIs)

---

## Allergy and Cross-Reactivity

### Penicillin Allergy

**True allergy (1% of those who report it):**
- Anaphylaxis (throat swelling, difficulty breathing, shock)
- Hives within 1 hour of dose
- Severe rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome - rare)

**Not true allergy (9% of "allergies"):**
- Mild rash (does not spread, not itchy)
- GI upset (nausea, diarrhea)
- Rash after multiple days of treatment (often viral, not allergy)

**If TRUE penicillin allergy:**
- Avoid: Amoxicillin, Augmentin, all penicillins
- Use caution: Cephalosporins (5-10% cross-reactivity - avoid if anaphylaxis, okay if mild allergy)
- Safe alternatives: Macrolides (azithromycin), Tetracyclines (doxycycline), Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin)

### Sulfa Allergy

**Affects ~10% of population**

**If sulfa allergy:**
- Avoid: TMP-SMX (Bactrim), Sulfasalazine
- Safe alternatives: All other antibiotics (cephalosporins, penicillins, macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones)

---

## Treatment Duration and Resistance Prevention

### Why Full Course Matters

**Incomplete treatment:**
- Kills weak bacteria, leaves strong bacteria alive
- Strong bacteria multiply = resistant infection
- Resistance spreads to other people
- Next infection: Same antibiotic won't work

**"I feel better after 3 days - can I stop?"**
**NO.** Feeling better = most bacteria dead, but some remain. Those remaining are strongest. Stopping early = they regrow.

### Recommended Treatment Durations

| Infection Type | Minimum Duration | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Strep throat | 10 days | Prevents rheumatic fever, kidney damage |
| Uncomplicated UTI (women) | 3 days (TMP-SMX, cipro) or 5 days (nitrofurantoin) | Longer for men (7 days) |
| Skin infection | 7-10 days | Continue until redness/swelling gone |
| Pneumonia | 5-7 days | Minimum 5 days, continue 3 days after fever resolves |
| Sinusitis | 5-7 days | |
| Ear infection | 10 days (<2 years), 5-7 days (>2 years) | |
| Lyme disease | 14-21 days | Doxycycline |

**General rule:** Continue until symptoms resolved + 2-3 more days

### Signs Antibiotic Is Working

**Expect improvement in 48-72 hours:**
- Fever decreasing
- Pain/redness decreasing (skin infections)
- Energy improving
- Appetite returning

**If NO improvement after 72 hours:**
- Wrong antibiotic (resistant bacteria)
- Wrong diagnosis (viral infection, abscess needing drainage)
- Complication (spread to deeper structures)
- → Switch antibiotics or seek medical care

---

## Side Effects and Adverse Reactions

### Common Side Effects (Usually Mild)

| Side Effect | Cause | Management |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Diarrhea** | All antibiotics (kill gut bacteria) | Take probiotics, eat yogurt, stay hydrated; if severe/bloody → C. difficile (seek care) |
| **Nausea** | Most antibiotics | Take with food (except doxycycline + dairy = reduced absorption) |
| **Yeast infection (vaginal)** | Antibiotics kill normal flora | Antifungal cream (miconazole, clotrimazole) or fluconazole 150mg single dose |
| **Photosensitivity (sunburn)** | Doxycycline, TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones | Avoid sun, use SPF 50+ sunscreen |

### Serious Adverse Reactions (STOP ANTIBIOTIC IMMEDIATELY)

| Reaction | Symptoms | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Anaphylaxis** | Throat swelling, difficulty breathing, hives, low blood pressure | **EPINEPHRINE** 0.3mg IM immediately, call 911 |
| **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome** | Painful rash with blistering, mouth sores, fever | STOP antibiotic, seek emergency care (can be fatal) |
| **C. difficile colitis** | Severe watery diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain (after/during antibiotics) | STOP antibiotic, seek care (needs metronidazole or vancomycin) |
| **Tendon rupture** | Sudden pain/pop in Achilles tendon (fluoroquinolones) | STOP antibiotic, immobilize, seek care |
| **QT prolongation** | Palpitations, fainting (azithromycin, fluoroquinolones in those with heart disease) | STOP antibiotic, seek care |

---

## Drug Interactions

### Important Interactions

**Tetracyclines (doxycycline) + Dairy/Calcium/Iron:**
- Binds antibiotic, reduces absorption
- Take 2 hours before or after dairy, antacids, iron supplements

**Metronidazole + Alcohol:**
- Disulfiram reaction (severe nausea, vomiting, flushing, rapid heart rate)
- Avoid alcohol during treatment + 3 days after

**Fluoroquinolones + Antacids/Calcium/Iron:**
- Reduces absorption
- Take 2 hours before or after

**TMP-SMX + Warfarin (blood thinner):**
- Increases warfarin effect (bleeding risk)
- Monitor closely if on warfarin

**Antibiotics + Birth Control Pills:**
- Rifampin decreases birth control effectiveness
- Other antibiotics: Controversial (likely no interaction, but use backup method to be safe)

---

## Antibiotic Resistance: Prevention Strategies

### How Resistance Develops

1. **Antibiotic exposure** kills susceptible bacteria
2. **Resistant mutants survive** (natural selection)
3. **Resistant bacteria multiply** (no competition)
4. **Resistance genes spread** between bacteria (horizontal gene transfer)
5. **Resistant infection** develops (antibiotic no longer works)

### Global Threat

- **23,000 deaths/year (US)** from antibiotic-resistant infections
- **700,000 deaths/year (global)** - projected 10 million/year by 2050
- **Last-resort antibiotics failing** (colistin, carbapenems)
- **Post-antibiotic era:** Routine surgeries dangerous (wound infections untreatable)

### Personal Actions to Prevent Resistance

**✓ DO:**
- Use antibiotics only for bacterial infections (not viruses)
- Complete full course (even if feeling better)
- Use narrow-spectrum when possible (targets specific bacteria)
- Follow dosing schedule (maintains blood levels)
- Get vaccinated (prevents infections = less antibiotic use)

**✗ DON'T:**
- Use antibiotics for colds, flu, bronchitis (90% viral)
- Stop early ("feeling better")
- Save leftover antibiotics for later
- Share antibiotics with others
- Use animal antibiotics on humans (different dosing, contamination risk)
- Demand antibiotics from doctor if viral infection

---

## Special Populations

### Pregnancy

**Safe antibiotics:**
- Penicillins (amoxicillin, Augmentin) - Category B
- Cephalosporins (cephalexin) - Category B
- Azithromycin - Category B
- Nitrofurantoin - Category B (but avoid at term - hemolysis risk in newborn)

**AVOID in pregnancy:**
- Tetracyclines (doxycycline) - tooth staining, bone growth issues in fetus
- Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) - cartilage damage in fetus
- TMP-SMX (first trimester) - neural tube defects

### Breastfeeding

**Generally safe:**
- Most antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, azithromycin)

**Use caution:**
- TMP-SMX (if infant <1 month or jaundiced)
- Fluoroquinolones (cartilage concerns)

**AVOID:**
- Tetracyclines (tooth staining in infant)

### Renal (Kidney) Impairment

**Requires dose reduction:**
- Most antibiotics cleared by kidneys
- If known kidney disease, reduce dose (or extend interval)
- Monitor closely

### Liver Impairment

**Requires dose reduction:**
- Macrolides (azithromycin)
- Metronidazole

---

## When Medical Care Is Required

**Seek immediate medical care if:**
- Signs of sepsis (severe infection): Fever + confusion, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure
- Not improving after 72 hours on antibiotics
- Infection worsening despite antibiotics
- Suspected abscess (may need drainage)
- Severe infections: Meningitis (headache, neck stiffness, light sensitivity), endocarditis (heart valve infection), osteomyelitis (bone infection)
- Anaphylaxis (allergic reaction)

**Infections requiring IV antibiotics (oral inadequate):**
- Pyelonephritis (kidney infection) with vomiting
- Severe pneumonia (low oxygen, confusion)
- Sepsis
- Endocarditis
- Osteomyelitis
- Meningitis

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Using antibiotics for cold/flu | Antibiotics ineffective for viruses - rest, fluids, symptom management |
| Stopping antibiotics when feeling better | Complete full course (prevents resistance, relapse) |
| Using someone else's leftover antibiotics | Wrong dose, wrong drug, incomplete course = resistance risk |
| Not taking with food (if recommended) | Many antibiotics cause nausea - take with food unless contraindicated |
| Demanding antibiotics from doctor for viral infection | Trust diagnosis - misuse accelerates resistance |
| Using expired tetracyclines | TOXIC (Fanconi syndrome) - discard expired tetracyclines |
| Taking doxycycline with dairy | Binds antibiotic (reduces effectiveness) - separate by 2 hours |
| Drinking alcohol on metronidazole | Severe disulfiram reaction (vomiting, rapid heart rate) |

## Antibiotic Stockpile Priorities

**Essential antibiotics for emergency stockpile:**

1. **Amoxicillin** (500mg tablets) - Respiratory, ear infections
2. **Augmentin** (875/125mg) - Sinusitis, bites, resistant infections
3. **Cephalexin** (500mg) - Skin infections, UTIs
4. **Doxycycline** (100mg) - Broad spectrum, atypical infections
5. **Azithromycin** (Z-pack) - Atypical pneumonia, penicillin allergy
6. **Ciprofloxacin** (500mg) - UTIs, GI infections
7. **Metronidazole** (500mg) - Anaerobic infections, abscesses

**Storage:** See medication storage entry (room temp, dark, dry - years past expiration often still effective)
