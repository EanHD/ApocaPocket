summary: 'Immobilize fractures and dislocations to prevent further injury, reduce pain, and enable transport. The rule: splint above and below the injury, immobilizing the joints on either side of the break.'
warnings:
- Never attempt to straighten or realign a deformed limb unless circulation is absent below the fracture (no pulse, blue/white fingers or toes)
- Check circulation BEFORE and AFTER splinting — if fingers/toes become blue, numb, or cold, the splint is too tight
- Open fractures (bone visible or puncture wound at fracture site) require wound coverage BEFORE splinting — do not push bone back in
- 'Spinal injury: DO NOT MOVE the patient unless in immediate danger. Immobilize head and neck in position found.'
- Swelling will increase for 24-48 hours — check and loosen bindings regularly
steps:
- 'Rigid splint materials: straight sticks (wrist-thick), trekking poles, tent poles, rolled newspaper/magazine, corrugated cardboard, bark slabs, split bamboo, rifle/shotgun barrel.'
- 'Padding: place cloth, moss, leaves, or clothing between splint and skin. Padding prevents pressure sores and improves immobilization.'
- 'Forearm fracture: place one rigid splint on top (dorsal) and one on bottom (palmar) of forearm. Extend from mid-upper-arm past fingertips. Bind at 4 points above and below fracture. Sling arm across
  chest.'
- 'Lower leg fracture: place splints on inside and outside of leg. Extend from mid-thigh to past the foot. Bind at 5-6 points. Include the foot in a natural position. A buddy''s leg can serve as splint
  (tie injured leg to uninjured leg).'
- 'Improvised traction splint (femur fracture): critical for thigh fractures which can bleed 1-2 liters internally. Use two long sticks — one from armpit to past foot, one from groin to past foot. Pad groin
  and armpit. Apply gentle traction by pulling foot and securing with cravat to lower splint end.'
- 'Sling-and-swath for shoulder/collarbone: fold triangular bandage (or large cloth cut diagonally). Place forearm in sling at 90° angle. Tie at neck. Wrap a ''swath'' (belt or cloth strip) around torso
  and arm to prevent swinging.'
- 'Finger splint: tape injured finger to adjacent finger (buddy splint) with small padding between. Or use a popsicle stick/twig as rigid splint with tape.'
- 'Ankle/foot: wrap in pillow or thick clothing and bind. Or use figure-8 wrap with elastic/cloth bandage. Leave toes exposed to monitor circulation.'
- 'After splinting: elevate injured limb above heart level when possible. Apply cold (wet cloth, creek water, snow in cloth) for 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off to reduce swelling.'
- 'Check circulation every 30 minutes: pulse below fracture, skin color, temperature, sensation, and ability to move fingers/toes.'

# Improvised Splinting and Immobilization

Immobilize fractures and dislocations to prevent further injury, reduce pain, and enable transport. The rule: splint above and below the injury, immobilizing the joints on either side of the break.
