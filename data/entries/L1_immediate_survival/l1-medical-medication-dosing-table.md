summary: Quick-reference dosing for common over-the-counter medications. These are the most useful drugs to stockpile for survival situations. All doses assume normal kidney and liver function.
warnings:
- Acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose destroys the liver — NEVER exceed 3000mg/day (some sources say 4000mg). Damage is irreversible and fatal without transplant.
- Ibuprofen on empty stomach causes GI bleeding — always take with food or water
- Aspirin must NEVER be given to children under 16 — causes Reye's syndrome (fatal liver/brain disease)
- Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) causes drowsiness — do not use when alertness is critical for survival
- These doses are for ADULTS unless pediatric dosing is specified. Children are NOT small adults — overdosing a child is easy and dangerous.
- 'Drug interactions: do NOT combine multiple NSAIDs (ibuprofen + aspirin + naproxen). Do NOT combine acetaminophen with alcohol.'
steps:
- 'IBUPROFEN (Advil/Motrin) — Pain, fever, inflammation. Adult: 200-400mg every 4-6 hours. Max 1200mg/day OTC. Take with food. Children >6 months: 5-10mg/kg every 6-8 hours.'
- 'ACETAMINOPHEN (Tylenol/Paracetamol) — Pain, fever. Adult: 500-1000mg every 4-6 hours. MAX 3000mg/day. Children: 10-15mg/kg every 4-6 hours. SAFE in pregnancy.'
- 'DIPHENHYDRAMINE (Benadryl) — Allergic reactions, itching, sleep aid. Adult: 25-50mg every 4-6 hours. Max 300mg/day. Children 6-12: 12.5-25mg every 4-6 hours. FOR ANAPHYLAXIS: this is NOT a substitute
  for epinephrine.'
- 'LOPERAMIDE (Imodium) — Diarrhea. Adult: 4mg first dose, then 2mg after each loose stool. Max 16mg/day. Do NOT use if bloody diarrhea or fever >38.5°C — the body needs to expel the pathogen.'
- 'ASPIRIN — Pain, fever, heart attack. Adult: 325-650mg every 4-6 hours. Max 4000mg/day. HEART ATTACK DOSE: chew one 325mg tablet immediately if chest pain suspected. NOT for children under 16.'
- 'ORAL REHYDRATION: not a drug but more important than most drugs. See ORS entry for exact recipe.'
- 'NAPROXEN (Aleve) — Pain, inflammation. Longer-lasting than ibuprofen. Adult: 220mg every 8-12 hours. Max 660mg/day. Take with food.'
- HYDROCORTISONE CREAM (1%) — Insect bites, rashes, contact dermatitis. Apply thin layer 2-3 times daily. Do not use on open wounds or infections.
- ANTACIDS (Tums/calcium carbonate) — Heartburn, calcium supplement. 500-1000mg as needed. Also useful for calcium supplementation in survival diet.
- 'STOCKPILE PRIORITY: (1) Ibuprofen, (2) Acetaminophen, (3) Diphenhydramine, (4) Loperamide, (5) ORS packets, (6) Hydrocortisone cream, (7) Aspirin.'
