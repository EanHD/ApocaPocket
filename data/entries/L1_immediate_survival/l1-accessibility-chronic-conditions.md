# Chronic Conditions: Survival Management

## Overview

Chronic medical conditions require ongoing management that becomes more complex during survival scenarios. This entry covers diabetes, respiratory conditions, epilepsy, cardiac conditions, kidney disease, and severe allergies with practical protocols for medication preservation, emergency response, and adaptation strategies.

**Key Principle:** Prevention, preparation, and early intervention prevent life-threatening crises.

## Diabetes (Type 1 & Type 2)

### Insulin Storage

**Optimal Storage Conditions:**
- **Temperature:** 36-46°F (2-8°C) - refrigerator temp
- **Unopened vials/pens:** Can last months if kept cool
- **Opened vials/pens:** 28 days at room temperature (up to 86°F)
- **NEVER freeze:** Freezing destroys insulin permanently

**Field Storage Methods:**

**Evaporative Cooling:**
1. Wrap insulin in damp cloth
2. Place in clay pot or container
3. Set container in larger pot with water between
4. Keep cloth damp (evaporation cools inner pot)
5. Place in shade, breezy location
6. Can achieve 10-20°F cooling below ambient

**Underground Storage:**
1. Dig hole 2-3 feet deep (below frost line, cool zone)
2. Place insulin in waterproof container
3. Insulate with sand/soil
4. Mark location clearly
5. Temp remains stable (~50-60°F)

**Zeer Pot (Pot-in-Pot Cooler):**
1. Large clay pot filled with wet sand
2. Smaller pot inside (insulin stored here)
3. Cover with damp cloth
4. Evaporation through clay = cooling
5. Achieves 40-50°F in hot climates

⚠️ **Signs of Insulin Degradation:**
- Clumping or particles (normally clear)
- Color change (yellowish or brown)
- Reduced effectiveness (blood sugar doesn't respond)
- **Action:** If insulin appears degraded, ration remaining good insulin, evacuate

**Rationing Insulin:**
- If supply limited, prioritize Type 1 diabetics (cannot survive without insulin)
- Reduce doses by 10-20% (monitor blood glucose closely)
- Increase carb counting accuracy
- Consider lower-carb diet (reduces insulin needs)

### Blood Glucose Monitoring

**Target Range:**
- **Normal:** 80-130 mg/dL (fasting), <180 mg/dL (after meals)
- **Survival target:** 100-200 mg/dL (tolerate slightly higher to conserve supplies)

**Monitoring Schedule:**
| Time | Why |
|------|-----|
| Morning (fasting) | Baseline, overnight pattern |
| Before meals | Determine mealtime insulin dose |
| 2 hours after meals | Check post-meal spike |
| Before bed | Prevent overnight lows |
| If feeling unwell | Distinguish high vs low |

**Test Strip Conservation:**
- Test 4x/day minimum (morning, meals, bed)
- If supply limited, prioritize morning and symptoms
- Use visual symptoms to supplement (see hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia below)

**Improvised Testing (Extremely Limited Accuracy):**
- Taste urine (sweet = high blood sugar) - **ONLY IN EMERGENCY**
- Symptom monitoring (primary method if no strips)

### Carb Counting

**Basics:**
- 15g carbs = 1 "exchange"
- Insulin-to-carb ratio varies (e.g., 1 unit insulin per 15g carbs)
- Person should know their ratio

**Survival Foods (Carb Content per Cup):**
| Food | Carbs (approx) |
|------|----------------|
| White rice (cooked) | 45g |
| Beans (cooked) | 40g |
| Potato (medium) | 30g |
| Apple | 25g |
| Bread (1 slice) | 15g |
| Milk (1 cup) | 12g |
| Berries (1 cup) | 15-20g |
| Nuts (1 oz) | 5-10g |
| Meat/fish | 0g (protein/fat only) |

**Carb Counting Strategy:**
- Measure portions (don't estimate)
- Log food and insulin doses
- Track patterns (adjust ratios as needed)

### Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)

**Definition:** <70 mg/dL (dangerous), <54 mg/dL (severe)

**Symptoms:**
- **Early:** Shakiness, sweating, hunger, rapid heartbeat, confusion
- **Severe:** Loss of consciousness, seizures, death

**Treatment (Rule of 15):**
1. **Consume 15g fast-acting carbs:**
   - 4 glucose tablets
   - 1/2 cup (4 oz) juice or regular soda
   - 1 tablespoon honey or sugar
   - 3-4 hard candies
2. **Wait 15 minutes**
3. **Recheck blood sugar**
4. **If still <70 mg/dL, repeat**
5. **Once >70 mg/dL, eat meal or snack with protein** (prevents rebound low)

⚠️ **Severe Hypoglycemia (Unconscious):**
- **Glucagon injection** (if available): 1mg IM or SubQ
- Person will wake in 5-15 minutes
- Give carbs once awake
- If no glucagon: Rub honey/glucose gel inside cheek (NOT if unconscious = choking risk)
- **Evacuate** if prolonged or recurrent

**Prevention:**
- Consistent meal times
- Don't skip meals
- Adjust insulin for activity (exercise increases sensitivity)
- Always carry fast-acting carbs

### Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)

**Definition:** >180 mg/dL (concerning), >250 mg/dL (danger zone)

**Symptoms:**
- Frequent urination, excessive thirst, blurred vision, fatigue, fruity breath

**Treatment:**
1. Check blood sugar (confirm elevation)
2. Small dose rapid-acting insulin (per person's correction factor)
3. Drink water (rehydrate)
4. Recheck in 2 hours
5. If no improvement, repeat insulin

⚠️ **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - LIFE-THREATENING:**
- Blood sugar >250 mg/dL + ketones
- Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rapid breathing, confusion, fruity breath
- **Treatment:**
  1. Insulin (multiple doses, frequent monitoring)
  2. Hydration (aggressive - 1-2 liters water over 1-2 hours)
  3. Electrolytes (salt, potassium-rich foods)
  4. **EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY** (DKA is medical emergency)

**Prevention:**
- Take insulin as prescribed (don't skip doses)
- Monitor blood sugar regularly
- Stay hydrated
- Check for ketones if blood sugar >250 mg/dL (ketone test strips)

## Asthma & COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)

### Inhaler Preservation

**Storage:**
- Room temperature (68-77°F ideal)
- Protect from extreme heat (>120°F = propellant explosion risk)
- Protect from freezing (inactive ingredients may separate)
- Keep dry (moisture clogs device)

**Shelf Life:**
- **Metered-dose inhalers (MDI):** Check expiration date, usually 1 year
- **Dose counters:** Track remaining doses
- **No counter:** Shake and estimate weight (light = low)

**Extending Inhaler Life:**
- Use spacer (improves delivery, may reduce doses needed)
- Clean mouthpiece weekly (prevents clog)
- Prime before first use (spray 2-4 test puffs)

### Avoid Triggers

**Common Asthma Triggers:**
| Trigger | Avoidance Strategy |
|---------|-------------------|
| Smoke | Position upwind from fire, vent shelters |
| Dust | Damp-mop surfaces, seal sleeping area |
| Cold air | Breathe through scarf/cloth, pre-warm air |
| Strong odors | Avoid perfumes, limit cooking smells |
| Pollen | Stay indoors during high pollen times (morning, windy days) |
| Mold | Keep shelter dry, sunlight kills mold |
| Exercise | Warm up slowly, use rescue inhaler 15 min before activity |

**Trigger Diary:**
- Log symptoms and potential triggers
- Identify patterns
- Avoid confirmed triggers

### Rescue Protocols

**Rescue Inhaler (Albuterol/Salbutamol):**
- **Standard dose:** 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed
- **Acute attack:** 2-4 puffs every 20 minutes for 1 hour, then reassess

**Acute Asthma Attack Response:**
1. **Sit upright** (don't lie down - worsens breathing)
2. **Use rescue inhaler:** 2-4 puffs
3. **Slow breathing** (in through nose, out through pursed lips)
4. **Wait 20 minutes,** recheck symptoms
5. **If no improvement:** Repeat inhaler (2-4 puffs)
6. **After 3 doses (1 hour):** If still struggling, **EVACUATE**

⚠️ **Emergency Signs (Evacuate Immediately):**
- Difficulty speaking (can only say a few words)
- Lips or fingernails turning blue (cyanosis)
- Rapid breathing (>30 breaths/min)
- Retractions (skin sucking in between ribs)
- Rescue inhaler not working
- Loss of consciousness

**Tripod Position (Severe Distress):**
- Sit upright
- Lean forward
- Hands on knees or table
- Opens airways maximally

### Improvised Treatments (Limited Effectiveness)

**Caffeine (Mild Bronchodilator):**
- Strong coffee or tea
- Contains theophylline (related to asthma meds)
- Can help mild symptoms
- NOT substitute for inhaler

**Steam Inhalation:**
- Hot water + towel over head
- Humidifies airways (reduces irritation)
- Helps with mucus clearance
- **Caution:** Not for acute attack (can worsen in some people)

## Epilepsy

### Seizure First Aid

**Generalized Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal) Seizure:**
1. **Protect head:** Place soft item (folded clothing) under head
2. **Time seizure:** Note start time (call for help if >5 minutes)
3. **Clear area:** Remove hard/sharp objects
4. **Turn on side** (once jerking stops) - Recovery position prevents choking
5. **Do NOT restrain** (can cause injury)
6. **Do NOT put anything in mouth** (can't swallow tongue - this is a myth)
7. **Stay with person** until fully conscious

**After Seizure (Postictal Period):**
- Person will be confused, sleepy
- Speak calmly, reassure
- Allow to rest
- Monitor breathing
- Usually recovers in 10-30 minutes

⚠️ **Status Epilepticus (EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY):**
- Seizure lasting >5 minutes
- Multiple seizures without regaining consciousness
- LIFE-THREATENING (brain damage risk)
- If rectal diazepam available, administer (prescribed emergency medication)

**Other Seizure Types:**
- **Absence (petit mal):** Brief staring, unresponsive, 10-20 seconds, no first aid needed
- **Focal (partial):** Affects one area (arm twitching, strange sensation), no loss of consciousness, guide to safety

### Medication Consistency

**Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs):**
- Must take at **exact same time daily** (set alarm)
- Missing doses = increased seizure risk
- Common AEDs: Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, levetiracetam

**Dosing Protocol:**
- Use timer or watch alarm
- Never skip dose
- If vomiting within 30 min of dose, repeat dose
- Do NOT double dose if you miss (take next scheduled dose)

**Supply Management:**
- Carry 3-month minimum supply
- Protect from moisture and heat
- Store in original container (preserves shelf life)

⚠️ **Withdrawal Risk:**
- Sudden discontinuation = severe seizures, status epilepticus
- If supply runs out, **EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY**
- Rationing: Reduce by max 10% per week (risky)

### Seizure Triggers

**Common Triggers:**
- **Missed medications** (most common)
- **Sleep deprivation** (maintain 7-8 hours nightly)
- **Stress** (relaxation techniques)
- **Alcohol** (avoid entirely)
- **Flashing lights** (photosensitive epilepsy, ~3% of people)
- **Dehydration** (maintain hydration)
- **Hypoglycemia** (eat regularly)

**Prevention:**
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Take medications on time
- Avoid known triggers
- Manage stress
- Stay hydrated and fed

## Heart Conditions

### Nitroglycerin Storage

**Sublingual Tablets:**
- Store in **original amber glass bottle** (light-sensitive)
- Tight seal (deactivates with air exposure)
- Room temperature (68-77°F)
- Shelf life: 3-6 months after opening
- **Test potency:** Should cause slight burning/tingling under tongue

**Spray:**
- More stable (2-year shelf life)
- Protect from extreme heat
- Prime before use (spray test dose away from face)

### Avoiding Overexertion

**Activity Modification:**
| Activity Level | Heart Rate Target | RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Rest | Baseline | 1-2 (very light) |
| Light activity | <50% max HR | 3-4 (light) |
| Moderate | 50-70% max HR | 5-6 (somewhat hard) |
| Vigorous | >70% max HR | 7-9 (hard/very hard) - AVOID |

**Max Heart Rate Estimate:** 220 - age
- Example: 60 years old = 220 - 60 = 160 max HR
- Moderate activity target = 80-112 bpm

**Signs of Overexertion:**
- Chest pain or pressure
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Excessive fatigue
- Irregular heartbeat

**Action:** Stop activity immediately, rest, use medications as prescribed

### Recognizing Heart Attack

**Symptoms (CALL FOR HELP IMMEDIATELY):**
- **Chest pain/pressure** (often described as "elephant sitting on chest")
- **Pain radiating** to left arm, jaw, back, or stomach
- **Shortness of breath**
- **Nausea, vomiting**
- **Cold sweat**
- **Anxiety, sense of doom**

**Women & Diabetics:** May have atypical symptoms (fatigue, indigestion, back pain)

**First Aid:**
1. **Call for evacuation** (time = heart muscle)
2. **Sit or lie down** (semi-upright position preferred)
3. **Aspirin** (chew 1 regular aspirin, 325mg, if not allergic)
4. **Nitroglycerin** (if prescribed): 1 tablet under tongue, repeat every 5 min × 3 if pain persists
5. **Monitor vitals** (pulse, breathing)
6. **CPR** if unconscious and no pulse (30 compressions:2 breaths)

⚠️ **DO NOT DELAY EVACUATION:** Every minute without treatment = more heart damage

---

## Kidney Disease

### Dialysis & Evacuation

⚠️ **CRITICAL: People on dialysis cannot survive >4-7 days without treatment**

**Dialysis Schedule:**
- **Hemodialysis:** Typically 3x per week, 3-4 hours per session
- **Peritoneal dialysis:** Daily, multiple exchanges

**No Field Alternatives:**
- Dialysis cannot be improvised
- No medications substitute for dialysis
- Toxins accumulate rapidly without treatment

**Action:**
- **Evacuate immediately** if dialysis access lost
- Plan should include pre-identified evacuation route and transport
- Carry medical summary (diagnosis, last dialysis date, bloodwork)

### Fluid & Electrolyte Management (Pre-Dialysis or Early-Stage CKD)

**Fluid Restriction (if applicable):**
- Limit based on doctor's orders (typically 1-1.5 liters/day for dialysis patients)
- Track intake (mark water bottle, log drinks)
- Avoid salty foods (increases thirst)

**Potassium Management:**
| High Potassium (AVOID) | Low Potassium (SAFE) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Bananas, oranges | Apples, berries |
| Potatoes, tomatoes | Carrots (cooked), green beans |
| Beans, lentils | White rice, pasta |
| Nuts, seeds | Bread |
| Salt substitutes (often potassium chloride) | Regular salt (limit sodium) |

**High Potassium Risk:**
- Irregular heartbeat
- Muscle weakness
- Cardiac arrest
- **Treatment:** Restrict intake, evacuate for dialysis

**Phosphorus Restriction:**
- Limit dairy, beans, nuts, cola
- Binders (if available): Calcium carbonate with meals

---

## Severe Allergies

### EpiPen Storage

**Temperature:**
- **Ideal:** 68-77°F (room temperature)
- **Acceptable:** 59-86°F
- **Avoid:** Extreme heat (>95°F) or freezing (<32°F)

**Storage Solutions:**
- Insulated pouch
- Inner pocket (body heat keeps warm in cold weather)
- Cool area in hot weather (avoid direct sun)

**Checking EpiPen:**
- View through window (liquid should be clear)
- If discolored (yellow, brown) or contains particles = expired, replace if possible
- Expired EpiPen may still work partially (use if no alternative)

### Avoidance Strategies

**Food Allergies:**
- Label foods clearly
- Dedicated cooking utensils (no cross-contamination)
- Educate group about allergy severity
- Person with allergy confirms ingredients before eating

**Insect Sting Allergies:**
- Avoid nests (scout before setting camp)
- Wear protective clothing
- Carry EpiPen at all times
- If stung, use EpiPen immediately (don't wait for symptoms)

**Environmental Allergies:**
- Identify allergen (plant, animal)
- Avoid contact
- Wash skin if exposed (removes allergen)

### Anaphylaxis Protocol

**Symptoms (Can Develop Rapidly - Minutes):**
- **Skin:** Hives, itching, flushing, swelling (face, lips, tongue)
- **Respiratory:** Difficulty breathing, wheezing, throat tightness
- **Cardiovascular:** Rapid pulse, low blood pressure, dizziness, loss of consciousness
- **GI:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps

**Treatment:**
1. **EpiPen immediately** (at first sign of serious reaction)
   - Remove cap
   - Press firmly into outer thigh (through clothing is OK)
   - Hold 3 seconds
   - Massage injection site 10 seconds
2. **Call for evacuation** (epinephrine is temporary, symptoms can return)
3. **Lie flat, elevate legs** (improves blood flow to heart/brain)
4. **Second dose** (if no improvement in 5-10 minutes and second EpiPen available)
5. **Monitor breathing** (CPR if needed)

⚠️ **Biphasic Reaction:**
- Symptoms can return 4-12 hours after initial reaction
- Observe for 24 hours
- Evacuate even if symptoms resolve

### Substitute Foods

**Common Allergens & Substitutes:**
| Allergen | Substitute |
|----------|------------|
| Milk | Nut milks (almond, coconut), oat milk |
| Eggs | Flax "eggs" (1 tbsp ground flax + 3 tbsp water), applesauce |
| Wheat | Rice, corn, quinoa, potato starch |
| Soy | Coconut aminos (for soy sauce), other legumes |
| Tree nuts | Seeds (sunflower, pumpkin), roasted chickpeas |
| Peanuts | Sun butter (sunflower seed butter), other nut butters |
| Fish | Chicken, beans, tofu (if soy-safe) |

---

## Medication Management (All Conditions)

### Storage Principles

**General Guidelines:**
| Factor | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Temperature | 68-77°F (room temp) unless specified |
| Light | Amber bottles or dark storage |
| Moisture | Sealed containers, desiccant packs |
| Air exposure | Keep bottles tightly closed |

**Field Storage Solutions:**
- Underground cache (cool, stable temp)
- Insulated container (protects from extremes)
- Waterproof bags (moisture barrier)
- Original containers (preserves integrity)

### Rationing Protocols

**When Supply Limited:**
1. **Inventory:** Count all medications, calculate days remaining
2. **Prioritize:** Life-sustaining meds first (insulin, anti-epileptics, heart meds)
3. **Reduce:** Lower doses by 10-20% (monitor closely for symptoms)
4. **Stretch:** Skip non-essential doses (e.g., preventive meds vs rescue meds)
5. **Evacuate:** Before supply runs out (give time to reach medical care)

⚠️ **Never Taper Abruptly:**
- Anti-epileptics = seizure risk
- Beta-blockers (heart meds) = rebound hypertension, heart attack
- Steroids = adrenal crisis
- **Always taper gradually** (10-25% reduction per week)

### Withdrawal Protocols

**Symptoms of Withdrawal (Vary by Medication):**
- Nausea, vomiting
- Tremors, seizures
- Anxiety, agitation
- Rapid heart rate, high blood pressure
- Confusion

**Management:**
- Taper slowly if possible
- Hydrate well
- Rest, reduce stress
- Monitor vitals
- **Evacuate if severe symptoms**

### Alternatives (Limited)

**No True Substitutes for Chronic Condition Meds:**
- Herbals and supplements DO NOT replace prescription medications
- Improvised treatments are temporary, not curative

**Supportive Measures:**
- Diabetes: Low-carb diet reduces insulin needs
- Asthma: Avoid triggers, breathing exercises
- Epilepsy: Consistent sleep, stress reduction (does NOT replace meds)
- Heart: Rest, stress management
