summary: You have rocks, sticks, and plant material. What can you actually build? This matrix maps available resources to achievable projects, prioritized by survival value. Prevents wasting time on low-value
  or impossible projects. Tool progression unlocks capabilities geometrically.
warnings:
- Attempting advanced projects without basic tools wastes energy — stone knives come before log cabins
- Resource depletion is real — don't clear-cut all nearby deadwood in the first week (you'll need it for months)
- Biodiversity = resilience — if one resource fails, you have alternatives. Don't rely on single material.
- Quality > quantity in tool-making — one good knife beats five mediocre ones
- Energy ROI: Only build projects where output > input (making a basket you'll use daily = yes, decorative carving = no)
steps:
- 'ASSESSMENT PHASE (first 2-3 days): Walk your area systematically. Note: water sources, rock types, tree species, plant materials, animal signs, terrain features. Draw a mental or physical map. Radius:
  15-30 minute walk from camp.'
- 'TIER 1 — IMMEDIATE (no tools needed): Tinder (dry grass, bark), kindling (dead twigs), insulation (leaves, pine needles), water containers (bark, large leaves folded), cordage materials (long grass,
  vines), digging stick (straight hardwood branch), sleeping platform (logs/branches), ground cloth (bark sheets), basic shelter frame (fallen branches).'
- 'TIER 2 — SHARP ROCK UNLOCKS: With one sharp stone flake, you can make: feather sticks (fire starting), stripped bark (cordage), sharpened stakes (shelter pins, fish spears), notches in wood (fire bow,
  trap triggers), cut saplings (frame materials), scrape hides, dig roots, process fibrous plants. Priority: get a sharp rock or make one (see stone tool entries).'
- 'TIER 3 — KNIFE/BLADE UNLOCKS: With a quality cutting tool (stone blade in handle, salvaged metal, made knife), you can make: bow drill set (reliable fire), deadfall traps, fish traps, containers (carved
  wood, sewn bark), cordage (processed inner bark, nettle fiber), friction fire sets, snares, sewing needles (bone), arrows (if you have arrow points), clothing repairs. Priority: secure or make a durable
  knife.'
- 'TIER 4 — AXE/CHOPPING TOOL UNLOCKS: With a hafted axe (stone or metal head on handle), you can make: log shelters, large structural timbers, canoes (dugout or bark), firewood stockpiles, fence posts,
  permanent camp infrastructure. Axe is the civilization tool — it scales everything up.'
- 'TIER 5 — FIRE UNLOCKS: With reliable fire, you can: boil water (purification, cooking), fire-harden wooden tools, create charcoal (for metallurgy, filtration), render fat (waterproofing, food preservation),
  smoke meat/hides, create pitch glue (heat pine resin), keep warm, signal, deter animals.'
- 'RESOURCE-TO-PROJECT MATRIX: ROCKS → percussion tools, cutting edges, fire starting, grinding stones, pot boilers, hammer stones. STICKS/BRANCHES → shelter frames, fire fuel, digging tools, weapons, traps,
  handles. BARK → cordage, containers, tinder, roofing, tanning agent. PLANT FIBER → rope, clothing, baskets, nets. HIDE/BONE → clothing, cordage (sinew), tools (needles, awls), containers. CLAY → pottery,
  daub (sealing), bricks (if you can fire them).'
- 'DECISION PRIORITIES: Ask for each project: (1) Does it directly address a survival need? (2) Can I complete it with current tools? (3) Will it last, or is it disposable? (4) Does it create new capabilities
  (multiplier effect)? (5) Energy in vs energy out — is it worth it? Example: A bow-drill set scores high on all 5. A basket scores medium. A decorative carving scores zero in survival.'
- 'AVOID THESE TRAPS: Don''t attempt log cabin before you can make fire reliably. Don''t make 20 arrows before you have a bow. Don''t build elaborate permanent shelter before confirming water source is
  year-round. Don''t make pottery before confirming clay fires without exploding. Prototype small first.'
- 'REGIONAL ADJUSTMENTS: Desert = prioritize shade structures, water containers, navigation aids. Forest = prioritize cutting tools, cordage, traps. Coastal = prioritize fishing gear, watercraft, salt harvesting.
  Arctic = prioritize insulation, fire tools, fur processing. Adapt the matrix to your environment.'

# Resource Assessment Matrix — What Can I Make?

You have rocks, sticks, and plant material. What can you actually build? This matrix maps available resources to achievable projects, prioritized by survival value. Prevents wasting time on low-value or impossible projects.

## COMMON FATAL MISTAKES

### 1. SKIPPING TOOL PROGRESSION (Attempting Advanced Projects Too Soon)
- **Mistake:** Trying to build log cabin without axe, or pottery without fire, or bow without knife
- **Result:** Wasted days of effort, failed project, energy deficit, demoralization
- **Avoid:** Follow tier progression. Master Tier 1-2 before attempting Tier 3-4.

### 2. RESOURCE HOARDING (Gathering But Not Using)
- **Mistake:** Collecting massive piles of materials "for later" but never building anything
- **Result:** Rotting materials, wasted time gathering, no actual survival capability gained
- **Avoid:** Build as you gather. Small functional project > large material pile.

### 3. OVER-ENGINEERING (Perfectionism in Crisis)
- **Mistake:** Spending 3 days on "perfect" shelter when 3-hour functional shelter would suffice
- **Result:** Exposure deaths, energy wasted, other survival needs neglected
- **Avoid:** Minimum Viable Product first. Improve later if time permits.

### 4. IGNORING ENERGY ROI (Building Low-Value Projects)
- **Mistake:** Making decorations, elaborate carvings, or unnecessary items before core needs met
- **Result:** Caloric deficit, core survival tasks incomplete (no fire, inadequate shelter)
- **Avoid:** Every project must answer: "Does this directly help me survive?" If no, defer.

### 5. DEPLETING NEARBY RESOURCES (Clear-Cutting)
- **Mistake:** Cutting all nearby firewood in Week 1, or stripping all bark from accessible trees
- **Result:** Month 2-6, you're walking farther and farther for basic materials, exhausting yourself
- **Avoid:** Sustainable harvesting. Take deadwood first, leave live trees. Rotate areas.

### 6. SINGLE-RESOURCE DEPENDENCE (No Backup)
- **Mistake:** "I only need pine bark for cordage" → pine trees get disease → no cordage
- **Result:** Critical capability lost when single resource fails
- **Avoid:** Learn 2-3 alternatives for each critical material (cordage, tinder, cutting tools).

### 7. POOR QUALITY TOOLS (Many Bad Tools Instead of One Good One)
- **Mistake:** Making 5 mediocre stone knives instead of 1 excellent hafted blade
- **Result:** All 5 break quickly, inefficient cutting, frustration, more wasted time making replacements
- **Avoid:** Quality > quantity. Take time to make durable, effective tools.

### 8. NO PROTOTYPE TESTING (Building at Full Scale Immediately)
- **Mistake:** Building full-size canoe without testing smaller version, or kiln-firing 20 pots without testing clay
- **Result:** Catastrophic failure after massive time investment (canoe sinks, all pots explode)
- **Avoid:** Prototype small first. Test material. Learn failure modes cheaply.

### 9. IGNORING SEASONAL CONSTRAINTS (Wrong Time for Project)
- **Mistake:** Starting agriculture in fall (no growing season), or hide tanning in freezing winter
- **Result:** Project fails due to weather/season, or you freeze while working on non-urgent task
- **Avoid:** See [l1-strategy-seasonal-planning] — align projects with seasons.

### 10. SOLO COMPLEX PROJECTS (No Help When Needed)
- **Mistake:** Attempting to lift/move large logs alone, or build shelter without assistance
- **Result:** Injury (crushed by log), hernias, exhaustion, or incomplete project
- **Avoid:** Know when to ask for help. Some projects require multiple people.

**See diagram:** `diagrams/resource-assessment-matrix.svg`

**Tool progression is exponential:** Hands → Sharp rock (10x capability) → Knife (10x again) → Axe (10x again) → Fire (10x everything). Focus on unlocking the next tier, not perfecting current tier.
