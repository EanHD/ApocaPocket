summary: Most spiders and scorpions are harmless. A few cause serious symptoms. Black widow and brown recluse (North America), funnel-web (Australia), scorpions (global). Treatment focuses on pain management
  and symptom monitoring. Most bites resolve without intervention.
warnings:
- Black widow venom causes severe muscle cramping that can mimic appendicitis or heart attack
- Brown recluse bites cause tissue necrosis (skin death) that develops over days — looks minor initially
- Scorpion stings in children can be life-threatening (respiratory failure) even when adults have mild symptoms
- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to spider/scorpion venom are possible but rare
steps:
- 'BLACK WIDOW (Latrodectus): Identified by: shiny black body with red hourglass marking on underside. BITE: sharp pinprick, or may not be felt. SYMPTOMS (15-60 min): severe muscle cramps (abdomen, back,
  chest), rigid abdominal muscles, sweating, nausea, headache. TREATMENT: Pain control (opioids if available, NOT ibuprofen — makes symptoms worse). Muscle relaxants if available. Ice pack to bite. Most
  symptoms resolve in 24-48 hours. Antivenom exists but rarely needed. DANGER: elderly, children, those with heart conditions are high-risk.'
- 'BROWN RECLUSE (Loxosceles): Identified by: brown body with dark violin shape on back. BITE: initially painless or mild sting. SYMPTOMS: Over 2-8 hours — red, swollen, bullseye pattern. Over 1-3 days
  — center becomes black/purple (tissue necrosis). Crater develops (can be 1-6 inches). Systemic symptoms rare but include fever, chills, nausea. TREATMENT: Clean wound. Ice pack. Pain control. Elevate
  if on limb. AVOID CUTTING OR DEBRIDING (let dead tissue slough naturally — cutting worsens damage). Heal by secondary intention over weeks to months. PREVENTION: shake out clothing/shoes in recluse territory.'
- 'TARANTULA (large hairy spiders): BITE: painful but medically insignificant. URTICATING HAIRS (New World tarantulas): defensive hairs flicked from abdomen — cause itching, rash, respiratory irritation
  if inhaled. TREATMENT: wash area, apply hydrocortisone cream if available. Tape and peel (removes embedded hairs).'
- 'SCORPION STINGS: Most scorpions cause only local pain (like a wasp sting). DANGEROUS SPECIES (bark scorpion - SW USA, African/Middle Eastern species): SYMPTOMS: severe pain, numbness, muscle twitching,
  difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, agitation. CHILDREN: risk of respiratory failure. TREATMENT: Ice pack. Pain control. Immobilize limb. Monitor breathing closely. Antivenom exists for bark
  scorpions (hospitals). FIELD TREATMENT: supportive — keep calm, monitor airway, be prepared for rescue breathing.'
- 'CENTIPEDE BITES: Painful but not dangerous (except giant tropical species). Local swelling, redness. TREATMENT: clean wound, ice, pain meds.'
- 'GENERAL TREATMENT FOR ARTHROPOD ENVENOMATION: (1) Clean bite/sting with soap and water. (2) Ice pack 10-15 minutes on, 10-15 minutes off. (3) Elevate if on limb. (4) Pain control (acetaminophen or ibuprofen
  for most; avoid ibuprofen for black widow). (5) Monitor for systemic symptoms (spreading rash, difficulty breathing, severe cramping). (6) Mark the edge of redness/swelling — if it spreads rapidly, this
  indicates infection (antibiotics needed) or severe envenomation.'
- 'ANAPHYLAXIS (rare but serious): If patient develops: difficulty breathing, swelling of face/tongue/throat, widespread rash, dizziness — treat as anaphylaxis (see entry). Epinephrine if available. Position
  on back with legs elevated. Airway support critical.'
- 'INFECTION: Bite wounds commonly get infected (bacteria from spider''s mouth). Watch for: increasing pain after 24-48 hours, pus, red streaks, fever. Clean daily, apply honey or antiseptic if available.
  If red streaks appear (lymphangitis), antibiotics essential (see medication entry).'
- 'WHEN TO WORRY: (1) Difficulty breathing. (2) Chest or abdominal pain. (3) Severe, spreading muscle cramps. (4) Altered mental status. (5) Rapidly expanding necrotic wound. (6) Children or elderly with
  systemic symptoms. All require medical evacuation if possible.'
