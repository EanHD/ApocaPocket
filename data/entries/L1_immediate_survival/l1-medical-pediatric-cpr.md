# Pediatric CPR - Age-Specific Differences and Protocols

## Overview

**Pediatric cardiac arrest is NOT "adult CPR on a smaller person."** Causes, techniques, compression depth, breath ratio, and AED settings differ significantly. Using adult technique on infants can cause fatal injuries; using infant technique on adults is ineffective.

**Critical difference:** Most adult cardiac arrests are CARDIAC (heart problem). Most pediatric arrests are RESPIRATORY (breathing problem that leads to heart stopping). **This changes the approach.**

**Survival rates:** 
- Adult cardiac arrest: 10-30% survival with CPR
- Pediatric respiratory arrest (if CPR started immediately): 70-90% survival
- Pediatric cardiac arrest: 5-15% survival (worse than adults)

**Key takeaway:** Early recognition and intervention in pediatric cases saves lives. Act FAST when child stops breathing.

## Age Categories and Definitions

| Category | Age Range | CPR Technique | Key Difference |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Infant** | <1 year (0-12 months) | 2 fingers, 1.5 inch depth, cover mouth+nose | Smallest, most fragile |
| **Child** | 1 year to puberty (~8-12 years) | 1-2 hands, 2 inch depth, mouth-to-mouth | Transitional technique |
| **Adult** | Puberty onset and older | 2 hands, 2-2.4 inch depth, full force | Standard CPR |

**Puberty signs:** Breast development (females), armpit hair (males), voice change (males). When in doubt, use child technique (safer to under-compress than over-compress).

**Weight approximation:**
- Infant: <20 lbs (9 kg)
- Child: 20-55 lbs (9-25 kg)
- Adult: 55+ lbs (25+ kg)

## Infant CPR (<1 Year Old)

### Recognition of Cardiac Arrest

**Check for responsiveness:**
- Tap bottom of foot firmly
- Shout baby's name
- No response = unconscious

**Check for breathing:**
- Look at chest (rising/falling?)
- Listen for breath sounds
- Feel for breath on your cheek
- Check for 10 seconds maximum
- Gasping or no breathing = NOT BREATHING

**Check for pulse (if trained):**
- Brachial artery (inside of upper arm, between elbow and shoulder)
- Press with 2 fingers
- Check for 10 seconds
- If <60 beats per minute OR no pulse = CARDIAC ARREST

### Infant CPR Protocol - Single Rescuer

**Step 1: Activate Emergency Response (30 seconds)**
- **If witnessed arrest:** Call 911 first, then start CPR
- **If unwitnessed arrest:** Do 2 minutes of CPR first, THEN call 911
- Use speakerphone if alone
- Verify address is clear

**Step 2: Position Infant**
- Hard, flat surface (floor, table)
- On back, head neutral (not tilted back - blocks infant airway)

**Step 3: Chest Compressions**

**Hand position:**
- Place 2 fingers (index and middle) on center of chest
- Just BELOW nipple line (one finger width below)
- NOT on xiphoid process (tip of breastbone - can puncture liver)

**Compression technique:**
- **Depth:** 1.5 inches (4 cm) - about 1/3 of chest depth
- **Rate:** 100-120 compressions per minute
- **Allow full recoil:** Lift fingers slightly between compressions (don't maintain pressure)
- **Count aloud:** "One, two, three..." to maintain rhythm

**30 compressions (takes ~15 seconds)**

**Step 4: Open Airway**
- Head-tilt chin-lift (gentle tilt, not extreme)
- Infant's airway is small - too much tilt can block it

**Step 5: Rescue Breaths**
- **Cover BOTH mouth and nose** with your mouth (infant faces are small)
- Seal completely
- Give 2 breaths, 1 second each
- Watch for chest rise (small rise, not big inflation)
- If chest doesn't rise: Re-position head, try again

**Step 6: Continue Cycle**
- **30 compressions : 2 breaths**
- Minimize interruptions (<10 seconds)
- Continue until:
  - AED/defibrillator arrives
  - Baby shows signs of life (breathing, movement, crying)
  - Emergency responders take over
  - You are physically unable to continue

**DO NOT STOP** to check for pulse unless baby shows obvious signs of life.

### Infant CPR Protocol - Two Rescuers

**If second person available:**

**Compression technique changes:**
- **Two-thumb encircling hands method:**
  - Both thumbs on center of chest (just below nipple line)
  - Fingers wrapped around infant's back (support)
  - Compress with thumbs
  - More effective than 2-finger method

**Ratio changes:**
- **15 compressions : 2 breaths** (instead of 30:2)
- Faster cycle = less time between breaths = better for respiratory arrest
- Switch compressors every 2 minutes (fatigue)

---

## Child CPR (1 Year - Puberty)

### Recognition of Cardiac Arrest

**Check for responsiveness:**
- Tap shoulders firmly
- Shout child's name
- No response = unconscious

**Check for breathing:**
- Look, listen, feel (10 seconds max)
- Gasping or no breathing = NOT BREATHING

**Check for pulse (if trained):**
- Carotid artery (neck, between windpipe and muscle)
- 2 fingers, light pressure
- 10 seconds
- No pulse or <60 bpm with poor perfusion = CARDIAC ARREST

### Child CPR Protocol - Single Rescuer

**Step 1: Activate Emergency Response**
- **If witnessed arrest OR child >8 years:** Call 911 first
- **If unwitnessed arrest AND child <8 years:** 2 minutes CPR first, then call
- Reasoning: Young children more likely respiratory cause (need oxygen NOW)

**Step 2: Position Child**
- Hard, flat surface
- On back, head tilted back (more than infant, less than adult)

**Step 3: Chest Compressions**

**Hand position:**
- **Smaller child (1-5 years):** 1 hand, heel of hand on center of chest
- **Larger child (5+ years):** 2 hands (like adult CPR)
- Lower half of breastbone, between nipples
- Avoid xiphoid process

**Compression technique:**
- **Depth:** 2 inches (5 cm) - about 1/3 of chest depth
- **Rate:** 100-120 compressions per minute
- **Allow full recoil**
- Use body weight (straight arms, shoulders over hands)

**30 compressions (~15 seconds)**

**Step 4: Open Airway**
- Head-tilt chin-lift (more pronounced than infant)

**Step 5: Rescue Breaths**
- Pinch nose closed
- Seal your mouth over child's mouth
- 2 breaths, 1 second each
- Watch for chest rise (visible but not excessive)

**Step 6: Continue Cycle**
- **30 compressions : 2 breaths**
- Minimize interruptions
- Continue until help arrives or child revives

### Child CPR Protocol - Two Rescuers

**Compression technique:**
- 2 hands for all children (more effective with two rescuers)
- Same hand position

**Ratio changes:**
- **15 compressions : 2 breaths** (better for respiratory arrest)
- One person compresses, one gives breaths
- Switch roles every 2 minutes

---

## Adult CPR (Puberty+) - Quick Reference

**Included for comparison:**

- **Hand position:** 2 hands, center of chest (lower half of breastbone)
- **Depth:** 2-2.4 inches (5-6 cm)
- **Rate:** 100-120 compressions per minute
- **Ratio:** 30 compressions : 2 breaths (or continuous compressions if no breaths)
- **Breath delivery:** Pinch nose, seal mouth, 1 second per breath

**Single rescuer:** 30:2 ratio  
**Two rescuers:** 30:2 ratio (same as single - adult cardiac arrest less responsive to increased breaths)

---

## Comparison Table: Infant vs Child vs Adult CPR

| Factor | Infant (<1 year) | Child (1-puberty) | Adult (puberty+) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Hand Position** | 2 fingers below nipple line | 1-2 hands on center chest | 2 hands on center chest |
| **Compression Depth** | 1.5 inches (4 cm) | 2 inches (5 cm) | 2-2.4 inches (5-6 cm) |
| **Compression Rate** | 100-120/min | 100-120/min | 100-120/min |
| **Single Rescuer Ratio** | 30:2 | 30:2 | 30:2 |
| **Two Rescuer Ratio** | 15:2 | 15:2 | 30:2 |
| **Breath Delivery** | Cover mouth + nose | Pinch nose, seal mouth | Pinch nose, seal mouth |
| **Pulse Check Location** | Brachial (upper arm) | Carotid (neck) | Carotid (neck) |
| **Airway Opening** | Neutral head position | Head tilt (moderate) | Head tilt (pronounced) |
| **Call 911 Timing (alone)** | After 2 min CPR | After 2 min CPR (if <8y) | Immediately |
| **Primary Cause** | Respiratory failure | Respiratory or trauma | Cardiac (heart attack) |
| **Survival Rate** | 70-90% (respiratory only) | 60-80% (respiratory only) | 10-30% |

## Critical Differences Explained

### Why Smaller Compression Depth?

**Physics:**
- Infant ribs are cartilage (soft, flexible)
- Adult-depth compression on infant = crushed chest, punctured lungs/liver
- Goal: Compress chest 1/3 of its depth (this varies by body size)

**Infant chest depth:** ~4.5 inches (11 cm) → 1/3 = 1.5 inches  
**Child chest depth:** ~6 inches (15 cm) → 1/3 = 2 inches  
**Adult chest depth:** ~7-8 inches (18-20 cm) → 1/3 = 2.4 inches

### Why Different Compression:Breath Ratios?

**Pediatric cardiac arrests are usually caused by:**
1. Choking (blocked airway)
2. Drowning (water in lungs)
3. Asthma (can't breathe)
4. Poisoning (depressed respiration)
5. Trauma (blood loss, chest injury)

**Common theme:** They stopped breathing first, THEN heart stopped.

**Solution:** Need more oxygen (breaths) relative to circulation (compressions). Hence 15:2 ratio with two rescuers.

**Adult cardiac arrests are usually:**
- Heart attack (heart electrical problem)
- Heart can't pump blood even though lungs have oxygen
- Compressions more important than breaths
- Hence compression-only CPR works for adults (doesn't work for children)

### Why Different Call 911 Timing?

**Unwitnessed pediatric arrest:**
- Unknown how long child wasn't breathing
- Brain damage starts at 4-6 minutes without oxygen
- 2 minutes of CPR (deliver oxygen) before calling = better outcomes
- After 2 minutes, call for help (child may survive longer with your CPR)

**Witnessed adult arrest or older child:**
- Just collapsed (less time without oxygen)
- Need defibrillator ASAP (heart electrical problem)
- Call first, then start CPR

### Why Cover Both Mouth and Nose (Infants)?

**Anatomy:**
- Infant faces are small
- Trying to seal just mouth = air leaks from nose
- Trying to seal just nose = air leaks from mouth
- Both together = reliable seal

**Children 1+:** Face large enough to seal mouth while pinching nose closed.

---

## Special Considerations

### Choking vs. Cardiac Arrest

**If you witnessed choking:**
- Perform choking relief first (back blows, chest thrusts for infant; Heimlich for child/adult)
- If child becomes unconscious, then start CPR
- **Before giving breaths, look in mouth for object** (if visible, sweep out with finger)

**Blind finger sweep:** Only in infant/child if you SEE the object (random sweeping can push object deeper)

### Drowning

**Key difference:** Give **5 rescue breaths FIRST** (before compressions)
- Lungs full of water/no oxygen
- Need oxygen immediately
- Then start 30:2 or 15:2 cycle

**If alone:** Still do 2 minutes CPR before calling (respiratory arrest)

### Trauma (Car Accident, Fall)

**Suspect spinal injury:**
- Minimize head/neck movement
- Use **jaw-thrust** instead of head-tilt chin-lift:
  - Place fingers behind angle of jaw
  - Lift jaw forward (opens airway without moving neck)
  - Difficult technique - only if trained

**If jaw-thrust doesn't open airway:** Use head-tilt chin-lift (delivering oxygen is priority over potential spine injury)

**Severe bleeding:**
- Control bleeding FIRST (direct pressure, tourniquet)
- Then start CPR
- If bleeding controlled, proceed with standard CPR

### Hypothermia (Cold Water Drowning)

**"Not dead until warm and dead"**
- Children in cold water can survive 30+ minutes without oxygen (protective effect)
- Continue CPR until child is warm (>86°F / 30°C core temp) AND still unresponsive
- Warm gradually (remove wet clothes, dry blankets, skin-to-skin)
- Transport to hospital even if seems "dead"

### Electrical Injury

**Scene safety FIRST:**
- Ensure power source is OFF before touching child
- If power still on, do NOT approach (you'll become second victim)

**Once safe:**
- Expect cardiac arrest (electrical shock disrupts heart)
- Call 911 immediately (need defibrillator)
- Start CPR

### Poisoning/Drug Overdose

**If naloxone (Narcan) available and opioid suspected:**
- Give naloxone first (intranasal or intramuscular)
- Then start CPR if still not breathing
- Naloxone reverses opioid respiratory depression

**Otherwise:**
- Standard CPR protocol
- Save poison container/substance for EMS

---

## AED (Automated External Defibrillator) Use on Children

### AED Pad Placement

**Infant (<1 year):**
- **Pediatric pads preferred** (deliver lower shock dose)
- Placement: One pad on chest (center), one pad on back (between shoulder blades)
- If pediatric pads unavailable: Adult pads acceptable (survival > theoretical burn risk)

**Child (1-8 years or <55 lbs):**
- **Pediatric pads preferred**
- Placement: One pad upper right chest, one pad lower left ribs (same as adult)
- If pediatric pads unavailable: Adult pads acceptable

**Older child (8+ years or 55+ lbs):**
- Adult pads
- Standard adult placement

**Pad spacing:**
- Pads must NOT touch each other
- If pads would overlap on small child: Front-back placement

### AED Protocol

1. **Turn on AED** (follow voice prompts)
2. **Expose chest** (remove clothing, wipe dry if wet)
3. **Apply pads** (as shown in pictures on pads)
4. **Stand clear** (ensure no one touching child)
5. **AED analyzes** (will say "analyzing, do not touch patient")
6. **Shock advised:**
   - Ensure no one touching
   - Press shock button
   - Resume CPR immediately (30:2 cycle)
7. **No shock advised:**
   - Resume CPR immediately
   - AED will reanalyze every 2 minutes

**Do NOT:**
- ❌ Remove AED pads once applied
- ❌ Stop CPR for more than 10 seconds (except during shock)
- ❌ Touch child during analysis or shock
- ❌ Use AED in standing water (move child to dry area first)

**AED on infants (<1 year):**
- Manual defibrillator preferred (hospital/EMS)
- If AED is only option: Use with pediatric dose attenuator if available
- If no pediatric setting: Standard AED acceptable (survival > no defibrillation)

---

## Compression-Only CPR (If Unable/Unwilling to Give Breaths)

### When to Use

- Untrained bystander (never learned rescue breaths)
- Fear of disease transmission
- Mouth/face trauma preventing seal
- Vomiting

### Protocol

**For adults:** Compression-only CPR is **effective** (survival similar to 30:2)

**For children/infants:** Compression-only CPR is **less effective** but **better than nothing**

**Technique:**
- Continuous chest compressions
- 100-120 per minute
- No interruptions except for AED
- Same hand position and depth as standard CPR

**Why less effective for children:**
- Primary problem is lack of oxygen (respiratory arrest)
- Compressions circulate deoxygenated blood (not as helpful)
- But some circulation > no circulation

**Key message:** If you cannot or will not give breaths, still do compressions. You may still save a life.

## Common CPR Mistakes by Age Group

### Infant CPR Mistakes

| ❌ Mistake | Why It's Dangerous | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Using heel of hand | Crushes chest, liver injury | 2 fingers only |
| Compressing too deep (>1.5 inches) | Rib fractures, organ damage | 1.5 inches maximum |
| Head tilted too far back | Blocks infant airway | Neutral position (sniffing position) |
| Covering only mouth | Air leaks from nose | Cover mouth AND nose |
| Leaving infant on soft surface | Compressions ineffective (surface absorbs force) | Hard, flat surface |

### Child CPR Mistakes

| ❌ Mistake | Why It's Dangerous | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Using 2 fingers (infant technique) | Insufficient compression depth | 1-2 hands (depends on size) |
| Compressing too deep (>2 inches) | Rib fractures | 2 inches (1/3 chest depth) |
| Hands too low (on abdomen) | Liver injury, ineffective compressions | Lower half of breastbone, between nipples |
| Bent arms | Fatigue quickly, inconsistent depth | Straight arms, shoulders over hands |
| Not allowing full recoil | Prevents heart refill, ineffective | Lift hands slightly between compressions |

### Universal Mistakes (All Ages)

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Stopping to check for pulse repeatedly | Only check if obvious signs of life |
| Compressions too slow (<100/min) | Count aloud, maintain rhythm |
| Long interruptions (>10 seconds) | Minimize interruptions |
| Giving up too soon | Continue until help arrives or patient revives |
| Hyperventilating during breaths | 1 second per breath, just until chest rises |

---

## When to Stop CPR

**Continue CPR until:**
1. ✓ Child shows signs of life (breathing, movement, crying, consciousness)
2. ✓ EMS or trained medical personnel take over
3. ✓ AED directs you to stop
4. ✓ Scene becomes unsafe
5. ✓ You are physically unable to continue (exhaustion)

**DO NOT STOP for:**
- ❌ Vomiting (turn head to side, clear mouth, continue)
- ❌ Rib fractures (common and acceptable - effective CPR may break ribs)
- ❌ No improvement after X minutes (continue until help arrives)
- ❌ Someone says "it's been too long" (only doctor can declare death)

**Special case - Hypothermia:**
- Continue CPR during rewarming
- Stop only when warm (>86°F core temp) and still unresponsive

---

## After Successful Resuscitation (Return of Pulse/Breathing)

### Recovery Position

**If child is breathing and has pulse but unconscious:**

1. **Turn child onto side:**
   - Bottom arm extended forward
   - Top knee bent (stabilizes position)
   - Head slightly tilted (keeps airway open)

2. **Monitor continuously:**
   - Breathing can stop again
   - Be ready to restart CPR

3. **Keep warm:**
   - Cover with blanket
   - Hypothermia common after cardiac arrest

4. **Do NOT:**
   - Leave child alone
   - Give food or water (aspiration risk if unconscious)
   - Transport in personal vehicle if EMS available (child can deteriorate during transport)

### Post-Resuscitation Care

**Medical evaluation is MANDATORY:**
- Even if child seems fine
- Cardiac arrest causes organ damage
- May have underlying condition that caused arrest
- Need hospital monitoring (12-24 hours minimum)

**Tell EMS:**
- How long child was unresponsive (your best estimate)
- How many cycles of CPR performed
- Whether AED shocked
- Any obvious cause (choking, drowning, trauma, illness)
- Child's medical history if known

---

## Psychological Impact on Rescuer

**Performing CPR on a child is traumatic** (especially if child doesn't survive).

**Normal reactions:**
- Replaying event mentally
- Nightmares
- Guilt ("What if I did something wrong?")
- Anxiety
- Avoidance of children/similar situations

**What helps:**
- Talking to someone (counselor, trusted person)
- Remembering: You gave child best possible chance
- Understanding: Pediatric cardiac arrest survival is low regardless of CPR quality
- Knowing: You acted when many would freeze

**Seek professional help if:**
- Symptoms worsen over time
- Interfering with daily life
- Suicidal thoughts
- Substance use to cope

**Resources:**
- Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) through EMS agencies
- Counseling referrals through Red Cross
- Mental health professionals specializing in trauma

---

## Training and Certification

**This entry is NOT a substitute for hands-on training.**

**Why hands-on matters:**
- Feel correct compression depth (reading "1.5 inches" ≠ knowing how 1.5 inches feels)
- Practice on manikins (different resistance than human)
- Muscle memory (panic interferes with thinking; trained hands work automatically)
- Feedback from instructors (correct mistakes immediately)

**Recommended courses:**
- **American Heart Association:** Heartsaver Pediatric First Aid CPR AED
- **American Red Cross:** Pediatric First Aid/CPR/AED
- **Duration:** 4-6 hours
- **Certification:** 2 years

**Practice recommendations:**
- Recertify every 2 years (required)
- Review skills every 6 months (self-study)
- Practice on manikins if available (community centers, hospitals offer practice sessions)
