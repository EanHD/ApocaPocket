summary: Setting up hammock and elevated shelter systems for wet or insect-heavy environments.
steps:
- Select two strong, living trees 10-15 feet apart.
- Hang hammock with tree-friendly straps — not thin cord that damages bark.
- Add tarp/rainfly above in catenary curve — ridge line slightly above hammock.
- Add underquilt or pad beneath hammock — bottom insulation critical (compressed insulation
  = none).
- Bug net is essential in tropical/wet environments — tuck fully around hammock.
- Test height and strength before full weight — hang low enough that falls are safe.
warnings:
- Dead trees and dead branches can fall on elevated sleepers.
- Bottom insulation is essential — cold air circulates under hammock, causing hypothermia.
- Hammock failure drops you to ground — always check attachment points.
