summary: Rescue and resuscitation techniques for near-drowning victims.
steps:
- Reach, throw, row — do NOT swim to victim unless trained (drowning people pull rescuers
  under).
- Once out of water, check responsiveness and breathing.
- If not breathing, begin rescue breaths first (5 initial breaths), then standard
  CPR.
- Do not attempt to drain water from lungs (Heimlich on drowning is ineffective/harmful).
- Treat for hypothermia — remove wet clothing, insulate, warm gradually.
- All near-drowning victims need medical evaluation — delayed pulmonary edema can
  occur.
warnings:
- Drowning victims can pull rescuers underwater — use reaching/throwing aids first.
- Secondary drowning (delayed pulmonary edema) can occur hours after rescue.
- Assume spinal injury if diving or high-impact water entry was involved.
- Cold water drowning victims may survive longer — continue CPR for extended period.

## Overview
Rescue and resuscitation techniques for near-drowning victims.

## Step-by-step
1. Reach, throw, row — do NOT swim to victim unless trained (drowning people pull rescuers under).
2. Once out of water, check responsiveness and breathing.
3. If not breathing, begin rescue breaths first (5 initial breaths), then standard CPR.
4. Do not attempt to drain water from lungs (Heimlich on drowning is ineffective/harmful).
5. Treat for hypothermia — remove wet clothing, insulate, warm gradually.
6. All near-drowning victims need medical evaluation — delayed pulmonary edema can occur.

## Warnings
- Drowning victims can pull rescuers underwater — use reaching/throwing aids first.
- Secondary drowning (delayed pulmonary edema) can occur hours after rescue.
- Assume spinal injury if diving or high-impact water entry was involved.
- Cold water drowning victims may survive longer — continue CPR for extended period.
