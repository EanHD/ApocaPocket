summary: Assisting with emergency childbirth when medical facilities are unavailable.
steps:
- Create clean delivery area — wash hands, lay clean cloths/blankets.
- Do not rush or pull the baby — support the head as it emerges.
- Check for cord around neck — if loose, slip over head; if tight, clamp and cut.
- After delivery, keep baby warm (skin-to-skin) and clear airway gently.
- Clamp cord in two places (6 and 8 inches from baby), cut between with sterile blade.
- Placenta will deliver in 5-30 minutes — do not pull on cord. Save placenta for medical
  evaluation.
warnings:
- Hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death — be prepared with clean cloths
  for pressure.
- Breech presentation (feet/buttocks first) is life-threatening — do not attempt to
  turn baby.
- If cord prolapses (comes before baby), position mother with hips elevated — this
  is critical emergency.
- Do not cut cord with unsterile instruments — infection risk is severe.
