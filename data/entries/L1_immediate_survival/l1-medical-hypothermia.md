## Overview
Hypothermia occurs when core body temperature drops below 95°F (35°C). Without treatment, it progresses to cardiac arrest and death. Hypothermia kills more people in moderate climates (30-50°F) than extreme cold, often from wet clothing and wind. Rapid recognition and proper rewarming save lives.

## Definition & Stages

**Normal core temperature:** 98.6°F (37°C)

**Hypothermia stages:**

| Stage | Core Temp | Signs | Mental Status | Shivering |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Mild** | 90-95°F (32-35°C) | Cold skin, shivering, pale | Alert, confused | Strong |
| **Moderate** | 82-90°F (28-32°C) | Weak pulse, slow breathing | Drowsy, irrational | Weak/stops |
| **Severe** | <82°F (<28°C) | Weak/absent pulse, rigid | Unconscious | None |

## Recognition Signs

### Mild Hypothermia (Most Common)
- **Shivering** (intense, uncontrollable)
- Cold, pale skin
- Confusion, poor judgment ("I'm fine!")
- Slurred speech
- Clumsy movements, stumbling
- Fatigue
- Fast breathing, fast heart rate

### Moderate Hypothermia
- **Shivering stops** (critical sign - victim getting worse)
- Blue lips, fingernails
- Drowsiness, apathy
- Irrational behavior (paradoxical undressing - removing clothes)
- Slow, shallow breathing
- Slow, weak pulse
- Loss of coordination

### Severe Hypothermia (Life-Threatening)
- Unconscious or barely responsive
- Rigid muscles
- Very slow or absent pulse (may be hard to detect)
- Very slow or absent breathing
- Dilated pupils
- Skin ice-cold to touch
- **Appears dead** (but may be revivable)

**Critical rule:** "No one is dead until they are warm and dead" - continue CPR until victim reaches hospital

## Step-by-Step Treatment Protocol

### 1. Remove from Cold Environment (Immediate)
- Get victim out of wind, rain, snow
- Move to shelter if possible
- If no shelter: create windbreak with tarp, bodies, rocks
- Get victim off cold ground (insulate with sleeping bag, clothes, branches)

### 2. Prevent Further Heat Loss (First 5 minutes)

**Remove wet clothing:**
- Cut off if needed (don't make victim move)
- Wet clothing conducts heat away 25x faster than dry

**Insulate body:**
- Priority: head, neck, chest, groin (core areas lose heat fastest)
- Use: sleeping bag, blankets, dry clothes, space blanket, anything dry
- Cover head (40% of body heat lost through head)
- Insulate from ground below AND cover above

**Vapor barrier:**
- Place plastic sheet/tarp outside insulation to block wind
- Keeps insulation dry

### 3. Assess Severity (2 minutes)

**Check for:**
- Mental status (alert? confused? unconscious?)
- Shivering (strong? weak? absent?)
- Pulse (present? absent? - check for 30-60 seconds)
- Breathing (normal? slow? absent?)

**Determine treatment level:**
- Mild: Active rewarming + warm fluids
- Moderate: Passive rewarming only, evacuate
- Severe: Gentle handling, CPR if needed, urgent evacuation

### 4. Handle Gently (Critical for Moderate/Severe)

**Why:** Cold heart is VERY irritable - rough movement can trigger fatal cardiac arrest

**Do:**
- Keep victim horizontal (lying down)
- Move slowly, carefully
- Support head/neck
- Avoid jostling

**Do NOT:**
- Stand victim up
- Force victim to walk
- Massage limbs
- Shake or jostle

### 5. Rewarming (Based on Severity)

#### Mild Hypothermia (Alert, Shivering)

**Active rewarming is safe:**

1. **Warm drinks** (if fully alert):
   - Hot, sweet liquids (hot chocolate, sugar water, tea with sugar)
   - 8-12 oz every 15 minutes
   - Do NOT give alcohol (causes vasodilation, worsens hypothermia)
   - Do NOT give caffeine (increases urine output, causes dehydration)

2. **High-energy food:**
   - Chocolate, candy, energy bars
   - Simple carbs for quick energy
   - Fat/protein for sustained energy

3. **Heat sources:**
   - Chemical heat packs to core areas:
     - Neck (carotid arteries)
     - Armpits (axillary arteries)
     - Groin (femoral arteries)
   - **NOT directly on skin** (wrap in cloth)
   - Warm water bottles (100-110°F / 38-43°C)
   - Body-to-body heat (skin-to-skin in sleeping bag)

4. **Light exercise:**
   - Only if fully alert and coordinated
   - Gentle movements (arm circles, leg lifts)
   - Generates internal heat through shivering

#### Moderate Hypothermia (Drowsy, Shivering Stopped)

**Passive rewarming only:**

1. **Insulate aggressively:**
   - Sleeping bag + blankets
   - Head covering
   - Ground insulation
   - Vapor barrier

2. **Body-to-body heat:**
   - Two rescuers, one on each side
   - Skin-to-skin contact inside sleeping bag
   - Focus on core (chest, back)

3. **Do NOT:**
   - ❌ Give anything by mouth (aspiration risk)
   - ❌ Apply direct heat (hot packs, fire) - causes "afterdrop"
   - ❌ Rub or massage limbs
   - ❌ Give alcohol
   - ❌ Allow victim to walk

4. **Monitor closely:**
   - Check pulse/breathing every 5 minutes
   - Watch for further deterioration
   - Be ready to start CPR

5. **Evacuate urgently:**
   - Arrange helicopter rescue if available
   - Carry victim on stretcher (do not let walk)
   - Keep horizontal during transport

#### Severe Hypothermia (Unconscious, No Shivering)

**This is a medical emergency - survival depends on advanced care**

1. **Check for pulse/breathing (60 seconds):**
   - Pulse may be very slow, very weak
   - Breathing may be very shallow
   - Check carotid pulse for full 60 seconds

2. **If pulse present (alive):**
   - Handle EXTREMELY gently
   - Keep horizontal at all times
   - Insulate aggressively
   - Do NOT attempt active rewarming
   - Immediate evacuation
   - Monitor continuously

3. **If no pulse detected:**
   - **Start CPR immediately**
   - Hypothermic hearts can be restarted after hours
   - Continue CPR until:
     - Victim reaches hospital
     - You are physically exhausted
     - Definite signs of death (rigor mortis)
   - Do NOT stop CPR in field

4. **CPR modifications for severe hypothermia:**
   - Check pulse for 60 seconds before starting (slow pulse may exist)
   - Standard compression rate (100-120/min)
   - Standard depth (2-2.4 inches)
   - May feel "stiff" - compress anyway
   - Continue even if appears futile

## Critical DO NOTs

### Do NOT Warm Extremities First
**Why:** "Afterdrop" - cold blood from limbs flows to core, drops core temperature further, can trigger cardiac arrest

**Never:**
- ❌ Place victim's hands/feet near fire
- ❌ Rub or massage arms/legs
- ❌ Put hot packs on hands/feet
- ❌ Immerse limbs in warm water

**Always warm CORE first:**
- ✅ Head, neck, chest, groin
- ✅ Internal (warm fluids) if mild
- ✅ External (heat packs) to trunk only

### Do NOT Give Alcohol
- Causes blood vessels to dilate
- Brings cold blood from periphery to core
- Worsens hypothermia, increases afterdrop risk
- Impairs judgment further

### Do NOT Let Victim "Sleep It Off"
- Hypothermia gets worse, not better, without treatment
- Victim can slip from mild to severe
- Sleep position can obstruct airway
- Keep victim awake and monitored

## Special Situations

### "Paradoxical Undressing"
- Victim removes clothing despite freezing
- Occurs in moderate-severe hypothermia
- Confusion makes victim feel hot
- Prevent if possible, redress immediately

### Immersion Hypothermia (Cold Water)
- Much faster onset than air exposure
- "1-10-1 rule":
  - 1 minute: cold shock, gasping
  - 10 minutes: useful movement
  - 1 hour: unconsciousness
- Get victim out of water immediately
- Remove wet clothes and rewarm
- Monitor for hours (delayed complications)

### Trench Foot / Frostbite with Hypothermia
- Treat hypothermia FIRST
- Do not rewarm frostbitten extremities until core is warm
- Rewarming frostbite while hypothermic is dangerous

### Children & Infants
- Lose heat faster (higher surface area to volume ratio)
- Hypothermia develops more rapidly
- Same treatment principles apply
- Extra insulation critical

### Elderly
- Reduced ability to generate heat (less shivering)
- May develop hypothermia indoors (65-70°F)
- Less obvious signs (may not shiver)
- Higher mortality - treat aggressively

## When to Evacuate

**Immediate evacuation (helicopter if possible):**
- Moderate or severe hypothermia
- Shivering has stopped
- Altered mental status
- Unable to rewarm in field
- Drowsy, irrational, or unconscious

**Can continue journey after rewarming:**
- Mild hypothermia, fully alert
- Strong shivering returned
- Warm, dry clothing available
- Shelter accessible within 1-2 hours

## Prevention (Brief)
- Stay dry (wet = hypothermia)
- Layer clothing (trap air)
- Cover head (major heat loss)
- Eat regularly (fuel for heat)
- Recognize early signs (shivering = act now)

## Critical Measurements
- **Mild hypothermia:** 90-95°F (32-35°C)
- **Moderate:** 82-90°F (28-32°C)
- **Severe:** <82°F (<28°C)
- **Warm fluids temp:** 100-110°F (38-43°C)
- **Heat pack placement:** Core only (neck, armpits, groin)
- **Pulse check duration:** 60 seconds (slow pulse in severe cases)

## Prognosis
- **Mild:** 100% survival with proper treatment
- **Moderate:** 90%+ survival with proper field care + evacuation
- **Severe:** 50-80% survival if CPR started immediately and continued to hospital
- Key: "No one is dead until warm and dead" - people have survived 6+ hours of CPR
