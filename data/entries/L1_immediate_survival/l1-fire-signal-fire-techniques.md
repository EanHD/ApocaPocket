summary: Three fires in a triangle is the international distress signal. A signal fire must produce maximum contrast against the environment — dark smoke against a light sky, bright flame at night. Preparation
  before the rescue aircraft arrives is critical — you may only have seconds to light.
warnings:
- A signal fire that gets out of control can destroy your shelter and supplies — clear a 10-foot firebreak around each signal fire
- Green branches for smoke can produce toxic fumes — stay upwind
- Mirror signaling is visible further than fire in daylight (up to 50 miles) — use mirror first if available
- Three of anything is the universal distress signal — three fires, three gunshots, three whistle blasts
steps:
- 'THREE-FIRE TRIANGLE: build three fire sites in an equilateral triangle, 50-100 feet between each. This is the international distress pattern recognized by all search-and-rescue. Build each fire ready
  to light in seconds — tinder, kindling, and fuel pre-staged.'
- 'DAYTIME SMOKE: maximize smoke contrast against the sky. Against blue/clear sky: use green branches, wet leaves, moss, rubber, or oil to produce DARK/BLACK smoke. Against overcast/gray sky: use dry grass,
  birch bark, or pine needles to produce WHITE/LIGHT smoke.'
- 'NIGHTTIME FIRE: maximize brightness. Dry hardwood produces bright sustained flame. Build fires on elevated ground, hilltops, or clearings visible from the air. A fire is visible 3-10 miles from the air
  depending on size.'
- 'RAPID IGNITION: keep signal fires covered with bark or a tarp to stay dry. Place a fist-sized ball of petroleum-jelly cotton or fatwood shavings at the base of each fire for instant ignition. Practice
  lighting and timing — you need all three fires burning within 60 seconds of hearing an aircraft.'
- 'PLATFORM FIRES: in wet conditions or snow, build signal fires on platforms (raised log frames). This keeps the fire above moisture and makes it visible at greater distance.'
- 'SMOKE COLUMN CONTROL: a tall, straight smoke column is more visible than dispersed smoke. Build a chimney effect by surrounding the fire with a ring of stacked rocks or logs with gaps at the bottom for
  air. The column can be visible 15+ miles on a calm day.'
- 'GROUND-TO-AIR SIGNALS: supplement fires with ground markers — stamp letters in snow, arrange rocks/logs to spell SOS or V (need assistance) in 10+ foot letters. These are visible from search aircraft
  even when fires can''t be maintained.'
- 'TIMING: listen for aircraft. Most searches use grid patterns — the aircraft will pass again. If you hear an engine, light ALL signal fires immediately and add green material for smoke. Stand in the open
  and wave a brightly colored item overhead.'

# Rescue Signal Fire Techniques
