summary: Comprehensive shock identification and treatment for hypovolemic, cardiogenic, distributive (septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic), and obstructive shock with specific interventions.
steps:
- Assess patient's mental status, skin color/temperature, vital signs (pulse, breathing rate, blood pressure if available).
- Recognize shock type based on signs/symptoms and mechanism of injury.
- Treat underlying cause FIRST (stop bleeding, treat allergic reaction, stabilize injuries).
- Position patient appropriately based on shock type and injuries.
- Maintain body temperature - prevent heat loss with blankets, dry clothing.
- Provide oral fluids if conscious and no abdominal injury (unless anaphylaxis - give epinephrine first).
- Reassess vital signs every 5-15 minutes - shock can deteriorate rapidly.
- Monitor airway and breathing continuously - be prepared for CPR.
- Rapid evacuation for all shock states - this is life-threatening emergency.
warnings:
- Shock is ALWAYS life-threatening - even if patient seems stable, they can crash suddenly.
- Internal bleeding causes shock without visible blood loss - suspect with blunt trauma.
- Do NOT elevate legs if head injury, spinal injury, chest injury, or difficulty breathing.
- Never give oral fluids if unconscious, vomiting, or suspected abdominal injury.
- Cardiogenic shock (heart failure) WORSENS with leg elevation - sit patient up instead.
- Children compensate longer than adults - by time they show shock signs, they're critical.

## Overview
Shock is inadequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, resulting in cell death. It's a life-threatening emergency that can occur from bleeding, heart failure, infection, allergic reactions, or spinal injury. **Early recognition and treatment are critical** - survival drops dramatically after 30-60 minutes of untreated shock.

**Key concept:** Shock is NOT about blood pressure alone - it's about inadequate perfusion (blood flow) to organs.

## Types of Shock

| Type | Cause | Primary Problem | Field Recognition |
|------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Hypovolemic** | Blood/fluid loss | Low volume | Bleeding, dehydration, burns |
| **Cardiogenic** | Heart failure | Pump failure | Chest pain, pulmonary edema |
| **Distributive** | Vasodilation | Vessels too wide | Sepsis, spinal injury, anaphylaxis |
| **Obstructive** | Blocked blood flow | Mechanical obstruction | Tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade |

## Recognizing Shock - The "Shock Triad"

### Classic Signs (In Order of Appearance)

| Stage | Mental Status | Skin | Pulse | BP | Breathing | Urine |
|-------|--------------|------|-------|----|-----------| ------|
| **Early (Compensated)** | Anxious, restless | Pale, cool extremities | Fast (>100), normal strength | Normal | Fast (>20) | Reduced |
| **Progressive (Decompensated)** | Confused, lethargic | Pale/gray, cold, clammy | Fast (>120), weak/thready | Low (<90 systolic) | Fast (>30), shallow | Minimal/none |
| **Irreversible (Terminal)** | Unresponsive | Mottled, cold | Very weak/absent | Very low (<70) | Slow/gasping | None |

### Vital Sign Measurements

**Normal adult values:**
- Heart rate: 60-100 beats/min
- Respiratory rate: 12-20 breaths/min
- Blood pressure: 90-140 systolic, 60-90 diastolic
- Mental status: Alert, oriented
- Skin: Warm, dry, pink
- Urine output: >30 mL/hour (1 mL/kg/hr)

**Shock indicators:**
- Heart rate >100 (tachycardia) or weak/thready
- Respiratory rate >20 or <10
- Systolic BP <90 mmHg (or 30 mmHg below baseline)
- Altered mental status (confusion, agitation, lethargy)
- Skin pale/gray, cool, clammy (cold sweat)
- Capillary refill >2 seconds
- Urine output <30 mL/hour

### Quick Assessment Method (No Equipment Needed)

**ABCD approach:**
- **Airway:** Patent? Speaking clearly?
- **Breathing:** Rate >20 or <10? Shallow?
- **Circulation:** Pulse >100? Weak? Capillary refill >2 sec?
- **Disability (mental status):** Alert? Confused? Anxious?

**Capillary refill test:**
1. Press fingernail bed for 5 seconds (turns white)
2. Release and count seconds until returns to pink
3. Normal: <2 seconds
4. Shock: >2 seconds (poor perfusion)

**Radial pulse assessment:**
- Strong radial pulse = systolic BP >80 mmHg (adequate)
- Weak/absent radial pulse = systolic BP <80 mmHg (shock)
- Only carotid pulse = systolic BP <60 mmHg (severe shock)

## Shock by Type - Specific Recognition

### 1. Hypovolemic Shock (Most Common)

**Cause:** Blood or fluid loss
- Hemorrhage (bleeding)
- Severe dehydration (vomiting, diarrhea)
- Burns (plasma loss)
- Heat stroke (fluid loss)

**Key signs:**
- History of bleeding, trauma, or fluid loss
- Classic shock signs (pale, cool, fast pulse)
- Flat neck veins (low volume)
- Thirst

**Blood loss estimation:**

| Class | Blood Loss | Pulse | BP | Mental Status | Skin |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----|--------------|------|
| I | <15% (<750mL) | <100 | Normal | Anxious | Normal |
| II | 15-30% (750-1500mL) | 100-120 | Normal | Mildly anxious | Pale, cool |
| III | 30-40% (1500-2000mL) | 120-140 | Low | Confused | Cold, clammy |
| IV | >40% (>2000mL) | >140 | Very low | Lethargic | Mottled |

### 2. Cardiogenic Shock

**Cause:** Heart failure (MI, arrhythmia, contusion)

**Key signs:**
- Chest pain/pressure
- Difficulty breathing (worse lying flat)
- Jugular vein distension (swollen neck veins)
- Pulmonary edema (pink frothy sputum)
- Shock signs PLUS elevated neck veins

**Critical difference:** Do NOT lay flat or elevate legs - sit patient up!

### 3. Distributive Shock

#### Septic Shock
**Cause:** Severe infection

**Key signs:**
- Fever >38.5°C (101.3°F) or <36°C (96.8°F)
- History of infection/wound
- **Early:** Warm, flushed skin (vasodilation)
- **Late:** Cold, clammy skin (looks like hypovolemic)

#### Neurogenic Shock
**Cause:** Spinal cord injury

**Key signs:**
- History of spinal trauma
- **Warm, dry skin** (no sweating below injury)
- Slow or normal heart rate (paradoxical - should be fast)
- Low blood pressure
- Loss of function below injury level

#### Anaphylactic Shock
**Cause:** Severe allergic reaction

**Key signs:**
- Exposure to allergen (food, bee sting, medication)
- Rapid onset (<30 minutes)
- Hives, itching, swelling
- Difficulty breathing, wheezing
- Swelling of face/tongue/throat
- See l1-medical-allergic-reactions for full treatment

### 4. Obstructive Shock

**Cause:** Physical obstruction of blood flow

**Types:**
- Tension pneumothorax (collapsed lung with pressure)
- Cardiac tamponade (blood around heart)
- Massive pulmonary embolism (clot in lung)

**Key signs:**
- Severe chest injury
- Distended neck veins
- Difficulty breathing
- Shock signs despite no visible bleeding

## Step-by-Step Treatment Protocol

### 1. Scene Safety (10 seconds)
- Ensure scene is safe for you and victim
- Note mechanism of injury

### 2. Initial Assessment (30 seconds)
- Check responsiveness, breathing, pulse
- Perform rapid trauma survey if injured
- Identify obvious bleeding

### 3. Treat Underlying Cause (PRIORITY)

**Stop external bleeding:**
- Direct pressure, tourniquet if needed
- See l1-medical-severe-bleeding

**Anaphylaxis:**
- Epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) 0.3mg IM to thigh
- See l1-medical-allergic-reactions

**Spinal injury:**
- Immobilize spine
- See l1-medical-spinal-precautions

**Burns:**
- Stop burning process, cool appropriately
- See l1-medical-burns

### 4. Position Patient Correctly

**For hypovolemic shock (bleeding, dehydration):**
- Lay flat on back
- Elevate legs 8-12 inches (20-30 cm) above heart
- Use backpack, rolled clothing, logs
- This shifts ~500mL blood to vital organs

**DO NOT elevate legs if:**
- Spinal injury suspected
- Head injury (keep head level or slightly elevated)
- Chest injury or difficulty breathing
- Fractured pelvis or legs
- Cardiogenic shock (sit up instead)
- Abdominal injury with evisceration

**For cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema:**
- Sit patient upright (45-90°)
- Legs down, not elevated
- Reduces fluid returning to overloaded heart

**For spinal injury (neurogenic shock):**
- Keep flat, neutral spine alignment
- Do NOT elevate legs (increases spinal pressure)

### 5. Maintain Body Temperature

**Prevent heat loss:**
- Remove wet clothing
- Place blanket/dry clothing underneath patient
- Cover with blankets, sleeping bags
- Insulate from cold ground
- Protect from wind
- **Do NOT overheat** - goal is prevent hypothermia, not rewarm excessively

**Why it matters:** Hypothermia worsens shock by reducing heart function and clotting

### 6. Provide Fluids (If Appropriate)

**Oral rehydration (if patient meets ALL criteria):**
- Conscious and alert
- Can swallow safely
- No abdominal trauma
- Not vomiting
- Surgery unlikely in next 8 hours

**What to give:**
- Oral rehydration solution (see l1-medical-oral-rehydration-recipe)
- Water with pinch of salt and sugar
- Small sips every few minutes
- Goal: 250-500mL per hour if tolerated

**Do NOT give fluids if:**
- Unconscious or altered mental status
- Vomiting or nausea
- Abdominal injury
- Difficulty swallowing
- Anaphylaxis (give epinephrine FIRST)

### 7. Monitor Continuously

**Check every 5-15 minutes:**
- Mental status (AVPU: Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive)
- Pulse rate and strength
- Respiratory rate
- Skin color/temperature
- Capillary refill

**Document findings:**
- Write times and values on tape/paper attached to patient
- Track trends (improving vs. worsening)

### 8. Prepare for Deterioration

**Be ready to:**
- Start CPR if pulse/breathing stops
- Position for vomiting (recovery position if no spinal injury)
- Reassess and adjust interventions

### 9. Rapid Evacuation

**All shock states require hospital care**
- IV fluids
- Blood transfusion
- Surgery
- Medications
- Advanced monitoring

**Evacuation priority:**
- Immediate: Class III/IV hemorrhage, anaphylaxis, cardiogenic shock
- Urgent: All other shock states
- Time matters: Each hour increases mortality

## Special Populations

### Children

**Critical differences:**
- Compensate MUCH better than adults
- By time they show shock signs, they're in critical state
- Faster heart rates baseline (infants: 120-160, children: 80-120)
- Lower blood pressure baseline
- Need smaller fluid volumes (10-20 mL/kg bolus)

**Pediatric shock signs:**
- Lethargy, decreased playfulness
- Weak cry
- Poor feeding
- Sunken fontanelle (infants)
- No tears when crying

### Pregnant Women (3rd Trimester)

- Uterus compresses major blood vessels when lying flat
- Position on LEFT side (not right) if must lay flat
- Can lose 30-35% blood volume before showing shock signs
- Two patients to consider (mother and fetus)

### Elderly

- Medications (beta-blockers) may prevent fast heart rate
- Less able to compensate
- Baseline blood pressure may be higher (90 systolic may be shock for them)
- More vulnerable to hypothermia

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Waiting for low blood pressure to diagnose shock (late sign)
- ❌ Elevating legs in ALL shock cases (harmful in cardiogenic, spinal, head injury)
- ❌ Giving oral fluids to unconscious or vomiting patient
- ❌ Overheating patient (goal is prevent hypothermia, not active rewarming)
- ❌ Ignoring mental status changes (earliest sign of shock)
- ❌ Not treating underlying cause first
- ❌ Delaying evacuation because patient seems stable
- ❌ Checking blood pressure instead of perfusion signs
- ❌ Missing internal bleeding (no visible blood loss)

## When to Suspect Internal Bleeding

**Mechanism of injury:**
- Fall from height
- High-speed collision
- Blunt trauma to abdomen/chest/pelvis
- Crush injury
- Penetrating trauma

**Signs:**
- Shock without obvious external bleeding
- Abdominal pain, distension, rigidity
- Bruising over abdomen/flanks
- Blood in vomit, stool, urine
- Pelvic instability (DO NOT test - causes more bleeding)

**Action:** Rapid evacuation for surgical control

## Summary Quick Reference

### Shock Recognition Checklist

- [ ] Mental status: Anxious, confused, or lethargic?
- [ ] Pulse: >100, weak, or thready?
- [ ] Breathing: >20 or shallow?
- [ ] Skin: Pale, cold, clammy?
- [ ] Capillary refill: >2 seconds?

**If YES to 2 or more:** Treat for shock

### Treatment Priorities (in order)

1. **Airway/Breathing** - Ensure patent airway
2. **Control bleeding** - Stop external hemorrhage
3. **Position correctly** - Based on shock type
4. **Prevent heat loss** - Keep warm (not hot)
5. **Consider fluids** - If appropriate
6. **Monitor continuously** - Every 5-15 minutes
7. **Evacuate rapidly** - All shock requires hospital

### Position Quick Guide

| Shock Type | Position | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Hypovolemic (bleeding) | Flat + legs up 8-12" | Returns blood to core |
| Cardiogenic (heart) | Sit upright 45-90° | Reduces heart workload |
| Neurogenic (spine) | Flat, neutral spine | Prevents cord damage |
| Anaphylaxis | Flat or semi-reclined | Depends on breathing |
| If in doubt | Flat, monitor closely | Safe default position |

**Never elevate legs if:** Spinal injury, head injury, chest injury, difficulty breathing, fractured pelvis/legs

## Long-Term Field Care (If Evacuation Delayed)

**First 2 hours are critical:**
- Most shock deaths occur in first hour
- Aggressive treatment and monitoring
- Push for fastest possible evacuation

**If stuck >2 hours:**
- Continue oral fluids (if appropriate)
- Maintain body temperature
- Monitor vital signs hourly
- Watch for complications:
  - Acute kidney injury (decreased urine)
  - Multi-organ failure
  - ARDS (lung failure)
  - Coagulopathy (bleeding disorder)

**Reality check:** Shock has high mortality without hospital care. Field care buys time but is NOT definitive treatment.
