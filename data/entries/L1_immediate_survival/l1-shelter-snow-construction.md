summary: Building emergency snow shelters for cold weather survival.
steps:
- 'Quinzhee: pile snow into mound 6+ feet high; let sinter (harden) for 1-2 hours.'
- Insert sticks 12 inches deep as thickness guides; hollow out interior until sticks
  appear.
- 'Snow cave: dig into deep, stable snowbank (not avalanche-prone slope).'
- Create entrance lower than sleeping platform — cold air sinks, warm air stays.
- Poke ventilation hole in roof with stick — maintain this hole at all times.
- Smooth interior ceiling to prevent dripping; insulate floor with boughs or pad.
warnings:
- Ventilation hole is life-critical — carbon dioxide and CO accumulate in sealed snow
  shelters.
- 'Avalanche risk: never build in or below avalanche terrain.'
- Getting wet during construction causes dangerous heat loss — work in layers, avoid
  sweating.
- Mark shelter entrance visibly — snow shelters are invisible from outside.

## Overview
Building emergency snow shelters for cold weather survival.

## Step-by-step
1. Quinzhee: pile snow into mound 6+ feet high; let sinter (harden) for 1-2 hours.
2. Insert sticks 12 inches deep as thickness guides; hollow out interior until sticks appear.
3. Snow cave: dig into deep, stable snowbank (not avalanche-prone slope).
4. Create entrance lower than sleeping platform — cold air sinks, warm air stays.
5. Poke ventilation hole in roof with stick — maintain this hole at all times.
6. Smooth interior ceiling to prevent dripping; insulate floor with boughs or pad.

## Warnings
- Ventilation hole is life-critical — carbon dioxide and CO accumulate in sealed snow shelters.
- Avalanche risk: never build in or below avalanche terrain.
- Getting wet during construction causes dangerous heat loss — work in layers, avoid sweating.
- Mark shelter entrance visibly — snow shelters are invisible from outside.
