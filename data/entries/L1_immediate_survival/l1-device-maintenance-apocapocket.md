# ApocaPocket Device Maintenance & Longevity

## Why This Matters
**This device is your knowledge vault.** In a world where books burn, libraries collapse, and internet dies, the ApocaPocket holds centuries of survival knowledge in your pocket. Protect it. Maintain it. Make it last.

**Target lifespan:** 5-10 years with proper care (battery is limiting factor)
**Realistic:** 3-5 years under harsh field conditions
**Possible:** 10+ years with meticulous maintenance and battery replacement

## Battery Care (Lithium-Ion Best Practices)

### The Science
**Lithium-ion batteries degrade through:**
- Charge cycles (every 0-100% is 1 cycle)
- Deep discharge (below 10% damages cells)
- High charge (100% constant = stress)
- Heat (accelerates chemical breakdown)
- Time (even unused batteries age)

**Best practices extend lifespan 2-3x.**

### Optimal Charging Strategy

#### The 20-80 Rule
**Best for longevity:** Keep battery between 20-80%

**Why:**
- **Below 20%:** Deep discharge stresses cells (capacity loss)
- **Above 80%:** High voltage stresses cells (faster aging)
- **Sweet spot:** 40-60% for long-term storage

**Trade-off:** Less runtime per charge, but battery lasts years longer

**Implementation:**
- Charge when drops to 20-30%
- Stop charging at 75-80%
- Don't leave plugged in at 100% overnight

#### Full Discharge Myths
**OLD advice (NiCad batteries):** Fully discharge to prevent "memory effect"
**NEW reality (Li-ion):** Deep discharge HARMS the battery

**Guideline:**
- **Never** let it die completely if avoidable
- **Emergency:** If it reaches 0%, charge ASAP (don't store dead)
- **Calibration:** Full 0-100% cycle once every 3 months (for accurate % reading)

#### Charging Speed
**Slow charge > Fast charge for longevity**

**If you have choice:**
- Slow charge (0.5A): Gentle, less heat, better for battery
- Fast charge (2A): Convenient, generates heat, ages battery faster

**Heat during charging is the enemy.** Remove case, charge in cool location, don't use device while charging.

### Temperature Management

#### Ideal Operating Range
**Sweet spot:** 60-70°F (15-21°C)
**Acceptable:** 32-95°F (0-35°C)
**Danger zone:** Below 32°F or above 95°F

**Cold weather (<32°F):**
- Battery capacity drops temporarily (recovers when warm)
- Don't charge when frozen (can damage cells)
- Keep device in inner pocket (body heat)
- Warm slowly before use (don't heat quickly)

**Hot weather (>95°F):**
- Accelerated aging (permanent capacity loss)
- Avoid direct sunlight
- Don't leave in hot vehicle
- Shade + ventilation critical

#### Storage Temperature
**Short-term (days-weeks):** Room temperature OK
**Long-term (months):** Cool and dry (50-60°F ideal)

**Critical:** If storing for months:
- Charge to 40-60% (not full, not empty)
- Power off completely
- Check every 3 months, top up to 50% if needed
- Cool, dry location (basement, not attic)

### Battery Lifespan Expectations

**Typical degradation:**
- Year 1: 100% capacity
- Year 2: 90-95% capacity
- Year 3: 80-90% capacity
- Year 4: 70-80% capacity
- Year 5: 60-70% capacity

**With optimal care:**
- Year 1: 100%
- Year 3: 90%
- Year 5: 80%
- Year 7: 70%
- Year 10: 60% (still usable)

**Signs of degradation:**
- Faster drain (shorter runtime)
- Slower charge
- Heat during use
- Sudden shutdowns
- Swelling (DANGER: stop using immediately)

## Storage: Protect from Environment

### Environmental Threats

#### Water/Humidity
**Damage:** Corrosion, short circuits, screen damage
**Prevention:**
- Waterproof case (Otterbox, Pelican, or DIY)
- Silica gel packets in storage container
- Dry immediately if wet (see Water Damage section)

**Field carry:** Ziplock bag (cheap, effective, replaceable)

#### Dust/Dirt
**Damage:** Button wear, port blockage, screen scratches
**Prevention:**
- Case with port covers
- Screen protector (tempered glass or film)
- Brush ports/buttons regularly (soft brush)

**Field use:** Keep in case when not actively using

#### Impact/Shock
**Damage:** Cracked screen, loose connections, component failure
**Prevention:**
- Protective case (rubber/silicone absorbs shock)
- Lanyard or wrist strap (prevent drops)
- Padded storage (wrap in cloth, foam insert)

**Critical:** Screen is most vulnerable. Screen protector + case mandatory for field use.

#### Sun/UV
**Damage:** Screen degradation, plastic brittleness, overheating
**Prevention:**
- Avoid prolonged direct sunlight
- Store in shade/case when not in use
- UV-resistant case material (some plastics yellow/crack)

### Optimal Storage Conditions

**Short-term (daily/weekly):**
- Hard case or protective sleeve
- Elevated (off ground, away from moisture)
- Accessible (you'll actually use it)

**Long-term (months):**
- Waterproof container (ammo can, Pelican case)
- Silica gel packets (absorb humidity)
- Cool location (60-70°F)
- Dark (protect screen from UV)
- Charge to 50%, check quarterly

**Cache storage (emergency backup):**
- Multiple layers: Ziplock → hard case → ammo can
- Desiccant (silica gel, rice as backup)
- Buried or hidden location (temperature stable)
- Document location (you need to find it later)
- Check annually (verify condition, update data)

## SD Card Backup (Critical!)

### Why Redundancy Matters
**SD cards fail.** Not if, but when. Heat, corruption, wear, physical damage all kill cards.

**Your knowledge must outlive any single piece of hardware.**

### Backup Strategy

#### 3-2-1 Rule
- **3 copies** minimum (primary + 2 backups)
- **2 different media** (SD card + USB drive, or 2 SD cards + cloud)
- **1 offsite** (different physical location)

**Example:**
- **Copy 1:** In device (daily use)
- **Copy 2:** Backup SD card in bug-out bag
- **Copy 3:** Backup SD card in cache 1km away

#### Backup Schedule
**After major updates:** Immediately backup
**Routine:** Monthly full backup
**Verification:** Quarterly (test that backups actually work)

#### How to Backup
1. **Remove SD card** from device (power off first)
2. **Insert into computer** (USB adapter or built-in reader)
3. **Copy entire contents** to computer
4. **Write to backup SD card** (identical copy)
5. **Verify** (compare file sizes, spot-check files open correctly)
6. **Label and date** backup card (permanent marker on card)
7. **Store safely** (separate from primary card)

**No computer? Manual backup:**
- Keep written index of most critical entries
- Copy key files to second device (if available)
- Memorize locations of critical information

### SD Card Care
**Lifespan:** 5-10 years typical, but can fail suddenly

**Best practices:**
- Quality cards (SanDisk, Samsung—avoid cheap no-name)
- Proper ejection (don't pull out while writing)
- Avoid extreme temperatures
- Keep contacts clean (soft cloth, isopropyl alcohol if needed)
- Store in protective case (not loose in pocket)

**Warning signs:**
- Slow read/write speeds
- Corruption errors
- Files disappearing
- Device doesn't recognize card

**If card shows warning signs:** Backup immediately, replace card.

## Screen Protection

### Screen Protector (Highly Recommended)
**Options:**
- **Tempered glass:** Best protection, clear, feels like glass
- **Plastic film:** Good protection, cheaper, more scratch-prone
- **DIY:** Clear packing tape (emergency measure, not ideal)

**Installation:**
1. Clean screen thoroughly (microfiber cloth)
2. Remove dust (sticky side of tape, gentle dabs)
3. Align protector
4. Apply from one edge (push out bubbles as you go)
5. Smooth with card or cloth

**Replacement:** When scratched/cracked (protector sacrificial, saves actual screen)

### Hard Case
**Purpose:** Impact protection, scratch prevention, waterproofing

**Features to look for:**
- Raised bezel (screen doesn't touch surface when face-down)
- Port covers (keep out dust/water)
- Grippy texture (prevent drops)
- Shock absorption (rubber or silicone inserts)

**Trade-off:** Bulkier, but device survives. Worth it.

## Button Maintenance

### Keep Clean
**Dirt = stuck buttons, wear, failure**

**Cleaning:**
1. Power off device
2. Soft brush (toothbrush, paintbrush)
3. Compressed air (if available) or blow gently
4. Slightly damp cloth (not wet) around buttons
5. Dry completely before powering on

**Frequency:** Monthly, or when buttons feel sticky/crunchy

### Check for Wear
**Symptoms of button failure:**
- Mushy feel (used to click, now soft)
- No response (press doesn't register)
- Stuck (button stays depressed)
- Double-press (one press triggers twice)

**If buttons failing:**
- **Short-term:** Use less, rely on touch screen if available
- **Long-term:** Replace button assembly (requires disassembly, see Replacement Parts)

## Firmware Updates

### When to Update
**If working:** Don't fix what isn't broken
**If bugs/issues:** Update may resolve
**If new critical features:** Consider update

**Risk:** Update can brick device if interrupted or corrupted

### How to Update (Typical Process)
1. **Backup everything** (SD card, settings, data)
2. **Charge to 100%** (never update on low battery)
3. **Download firmware** (from official source, verify checksum)
4. **Copy to device** (usually specific folder/filename)
5. **Initiate update** (follow device-specific instructions)
6. **Do not interrupt** (don't power off, be patient)
7. **Verify** (device boots, functions work)

### If Update Fails (Reflash Procedure)
**Symptoms:** Won't boot, stuck on logo, errors

**Recovery (if device supports):**
1. **Enter bootloader mode** (usually hold button combo while powering on)
2. **Connect to computer** (USB)
3. **Flash firmware** (using device-specific tool)
4. **Wait for completion** (can take 5-15 minutes)
5. **Reboot**

**Prevention:**
- Keep backup of working firmware (.uf2 or .bin file)
- Keep firmware file on multiple SD cards
- Document reflash procedure (write it down)

## Power Troubleshooting

### Won't Turn On

**Check:**
1. **Battery dead?** → Charge for 30 min, try again
2. **Charge port dirty?** → Clean with toothpick (gently), try again
3. **Charger working?** → Test with different device, or different charger
4. **Battery fully discharged?** → Leave on charger for 2+ hours (deep discharge recovery)
5. **Power button stuck?** → Press firmly several times, check for obstruction

**If still dead:**
- Open device (if possible), check battery connection
- Measure battery voltage (multimeter: should be 3.0-4.2V)
- Try external power (if device supports USB power without battery)

### Won't Charge

**Check:**
1. **Cable connection?** → Firmly seated, try different cable
2. **Port dirty?** → Clean carefully (compressed air, toothpick)
3. **Charger working?** → Test on other device
4. **Battery temperature?** → Too cold or hot (wait to normalize)
5. **Charge indicator?** → Any LED or screen response?

**If charging slow/intermittent:**
- Connector damaged (bent pins, loose port)
- Cable damage (try different cable first)
- Port repair needed (re-solder connections)

## Display Issues

### Screen Problems

**Lines on screen:**
- **Cause:** Loose connection, damaged ribbon cable
- **Fix:** Disassemble, reseat display connector, check ribbon cable

**Dead pixels:**
- **Cause:** Manufacturing defect or physical damage
- **Fix:** Usually permanent (can try pixel-fixing apps, limited success)
- **Workaround:** If minor, ignore (doesn't spread)

**Dim screen:**
- **Cause:** Backlight failure, low brightness setting, power saving mode
- **Fix:** Check brightness setting first, then backlight (requires repair/replacement)

**Flickering:**
- **Cause:** Loose connection, failing backlight, firmware issue
- **Fix:** Reseat connections, update firmware, replace backlight

**Touch not responding:**
- **Cause:** Screen protector interference, digitizer failure, firmware glitch
- **Fix:** Remove screen protector, reboot device, recalibrate touch (if option exists)

## Water Damage (Emergency Response)

### Immediate Actions (First 5 Minutes)
**Every second counts. Don't panic. Act.**

1. **Power off immediately** (hold power button, force shutdown)
   - Even if seems fine (water + electricity = corrosion)
2. **Remove from water source** (obvious, but state it)
3. **Remove case, SD card, any accessories**
4. **Shake gently** (get bulk water out, don't shake violently)
5. **Dab with cloth** (absorb surface water, don't wipe into ports)

**DO NOT:**
- Turn on to "test" (patience saves device)
- Use heat (hair dryer, oven, sun) – damages components
- Shake violently (internal damage)
- Panic-press buttons (pushes water inside)

### Drying Process (24-72 Hours)

#### Method 1: Rice (Common, Okay)
1. Fill container with uncooked rice
2. Bury device completely
3. Seal container (lid, plastic wrap)
4. Wait 48 hours minimum (72 hours better)
5. Check for moisture (look in ports, seams)

**Why rice:** Mild desiccant, absorbs humidity
**Limitation:** Dust gets in ports, not as effective as silica gel

#### Method 2: Silica Gel (Better)
1. Collect silica gel packets (from packaging, etc.)
2. Place device in container surrounded by packets
3. Seal container
4. Wait 48-72 hours
5. Check for moisture

**Why better:** Stronger desiccant, no dust, reusable (dry out in sun)

#### Method 3: Forced Air (Best if Available)
1. Place in front of fan (not heater)
2. Gentle airflow for 48+ hours
3. Rotate device periodically
4. Combine with silica gel for maximum effect

**Why best:** Active moisture removal, even drying

### Testing After Drying
**Patience. You waited 48 hours. Wait 48 more if uncertain.**

1. **Visual inspection:** Any remaining moisture visible?
2. **Smell test:** Musty/moldy smell? (not fully dry)
3. **Weight test:** Heavier than normal? (water inside)
4. **Battery test:** Remove battery, check for corrosion
5. **Power test:** If all above OK, try powering on

**If powers on:**
- Test all functions (screen, buttons, charging, SD card)
- Monitor for 24 hours (some failures delayed)
- If works fully, you got lucky (still may corrode over time)

**If doesn't power on:**
- Re-dry another 48 hours
- Disassemble (if comfortable), check for corrosion
- Clean with isopropyl alcohol (90%+, not water)
- Seek repair (if worth it and possible)

### Prevention > Cure
- Waterproof case for field use
- Ziplock bag (cheap, effective)
- Keep in inner pocket (away from rain)
- Don't use near water (shore, boat, rain)
