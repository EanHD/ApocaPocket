# Children in Disasters - Psychological Response and Support

## Overview

**Children process trauma differently than adults.** Their developing brains cannot rationalize danger, contextualize loss, or self-regulate emotions. Without proper support, disaster trauma causes lasting psychological damage: PTSD, developmental delays, behavioral disorders.

**Key principle:** Children look to adults for safety cues. If adults appear terrified, children assume they are in mortal danger. **Your calm is their calm.**

**This entry covers:** Age-appropriate communication, recognizing trauma responses, maintaining routine, separation anxiety management, and when professional help is needed.

**Survival context:** In disasters, physical needs (food, water, shelter) are obvious. Psychological needs are equally critical but often overlooked until damage is done.

## Age-Specific Disaster Responses

### Infants (0-2 Years)

**Cognitive abilities:**
- No understanding of danger or disaster concepts
- Cannot verbalize feelings
- Memory limited (won't "remember" event but trauma stored in nervous system)
- Primary need: physical contact with caregiver

**Typical disaster responses:**
- Increased crying, fussiness
- Clinging to caregiver
- Sleep disruption
- Feeding problems (refusing to eat or comfort eating)
- Regression (losing recently acquired skills)
- Irritability when separated from caregiver

**What they need:**
- **Constant physical contact** (skin-to-skin when possible)
- Predictable feeding/sleep schedule (even in chaos)
- Calm caregiver presence
- Protection from sensory overload (loud noises, bright lights, crowds)
- Familiar object (blanket, toy) if available

**How to communicate:**
- Soft, calm voice tone (content doesn't matter, tone is everything)
- Gentle touch, rocking, holding
- Maintain eye contact during feeding/care
- Minimize exposure to frightening scenes (cover their eyes/ears)

---

### Toddlers (2-5 Years)

**Cognitive abilities:**
- Understand danger is present but not why or when it will end
- Believe they caused the disaster (magical thinking: "I was bad, so earthquake happened")
- Cannot distinguish reality from imagination
- Limited language to express fear

**Typical disaster responses:**
- **Regression:** Thumb sucking, bedwetting, baby talk
- Separation anxiety (panic when caregiver out of sight)
- Nightmares, fear of dark, refusal to sleep alone
- Tantrums (increased frequency and intensity)
- Repetitive play (acting out disaster scenarios)
- Loss of appetite or overeating
- Aggression toward siblings/peers

**What they need:**
- **Physical proximity to caregiver** (within eyesight at all times)
- Simple, honest explanations (1-2 sentences maximum)
- Permission to express fear without shame
- Routine and predictability
- Safe outlet for feelings (play, drawing, movement)

**How to communicate:**

**DO:**
- ✓ Use simple words: "The ground shook. It's over now. We are safe."
- ✓ Validate feelings: "You're scared. That makes sense. I'm here with you."
- ✓ Concrete reassurance: "I will keep you safe. I will not leave you."
- ✓ Let them ask questions (answer simply, don't over-explain)
- ✓ Physical reassurance: Hugs, lap sitting, hand-holding

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Complex explanations: "Tectonic plates shifted causing seismic waves..."
- ❌ Minimize feelings: "You're fine, stop crying."
- ❌ Lie: "Nothing bad will happen" (they won't trust you)
- ❌ Expose to media coverage (TV/phone disaster footage traumatizes)
- ❌ Promises you can't keep: "We'll be home tomorrow" (if uncertain)

**Example script for major disaster:**
> "There was [earthquake/fire/storm]. It was scary and loud. It's over now. You are safe. I am here. I will take care of you. We will stay together."

Repeat as needed. Toddlers need repetition for processing.

---

### School-Age Children (6-12 Years)

**Cognitive abilities:**
- Understand cause-and-effect
- Capable of abstract thought (can imagine worst-case scenarios)
- Developing sense of mortality ("Can I die? Can you die?")
- May understand disaster but not personal risk level

**Typical disaster responses:**
- **Hypervigilance:** Constantly checking for danger, startling easily
- Worry about future disasters ("Will it happen again?")
- Guilt/responsibility ("I should have saved...") 
- Academic performance decline
- Social withdrawal or clinginess
- Physical complaints (headaches, stomachaches with no medical cause)
- Risk-taking behavior (testing boundaries)
- Anger outbursts
- Sleep disturbances (nightmares, insomnia)

**What they need:**
- **Honest, age-appropriate information** (fills gaps imagination creates with worst-case scenarios)
- Sense of control (tasks, responsibilities, choices)
- Routine and structure
- Peer interaction (if safe)
- Physical activity (burns stress hormones)
- Emotional validation without judgment

**How to communicate:**

**DO:**
- ✓ Provide facts: "The hurricane hit our town. Our house was damaged. We are staying here until repairs are done."
- ✓ Acknowledge reality: "This is hard. I'm sad too. We will get through it together."
- ✓ Answer questions honestly: "I don't know when we can go home. I'll tell you as soon as I know."
- ✓ Give them roles: "I need your help keeping your brother calm. Can you do that?"
- ✓ Discuss feelings regularly: "What's the hardest part for you right now?"

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Graphic details: "Bodies everywhere..." (causes intrusive images)
- ❌ Adult worries: "I don't know how we'll pay for this..." (they can't help, only worry)
- ❌ Forcing discussion: "You need to talk about it" (respect their pace)
- ❌ Comparing their reaction: "Your sister isn't scared..." (invalidating)

**Example script for loss (home/possessions):**
> "Our house was destroyed in the fire. We lost many things we loved. That's really sad. It's okay to feel sad, angry, or scared. I feel those things too. We are alive and together - that's what matters most. We will rebuild our life."

---

### Adolescents (13-18 Years)

**Cognitive abilities:**
- Fully understand disaster scope and implications
- Capable of abstract and future-oriented thinking
- Developing identity (disaster disrupts sense of self)
- Peer relationships central to wellbeing

**Typical disaster responses:**
- **Risk-taking behavior:** Reckless actions, substance use (numbing pain)
- Withdrawal from family (isolating in room, refusing to talk)
- Excessive worry about future ("Will I still go to college?")
- Anger toward authority (blaming government, rescuers, parents)
- Numbness/apathy ("I don't care about anything")
- Physical complaints, psychosomatic illness
- Academic decline
- Survivor guilt (especially if peers/family died)
- Depression, suicidal ideation (in severe cases)

**What they need:**
- **Respect for autonomy** (involve in decisions when possible)
- Peer connection (critical for this age)
- Opportunities to help (gives sense of purpose)
- Privacy (balanced with monitoring for dangerous behavior)
- Validation of complex emotions
- Honest communication (they can handle truth)

**How to communicate:**

**DO:**
- ✓ Treat as partner: "I need to make decisions about our living situation. What are your thoughts?"
- ✓ Acknowledge their perspective: "You're right, this sucks. It's unfair."
- ✓ Be transparent: "I'm stressed too. I'm doing my best."
- ✓ Respect privacy: "I'm here if you want to talk. I won't force you."
- ✓ Connect them with peers: "Let's find a way for you to see your friends."

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Talk down: "You're too young to understand..."
- ❌ Dismiss concerns: "Your phone doesn't matter right now" (social connection matters deeply to them)
- ❌ Overburden: "You're the man of the house now" (unfair pressure)
- ❌ Ignore warning signs: Withdrawal + mood change + risk behavior = intervention needed

**Example script for major disruption (evacuation, relocation):**
> "We have to evacuate and don't know when we can return. I know this disrupts your school, friends, and plans. That's a huge deal - I take it seriously. We'll figure out how to maintain your connections. Your input matters in our decisions. This is hard for all of us."

---

## Trauma Response Stages

### Stage 1: Acute (0-48 Hours)

**Common reactions across all ages:**
- Shock, numbness, disbelief
- Denial ("This isn't happening")
- Hyperactivity or lethargy
- Physical complaints (nausea, headache)
- Confusion, disorientation
- Exaggerated startle response

**Adult response:**
- Maintain physical safety
- Meet basic needs (food, water, warmth)
- Provide constant reassurance
- Limit exposure to disaster scene/media
- Stay calm (your emotion regulation teaches theirs)

---

### Stage 2: Short-Term (3 Days - 4 Weeks)

**Common reactions:**
- Sleep disturbances (nightmares, insomnia, sleeping too much)
- Appetite changes
- Mood swings
- Regression to younger behaviors
- Separation anxiety increases
- Somatic complaints (headache, stomachache)
- Difficulty concentrating
- Repetitive play/talking about event (processing)

**Adult response:**
- Establish routine as much as possible
- Encourage expression through play, art, talking
- Maintain physical closeness
- Monitor but don't force discussions
- Normalize reactions: "Your body is reacting to something scary. That's normal."

---

### Stage 3: Long-Term Recovery (1-12+ Months)

**Expected trajectory:**
- Gradual decrease in symptoms (month over month)
- Occasional setbacks (triggers, anniversaries, new stressors)
- Return to baseline functioning (though changed by experience)

**Concerning signs (not improving or worsening):**
- Persistent nightmares (no decrease after 3 months)
- Avoidance of reminders (becoming more severe)
- Hypervigilance not diminishing
- Developmental regression not reversing
- New concerning behaviors (self-harm, aggression, substance use)

**When to seek professional help:** See section below.

---

## Separation Anxiety Management

**Why separation anxiety intensifies in disasters:**
- Survival instinct (brain recognizes danger, fears abandonment)
- Loss of predictability (if familiar world collapsed, what else can?)
- Previous separations (if parent disappeared during disaster, brain fears recurrence)

### Separation Anxiety by Age

| Age | Normal Reaction | Concerning Reaction |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| 0-2 years | Crying when caregiver leaves sight, calms within 15 min | Inconsolable for 30+ min, refusal to eat when separated |
| 2-5 years | Clinginess, asking where parent is frequently | Panic attacks, vomiting, complete shutdown when separated |
| 6-12 years | Wanting parent nearby, checking in frequently | Unable to attend school/activities, physical illness when separated |
| 13-18 years | Mild worry, checking phone frequently | Panic attacks, unable to function, refusing to leave home |

### Management Strategies

**For necessary separations (bathroom, gathering supplies):**

1. **Tell them you're leaving (don't sneak away):**
   - "I need to go get water. I will be back in 10 minutes."

2. **Give concrete timeframe:**
   - Use visual timer if available
   - "By the time you finish this snack, I'll be back."

3. **Designate substitute caregiver:**
   - "Stay with [trusted person]. They will keep you safe while I'm gone."

4. **Leave comfort object:**
   - "Hold my jacket while I'm gone. It smells like me."

5. **Follow through reliably:**
   - Return when promised (builds trust)
   - If delayed, send message if possible

**For extended separations (parent injury, separate evacuation):**

**Preparation (if time allows):**
- Explain clearly: "I am hurt and need to go to hospital. Aunt Sarah will take care of you. I will come back as soon as doctors say I can."
- Provide timeline (even if uncertain): "Probably 2-3 days. I will send messages."
- Give transitional object (photo, clothing, written note)
- Introduce substitute caregiver properly (not a stranger)

**If separation is sudden/unplanned:**
- Reunite as soon as possible
- Expect heightened anxiety afterward (normal trauma response)
- Provide extra physical contact and reassurance
- Don't punish regressive behavior (temporary)

---

## Routine Maintenance in Chaos

**Why routine matters:**
Children's brains rely on predictability for security. When the external world is chaotic, routine provides internal structure.

### Priority Routines to Maintain

**Essential (maintain even in extreme conditions):**
1. **Wake/sleep times** (within 1 hour of normal)
2. **Meal times** (even if food is different, timing provides structure)
3. **Bedtime routine** (abbreviated version if needed)

**Important (maintain if possible):**
4. **Hygiene routine** (tooth brushing, face washing)
5. **Quiet/active time alternation** (prevent overstimulation)
6. **Connection time** (one-on-one attention, even 10 minutes)

**Helpful (if resources allow):**
7. **Learning activities** (reading, educational games)
8. **Physical activity** (structured play, exercise)
9. **Social interaction** (peer contact if safe)

### Creating New Routine in Disaster Setting

**If pre-disaster routine is impossible, create new temporary routine:**

**Example disaster shelter routine:**

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 7:00 AM | Wake up, face wash, get dressed | Normalcy, dignity |
| 7:30 AM | Breakfast together | Nutrition, family connection |
| 8:00 AM | Educational activity (reading, games) | Mental stimulation, distraction |
| 9:00 AM | Physical activity (walk, play) | Stress release, health |
| 10:00 AM | Free play / creativity (drawing, building) | Emotional expression, control |
| 12:00 PM | Lunch | Nutrition, structure |
| 1:00 PM | Quiet time (rest, reading) | Regulation, processing |
| 3:00 PM | Helping tasks (age-appropriate chores) | Purpose, competence |
| 5:00 PM | Dinner | Nutrition, family connection |
| 6:00 PM | Family time (stories, talking, games) | Security, bonding |
| 7:00 PM | Bedtime routine (simplified) | Sleep preparation |
| 7:30 PM | Lights out | Rest, recovery |

**Adapt based on age, space, and resources. Consistency matters more than specific activities.**

---

## Bedtime Routine in Disaster Conditions

**Why sleep is critical:**
- Brain processes trauma during sleep
- Growth hormone released during sleep (physical recovery)
- Emotional regulation depends on sleep
- Memory consolidation

**Common sleep disruptions post-disaster:**
- Nightmares (replaying trauma)
- Fear of dark (association with danger)
- Insomnia (hypervigilance)
- Bedwetting (stress response)
- Refusal to sleep alone

### Simplified Bedtime Protocol (15-20 Minutes)

**Goal:** Signal to body that it's safe to sleep (even if environment is not ideal)

**Steps:**

1. **Consistent time** (±30 minutes)
   - Even if "bedtime" is earlier/later than normal, keep it consistent

2. **Physical calming** (5 minutes)
   - Quiet activity (no running, wrestling, rough play)
   - Gentle stretching, slow breathing
   - Dim lights if possible (or face away from light)

3. **Connection** (5 minutes)
   - Talk about day (focus on positives: "What's one thing that went okay today?")
   - Reassurance: "You are safe. I am here. I will keep you safe through the night."
   - Physical affection (hug, back rub, hand-holding)

4. **Transitional object** (if available)
   - Familiar toy, blanket, or clothing item
   - If nothing familiar, designate new object: "This is your sleeping buddy."

5. **Predictable end**
   - "Goodnight, I love you, see you in the morning."
   - Leave slowly (don't rush, don't sneak)
   - If sharing sleep space, settle yourself visibly

**For nightmares:**
- Respond quickly (don't let them wake fully in terror)
- Calm reassurance: "You had a scary dream. It's not real. You're safe."
- Physical comfort (holding, rocking)
- Stay until calm
- Morning: "Do you remember your dream?" (process if they want to talk)

**For fear of dark:**
- Small light source if possible (candle in safe container, glow stick, phone on low brightness)
- Your presence: "I'm right here. You can reach out and touch me."
- Explain shadows: "That's just [object]. It looks different in low light but it's the same [object]."

**For refusal to sleep alone (previously independent child):**
- Allow temporary regression (short-term co-sleeping acceptable in crisis)
- Gradual transition back to independence when situation stabilizes
- Don't force separation if child is in acute distress (damages trust)

---

## Helping Children Feel Useful

**Why this matters:**
- Sense of control reduces helplessness
- Purpose reduces anxiety
- Competence builds self-esteem
- Distraction from trauma thoughts

### Age-Appropriate Tasks

**Ages 2-5:**
- Sort items (socks, utensils, supplies)
- Hand items to adult
- Comfort younger sibling (under supervision)
- Simple cleanup (put toys in bin)
- Fetch items ("Can you bring me the water bottle?")

**Ages 6-9:**
- Distribute supplies (water, food)
- Care for younger children (reading stories, playing)
- Simple food prep (unwrapping, mixing)
- Organizing supplies
- Message delivery (within safe area)

**Ages 10-12:**
- Meal preparation (with supervision)
- Childcare (shorter periods)
- First aid assistance (holding supplies, fetching items)
- Inventory tracking (counting supplies)
- Physical labor (appropriate to strength: carrying light items, sweeping)

**Ages 13-18:**
- Nearly adult-level tasks (with guidance)
- Supervising younger children
- Cooking
- Supply runs (if area is secure)
- Community support tasks
- Decision-making input

**Important:** 
- Tasks should be genuinely helpful (not busy work)
- Provide clear instructions
- Praise effort and completion
- Don't overburden (they're still processing trauma too)

---

## Emotional Expression Outlets

**Why children need this:**
- Limited verbal skills (especially younger children)
- Emotions are body-based (need physical release)
- Play is children's natural language

### Non-Verbal Expression Methods

**Drawing/Art:**
- Provide paper and pencil/crayons if available
- Don't interpret or judge ("Tell me about this" vs "Why is this scary?")
- Let them draw disaster scene if they want (processing)
- Display their art (validates their experience)

**Play:**
- Repetitive disaster play is normal (acting out earthquake, evacuation)
- Provide props (blocks, sticks, whatever available)
- Join if invited, but let child lead
- Don't stop disaster play unless it's harming someone

**Movement:**
- Running, jumping, climbing (safe areas)
- Dancing, spinning
- Carrying, lifting (heavy work regulates nervous system)
- Throwing (soft objects at safe target)

**Music:**
- Singing (familiar songs provide comfort)
- Humming, whistling
- Rhythmic clapping, drumming
- Making simple instruments (shakers from containers)

**Storytelling:**
- Tell story of disaster from child's perspective ("Once there was a brave child who...")
- Read books (any available - predictable endings are comforting)
- Make up stories together

---

## When to Seek Professional Mental Health Support

**Immediate referral needed (if available):**
- Suicidal statements or behavior
- Self-harm
- Harm to others (beyond normal sibling conflict)
- Psychosis (hallucinations, delusions)
- Complete inability to function (won't eat, speak, move)
- Dissociation (seems "not there," doesn't respond to name)

**Referral recommended (within 4-6 weeks if symptoms persist):**
- No improvement in symptoms after 1 month
- Worsening symptoms
- Developmental regression not reversing
- School refusal (when school available)
- Nightmares 3+ times per week
- Panic attacks
- Extreme avoidance (won't go near anything related to disaster)
- Physical symptoms with no medical cause (ongoing)

**Normal trauma reactions (do NOT need professional help immediately):**
- Sadness, crying
- Anger, irritability
- Clinginess
- Mild sleep disturbances
- Temporary regression
- Repetitive play/talking about event
- Mild difficulty concentrating
- Increased worry

**Timeline:** Most children show significant improvement within 4-8 weeks with supportive caregiving. If not improving by 8 weeks, professional help beneficial.

---

## Supporting Children When You're Traumatized Too

**Reality check:** Adults in disasters are also traumatized. You cannot be perfectly calm. **That's okay.**

**What children need:** Adults who are *trying* to cope, not perfect coping.

**Strategies:**

**Be honest (age-appropriately):**
- "I'm sad too. I'm taking care of myself so I can take care of you."
- NOT: Graphic details of your trauma thoughts

**Model healthy coping:**
- "I'm going to take some deep breaths. Want to breathe with me?"
- Take breaks (even 5 minutes alone in bathroom)
- Physical self-care (eating, sleeping when possible)

**Ask for help:**
- Share childcare with others if available
- Accept support from relief workers
- Tag-team with partner if present (you rest, they supervise, then switch)

**What doesn't help:**
- ❌ Pretending you're fine (children sense inauthenticity)
- ❌ Emotional dumping on children (they become your therapist)
- ❌ Collapsing completely (children need one functional adult)

**Minimum functional level:** If you can meet children's basic needs (food, safety, sleep) and provide periodic emotional reassurance, you're doing enough. You don't need to be emotionally perfect.

---

## Cultural Considerations

**Disaster response varies by culture:**
- Expression of emotion (crying accepted/encouraged vs. stoicism valued)
- Gender roles (who comforts children)
- Authority/hierarchy (who makes decisions)
- Spiritual/religious coping (prayer, rituals)
- Community vs. individual focus

**Respect family's cultural norms while providing support:**
- Ask: "What does your family usually do when children are upset?"
- Incorporate cultural practices (prayer, music, food traditions)
- Don't impose Western psychological frameworks if family doesn't use them
- Engage cultural/religious leaders if family requests

---

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| "You're fine, stop crying." | "You're scared. I'm here. You're safe now." |
| Lying about situation ("Everything will be exactly like before") | Honest reassurance ("It's different now, but we will be okay") |
| Forcing discussion ("Tell me how you feel") | Inviting discussion ("I'm here if you want to talk") |
| Exposing to media coverage | Shielding from screens showing disaster footage |
| Expecting them to "get over it" quickly | Recognizing trauma processing takes months |
| Punishing regressive behavior (bedwetting, tantrums) | Understanding as trauma symptom, responding with compassion |
| Sharing adult worries with children | Protecting them from financial/logistical stress beyond their control |
| Separating siblings unnecessarily | Keeping siblings together (peer support) |
| Comparing reactions ("Why can't you be brave like...") | Accepting individual differences in coping |

---

## Child Protection in Disaster Settings

**Increased vulnerability:**
- Separated/unaccompanied children at risk for trafficking, abuse
- Breakdown of normal supervision structures
- Chaotic shelter environments
- Stressed adults may lash out

**Protective measures:**

1. **Keep families together** whenever possible
2. **ID children clearly** (wristband with name and guardian info)
3. **Buddy system** (older children responsible for younger)
4. **Designated safe areas** in shelters (children-only spaces)
5. **Supervised activities** (don't leave children alone with unfamiliar adults)
6. **Teach body safety** (age-appropriate): "No one touches private areas. Tell me if someone makes you uncomfortable."
7. **Monitor for abuse signs:** Unexplained injuries, sexualized behavior, extreme fear of certain people

**If abuse suspected:** Report to authorities if available, separate child from suspected abuser, document injuries.

---

## Communication Scripts by Scenario

### Death of Family Member

**Ages 2-5:**
> "[Name] died. Their body stopped working. They can't come back. This is not your fault. I am very sad. It's okay to be sad. I will keep taking care of you."

**Ages 6-12:**
> "[Name] died in the [disaster]. Dead means their body stopped working and they can't eat, breathe, or talk anymore. They didn't feel pain. Death is permanent - they won't come back. I know you loved them. I loved them too. We will miss them together."

**Ages 13-18:**
> "[Name] died. I know you had a complicated relationship / you were close / [acknowledge their specific situation]. This is devastating. There's no right way to feel. I'm here for whatever you need."

**For all ages:**
- Use the word "died" (not "passed away," "sleeping," "gone on a journey" - confusing)
- Expect repeated questions ("Where is [name]?" - answer each time patiently)
- Allow all feelings (anger is common, especially in children)
- Maintain routine even more strictly

### Loss of Home

**Ages 2-5:**
> "Our house broke in the [disaster]. We can't live there now. We will stay [here] instead. Your [familiar object] is safe. I am safe. You are safe."

**Ages 6-12:**
> "The [disaster] destroyed our house. We lost many of our things. That's really sad - I know you're upset about [specific items]. We're alive and together. That's what matters most. We will build a new home."

**Ages 13-18:**
> "We've lost our home and most of our possessions. I know this impacts your [specific concerns: school, friends, activities]. Your feelings about that are valid. We'll figure out next steps together."

### Ongoing Danger

**Ages 2-5:**
> "[Danger] is happening. I am keeping you safe. We are staying here [safe place]. [Danger] cannot get us here."

**Ages 6-12:**
> "There is still danger from [situation]. Here's what we're doing to stay safe: [specific actions]. I'm monitoring the situation. I will tell you if we need to do anything different."

**Ages 13-18:**
> "Situation is still unstable. Here's what I know [share relevant facts]. Here's what we're doing [safety plan]. I need you to [specific instructions]. Do you have questions?"
