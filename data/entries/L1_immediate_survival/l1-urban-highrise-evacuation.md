# High-Rise Evacuation - Multi-Story Escape

## Overview

**High-rise buildings (7+ stories) require specialized evacuation knowledge because elevators fail, stairwells become chokepoints, and descent time increases dramatically with height.** A 30-story building = 600+ stairs, 20-40 minutes descent time for able-bodied person, 60+ minutes for elderly/disabled.

**Key survival principle:** Evacuate EARLY. Once stairwells are crowded (300+ people), descent slows to 10-15 minutes per floor. A decision delayed by 10 minutes can cost 1-2 hours in stairwell crush conditions.

**When to evacuate immediately:**
- Fire alarm (treat every alarm as real)
- Smoke visible or smelled
- Earthquake (magnitude 5.0+ felt)
- Explosion or structural damage
- Civil unrest reaching building
- Official evacuation order

**When to shelter in place:**
- Active shooter OUTSIDE your floor (lock door, barricade, silence phone)
- Hazmat release OUTSIDE building (seal door gaps, turn off HVAC)
- Severe weather (tornado, hurricane - interior rooms)

---

## Pre-Evacuation: 60-Second Assessment

### Step 1: Identify Threat (15 seconds)

**Touch your door (don't open yet):**
- Hot = fire on your floor or directly above → EVACUATE DOWN immediately
- Warm = fire nearby (within 2-3 floors) → check smoke level
- Cool = fire distant or no fire → safe to proceed with assessment

**Look/listen through peephole or door crack:**
- Smoke in hallway (thick, dark) → DO NOT ENTER, shelter in place or alternate exit
- Smoke (light, high on ceiling) → Evacuate low-crawl style, wet cloth over mouth
- Clear hallway → Proceed to stairwell

### Step 2: Grab Go-Bag (15 seconds max)

**Only if pre-staged near door:**
- Water bottle (16 oz minimum)
- Flashlight (LED, backup batteries)
- Wet cloth / N95 mask (smoke protection)
- ID, cash, phone
- Whistle (signal for help if trapped)
- Emergency contact list (written, not just in phone)

**If not pre-staged: LEAVE IT.** 60 seconds in hallway could mean life/death difference.

### Step 3: Choose Exit Route (10 seconds)

**Primary:** Nearest fire stairs (marked EXIT, lit signs)
**Secondary:** Opposite stairwell (if building has 2+)
**NEVER:** Elevators (power failure traps you, fire recalls elevator to lobby)

### Step 4: Alert Others (10 seconds)

**Knock on 2-3 adjacent doors:**
- "Fire alarm, we're evacuating!"
- Don't wait for response (they may not answer)
- Move on after 5 seconds

### Step 5: Final Check (10 seconds)

- [ ] Shoes on (broken glass, hot surfaces)
- [ ] Keys in pocket (may need re-entry if false alarm)
- [ ] Door closed but unlocked (firefighters may need access)
- [ ] GO NOW

---

## Stairwell Navigation

### Standard Descent Protocol

**Body position:**
- Right hand on railing (standard traffic flow = descend on right, leave left open for emergency personnel ascending)
- Face forward, eyes on steps 2-3 ahead
- Knees slightly bent (shock absorption, prevents falls)
- Small, controlled steps (don't rush - falls cause pile-ups)

**Pace:**
- Floors 20-30: 12-15 seconds per floor (1 flight of stairs)
- Floors 10-19: 10-12 seconds per floor (fresher, faster)
- Floors 1-9: 8-10 seconds per floor (nearly out, adrenaline surge)

**Average descent time:**
- 10 floors: 2-3 minutes
- 20 floors: 5-7 minutes
- 30 floors: 8-12 minutes
- 40+ floors: 12-18 minutes

**Crowd modifier:** Add 50-100% time if 100+ people in stairwell.

### Stairwell Hazards

#### Smoke Accumulation

**Smoke rises, but can fill stairwells from below (fire on lower floor).**

**If you encounter smoke:**
1. Drop to hands and knees (air is clearer 12-18" from ground)
2. Wet cloth over nose/mouth (filter particulates)
3. Breathe shallow (reduces smoke inhalation)
4. Descend 1-2 floors in smoke, reassess

**If smoke worsens (dark, hot, choking):**
- STOP descent
- Return UP to last clear floor
- Find refuge area or alternate exit

**Critical heights:**
- Smoke below 36" = dangerous (evacuees crawling, increased panic)
- Smoke below 12" = critical (near-zero visibility, disorientation)
- Temperature >140°F = flashover imminent, must retreat

#### Crowd Crush

**300+ people in 4-foot-wide stairwell = 0.5-1 ft per person = crush potential.**

**Warning signs:**
- Cannot lift arms to sides (bodies pressed together)
- Feet lifted off ground by crowd pressure
- Difficulty breathing (chest compression)
- Screaming, panic spreading

**Survival techniques:**
1. **Protect chest:** Cross arms in front of chest, elbows out (creates space for lungs)
2. **Move diagonally:** Angle toward stairwell wall (stronger structure, less crowd pressure)
3. **Avoid bottlenecks:** Landings where crowds stop = highest crush risk
4. **If falling:** Curl into ball, protect head, try to get to wall or corner

**If crowd stops moving:**
- Yell "KEEP MOVING!" (crowds freeze when unclear why stopping)
- Don't push (causes panic, pile-ups)
- Wait 30-60 seconds (usually temporary blockage)

#### Door Blockages

**Stairwell doors may be:**
- Locked from stairwell side (illegal in modern buildings, but happens)
- Jammed (debris, earthquake damage)
- Blocked by evacuees who exited and re-entered

**If door won't open:**
- Try next floor down (don't waste time forcing)
- Use emergency door release (look for green EXIT signs with "push bar" or "panic bar")
- Yell for help (someone on other side may push/pull)

**If ALL doors locked (very rare):**
- Descend to ground level (door MUST open to exterior by law)
- Break door glass if visible (window in door, use flashlight or shoe)
- Use emergency phone in stairwell (red box, direct line to fire department)

#### Falls & Injuries

**One person falling = 10+ people pile up in stairwell.**

**If someone falls in front of you:**
- Yell "STOP!" to people behind
- Help person up IMMEDIATELY (don't step over them)
- If injured, move to landing (clear stairs)
- Designate someone to stay with injured, continue evacuation

**If you fall:**
- Roll to side against wall (clear center of stairs)
- Get up FAST (before crowd trample)
- If injured and cannot walk, crawl to landing, yell for help

---

## Alternate Exit Routes

### Roof Access (Last Resort)

**When to consider:**
- Fire below you (smoke filling stairwells)
- Structural damage (stairs collapsed)
- Active threat in stairwell (shooter, chemical attack)

**Roof access:**
1. Find roof access door (top of stairwell, may be locked)
2. Break lock if necessary (fire extinguisher, crowbar)
3. Exit to roof, close door behind (smoke containment)

**On the roof:**
- **DO NOT JUMP** (even 2-3 stories can be fatal)
- Signal for help (wave bright cloth, use flashlight, spell SOS with debris)
- Move to windward side (away from smoke)
- Stay away from edges (wind, panic, slipping)
- Wait for helicopter rescue (FDNY/emergency services for high-rises 40+ floors)

**Helicopter rescue protocol:**
- Lie flat when helicopter approaches (rotor wash = 60+ mph winds)
- Approach from side when signaled (never from rear, tail rotor danger)
- One person at a time (unless harness basket)

### Window Descent (Desperation Only)

**Only if:**
- Fire in your room
- No stairwell access
- Ground rescue not possible (too high for ladders, 7+ stories)

**Rope descent (if you have rope or makeshift rope):**
1. Tie rope to solid anchor (radiator, pipe, desk bolted to floor)
2. Test weight (hang from rope, jump with full weight)
3. Throw rope out window (ensure it reaches ground or lower floor)
4. Rappel down (wrap rope around body, friction brake method)

**Makeshift rope:**
- Bedsheets tied together: 6-8 ft per sheet, holds 200 lbs (test first)
- Curtains, clothing, electrical cords: weaker, use only for 1-2 floors
- Tie square knots, test each knot

**Survival rate:**
- 1 floor drop (10-12 ft): 95%+ (injuries likely, survivable)
- 2 floor drop (20-24 ft): 50-70% (severe injuries, possible death)
- 3+ floors (30+ ft): <20% (likely fatal)

**Only jump if:**
- Fire in your room (you're burning)
- Structural collapse imminent (building leaning, cracking)
- Aim for: grass, bushes, awnings (softer than concrete)

---

## Floor-by-Floor Descent Strategy

### High Floors (30+)

**Time to ground:** 12-18 minutes (no crowds), 30-60 minutes (crowded)

**Strategy:**
- Start IMMEDIATELY (don't wait for others)
- Pace yourself (20+ minutes of stairs = cardio workout)
- Rest on landings ONLY (don't stop mid-flight)
- Drink water every 10 floors (dehydration + exertion = fainting)

**Challenges:**
- Fatigue (thighs burn, knees ache)
- Crowds (upper floors evacuate last, but join early)
- Smoke (rises from below if fire on lower floors)

### Mid Floors (10-29)

**Time to ground:** 5-12 minutes (no crowds), 15-30 minutes (crowded)

**Strategy:**
- Maintain steady pace (don't sprint, don't dawdle)
- Watch for crowds from above (merge carefully)
- Help elderly/children if safe (don't sacrifice yourself)

**Challenges:**
- Merging crowds (upper floors joining your stairwell)
- Smoke possibility (mid-floors = fire spread zone)

### Low Floors (2-9)

**Time to ground:** 2-5 minutes (no crowds), 5-15 minutes (crowded)

**Strategy:**
- Nearly out, but don't sprint (falls at finish line)
- Watch for ground floor congestion (exit doors = bottleneck)
- Prepare for exterior hazards (smoke, debris, crowds)

**Challenges:**
- Ground floor backup (everyone exiting at once)
- First responders entering (stay right, give them left lane)

---

## Ground Floor Exit Protocol

### Lobby Assessment (5 seconds)

**Check before exiting:**
- Smoke or fire visible through lobby doors?
- Crowds pushing/shoving at exits?
- Broken glass or debris?

**Safe:** Proceed to nearest exit  
**Unsafe:** Find alternate exit (loading dock, underground parking, connected building)

### Exit Door Jam

**If 100+ people at one exit:**
- Don't push (causes crush)
- Look for alternate exits (side doors, service entrances)
- Yell "USE OTHER DOORS!" (redirect crowd)

**If doors locked/jammed:**
- Break glass with fire extinguisher or heavy object
- Stand to side when breaking (glass shards)
- Clear glass from frame before climbing through

### Exterior Hazards

**Once outside:**
- Move 200+ feet from building (falling glass, debris, secondary collapse)
- Count your group (ensure no one left behind)
- Call 911 if not already called
- Do NOT re-enter (never, for any reason)

**Watch for:**
- Falling glass (windows popping from heat)
- Debris (building facade, signage)
- Emergency vehicles (stay clear, don't block access)

---

## Special Populations

### Mobility Impaired (Wheelchair, Walker, Crutches)

**DO NOT use elevators (will fail/recall during fire).**

**Options:**
1. **Areas of refuge:** Fire-rated rooms on each floor (designated wheelchair waiting areas)
   - Remain there, call 911, wait for firefighter rescue
   - Pressurized, fire-resistant (30-60 min protection)
   
2. **Evacuation chair:** Stairwell descent device (looks like a tracked sled)
   - Requires 1-2 people to operate
   - Descends stairs smoothly (wheels/tracks)
   - Speed: 1-2 floors per minute
   
3. **Buddy carry:** Two people carry wheelchair user
   - Seat carry or fireman carry
   - SLOW (1 floor every 2-3 minutes)
   - High exertion (helper fatigue)

**Pre-planning:**
- Identify helpers (coworkers, neighbors)
- Know location of areas of refuge (each floor)
- Practice evacuation (quarterly drills)

### Children

**Carry if <5 years old:** Faster than walking, reduces panic  
**Hold hand if 5-12 years:** Prevents separation in crowds  
**Instruct if 13+:** Treat as adult, explain calmly

**Key messages:**
- "Stay with me, hold my hand."
- "We're going down the stairs to get outside."
- "It's going to be loud, but we're safe."

**If separated:**
- Child should find adult in uniform (firefighter, police)
- Rally point outside (pre-designated tree, mailbox, etc.)

### Elderly

**Common issues:**
- Slow descent (10-15 sec per flight, vs 8-10 sec for adults)
- Fatigue (must rest every 5-10 floors)
- Disorientation (dementia, confusion)

**Assistance:**
- Offer arm for stability (don't pull, just steady)
- Rest on landings (30-60 seconds)
- Keep talking (reassurance, prevent panic)

### Pregnant Women

**Up to 7 months:** Usually able to descend normally (take breaks)  
**8-9 months:** Slower, rest frequently, watch for contractions (stress-induced labor possible)

**Signs of labor:**
- Regular contractions (<5 min apart)
- Water breaking (fluid from vagina)
- Severe pain

**If labor starts:**
- Get to landing, call 911
- Do NOT attempt descent if delivery imminent
- Keep mother calm, warm, hydrated

---

## Scenario-Specific Protocols

### Fire Above You

**Smoke descends LESS than it rises (heat differential).**

**Action:**
- Evacuate normally (descend away from fire)
- Smoke minimal (fire rises, doesn't descend quickly)
- Watch for heat (handrails hot = fire close)

### Fire Below You

**Smoke rises RAPIDLY (stack effect in tall buildings).**

**Action:**
1. Descend until you hit smoke
2. If smoke light, push through (low-crawl, wet cloth)
3. If smoke heavy, STOP and retreat up
4. Go to roof or area of refuge
5. Call 911 (tell them you're trapped above fire)

**Do NOT:**
- Continue into heavy smoke (smoke inhalation kills in 2-3 minutes)
- Wait in your room (fire spreads, smoke infiltrates)

### Fire on Your Floor

**Immediate threat to life.**

**Action:**
1. Touch door (hot = fire in hallway)
2. If hot, DO NOT OPEN (backdraft possible)
3. Seal door gaps (wet towels, duct tape)
4. Go to window, signal for help
5. Break window if needed (air supply, signal visibility)
6. Wait for firefighter rescue (ladder truck, window entry)

**Seal room from smoke:**
- Wet towels under door
- Duct tape around door frame
- Turn off HVAC (prevents smoke circulation)
- Stay low (air cleaner near floor)

### Earthquake During Evacuation

**Stairwells may shift, crack, or collapse.**

**Action:**
1. Drop, cover, hold (protect head, duck into corner)
2. Wait for shaking to stop (10-60 seconds typically)
3. Check for structural damage (cracks, leaning, loose concrete)
4. If safe, continue descent
5. If damaged, find area of refuge or alternate route

**Watch for:**
- Aftershocks (can collapse already-weakened structures)
- Fallen ceiling tiles, light fixtures
- Exposed rebar, concrete chunks

---

## Communication & Coordination

### Cellphone Usage

**Call 911 ONCE:**
- State: Building address, floor number, nature of emergency
- Listen for instructions
- Hang up (don't tie up line)

**Text if possible (less bandwidth than calls):**
- "Safe, evacuating from [building], floor [X]"
- Family group chat or emergency contact

**Battery conservation:**
- Airplane mode (except for emergency call)
- Brightness low
- Power save mode

### Verbal Commands in Crowds

**Effective phrases:**
- "KEEP MOVING!" (when crowd stalls)
- "STAY RIGHT!" (maintain traffic flow)
- "HELP NEEDED!" (someone injured, need assistance)
- "EXIT CLEAR!" (reassure people behind you)

**Don't yell:**
- "FIRE!" (everyone already knows, causes panic)
- Profanity (wastes breath, doesn't help)

### Emergency Contact

**If trapped in stairwell:**
1. Call 911, report location (floor, stairwell letter/number)
2. Bang on door or wall (rhythmic, 3 bangs, pause, repeat)
3. Use whistle (carries farther than voice)
4. Activate phone flashlight (visible to rescuers)

**Wait time:**
- Urban area: 5-10 minutes for firefighters to arrive
- High-rise: +10-20 minutes to reach upper floors (set up, ascend)

---

## Post-Evacuation

### Assembly Point

**Designated location (pre-determined by building):**
- 200+ feet from building (safe from falling debris)
- Clear of roadways (emergency vehicle access)
- Visible to building manager (headcount)

**If no designated point:**
- Across street, upwind of smoke
- Public space (park, parking lot, plaza)

**Headcount:**
- Check in with supervisor/manager
- Report missing persons to fire personnel
- Do NOT re-enter to search (firefighters' job)

### Medical Check

**Self-assessment:**
- Smoke inhalation (coughing, chest pain, dizziness)
- Injuries (cuts, sprains, burns)
- Heat exhaustion (excessive sweating, nausea, confusion)

**Seek medical if:**
- Difficulty breathing (respiratory distress)
- Chest pain (possible heart attack from stress)
- Severe bleeding, broken bones
- Confusion, disorientation (shock, smoke inhalation)

**Paramedics will triage:**
- Red tag: Life-threatening (immediate treatment)
- Yellow tag: Serious (can wait 30-60 min)
- Green tag: Minor (walking wounded)
- Black tag: Deceased (no further action)

### Re-Entry Decision

**DO NOT re-enter until:**
- Fire department gives all-clear
- Structural engineers assess building (if earthquake/explosion)
- Gas/electrical confirmed off (if relevant)

**Even if "all-clear":**
- Water may be contaminated (smoke, fire suppressant)
- Power may be out (elevators, HVAC, security)
- Structural weakening (hidden damage)

**Plan to evacuate from the area if:**
- Building condemned (severe damage)
- No power/water for >24 hours
- Secondary threats (gas leak, chemical spill)

---

## High-Rise Evacuation Drills

### Monthly Practice (5-10 minutes)

**Walk your escape route:**
1. Start at your door
2. Walk to stairwell (time it)
3. Descend 2-3 floors (feel for handrails, count steps)
4. Return via elevator

**Purpose:**
- Familiarity (muscle memory under stress)
- Identify obstacles (locked doors, poor lighting)
- Confirm exits functional (not blocked, doors open)

### Quarterly Full Drill (20-40 minutes)

**Full descent to ground:**
1. Simulate real evacuation (grab go-bag, close door)
2. Descend entire building (time yourself)
3. Reach assembly point
4. Note challenges (fatigue, crowding, door jams)

**Improvement:**
- Adjust go-bag (too heavy, missing items)
- Increase fitness (stair climbing endurance)
- Coordinate with neighbors (buddy system)

## Quick Reference: Floor-to-Ground Times

| Starting Floor | Solo (No Crowds) | Light Crowds (50-100 people) | Heavy Crowds (300+ people) |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 10th floor | 2-3 min | 5-8 min | 10-15 min |
| 20th floor | 5-7 min | 10-15 min | 20-30 min |
| 30th floor | 8-12 min | 15-25 min | 30-45 min |
| 40th floor | 12-18 min | 25-40 min | 45-75 min |
| 50th floor | 18-25 min | 35-60 min | 60-120 min |

**Multiply by 1.5x for:**
- Elderly (65+)
- Children (<10 years)
- Mobility issues (crutches, injury)
- High stress (panic, unfamiliarity)

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Waiting for elevator | Use stairs ALWAYS during fire/earthquake |
| Grabbing belongings (laptop, etc.) | 60 seconds max - go-bag only |
| Going up to roof immediately | Only if fire below + smoke in stairs |
| Opening hot door | Touch first - if hot, seal room & call 911 |
| Sprinting down stairs | Controlled pace - falls cause pile-ups |
| Re-entering building | NEVER - even for pets, documents, valuables |
| Ignoring alarm (assuming false alarm) | Treat every alarm as real |
| Forgetting to alert neighbors | Knock on 2-3 doors, shout "Evacuate!" |
| Carrying heavy items | Hands free for railings, helping others |
| Using phone for social media | Battery for 911 and emergency contact only |

---

## When to Shelter in Place (Do NOT Evacuate)

**Active shooter:**
- If shooter in stairwell or lobby → Lock door, barricade, hide
- If shooter on your floor → Evacuate if clear path, else barricade

**Hazmat release:**
- Chemical cloud outside building → Seal windows, turn off HVAC
- Better to shelter than walk through toxic cloud

**Tornado/Hurricane:**
- High winds = flying debris, broken glass
- Interior room, low floor (basement if available)

**Civil unrest (mob at building entrance):**
- Wait for police escort or crowd dispersal
- Fortify apartment (see [Apartment Fortification](#))
