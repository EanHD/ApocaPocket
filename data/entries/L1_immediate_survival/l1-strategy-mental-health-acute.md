summary: 'Someone is having a panic attack, suicidal crisis, or psychotic break RIGHT NOW. You need immediate interventions. This entry covers: de-escalation, safety protocols, and stabilization techniques
  for acute mental health emergencies when no professional help is available.'
warnings:
- Someone in psychosis may become violent — ensure your own safety first
- Do NOT physically restrain unless absolutely necessary (risk of injury to both parties)
- Substances (alcohol withdrawal, drug use) can cause psychiatric symptoms — consider medical causes
- After acute crisis, ongoing monitoring is essential — most suicides occur in the days after the crisis appears to resolve
steps:
- 'PANIC ATTACK: SYMPTOMS: sudden intense fear, rapid heartbeat, chest pain, trouble breathing, sweating, shaking, feeling of dying or losing control. INTERVENTION: (1) Move to quiet, safe location. (2)
  Reassure (''You''re having a panic attack. It feels terrible but it''s not dangerous. It will pass in 10-20 minutes''). (3) Breathing: slow, deep breaths. Count: breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for
  4. (4) Grounding: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. (5) DO NOT tell them to ''calm down'' (counterproductive). (6) Stay with them until symptoms
  subside.'
- 'ACTIVE SUICIDAL CRISIS: SIGNS: person says they want to die, has a plan, has means, is saying goodbye, or is acting recklessly. INTERVENTION: (1) Take it seriously — never dismiss. (2) Do not leave them
  alone. (3) Remove weapons, rope, medications, anything that could be used for self-harm. (4) Ask directly: ''Are you planning to kill yourself? When? How?'' Getting details shows you care and lets you
  intervene. (5) Listen without judgment. Don''t argue or offer platitudes (''You have so much to live for''). Just listen. (6) Create a safety contract: ''Promise me you won''t hurt yourself for the next
  24 hours. If you feel this way again, you''ll tell me first.'' (7) Involve trusted others. Increase supervision. (8) Focus on immediate short-term safety, not long-term solutions.'
- 'ACUTE PSYCHOSIS: SYMPTOMS: hallucinations (seeing/hearing things), delusions (false beliefs), disorganized speech, paranoia, agitation. CAUSES: sleep deprivation, extreme stress, drug use/withdrawal,
  head injury, infection. INTERVENTION: (1) Stay calm and non-threatening. (2) Speak slowly, simply, clearly. (3) Do not argue with delusions (''No, there are no voices'' is unhelpful). Instead: ''I don''t
  hear them, but I believe you do.'' (4) Ensure safety (remove weapons, sharp objects). (5) Reduce stimulation (quiet, low-light environment). (6) Keep them fed, hydrated, and rested. (7) If paranoid: keep
  distance, don''t approach suddenly, explain what you''re doing before you do it. (8) If aggressive: evacuate others, keep yourself between exit and patient, talk calmly. (9) Physical restraint = absolute
  last resort (risk of injury and traumatization).'
- 'SEVERE DEPRESSION (SHUTDOWN): SYMPTOMS: won''t speak, won''t move, not eating/drinking, staring into space, completely withdrawn. INTERVENTION: (1) Basic care: help them eat, drink, move to shelter,
  stay warm. (2) Speak gently but don''t expect response. (3) Physical touch (if appropriate): hand on shoulder, gentle hug. (4) Sit with them silently — presence matters. (5) Set tiny goals: ''Can you
  drink this water? Good. Can you take three steps with me? Good.'' Build up slowly. (6) Do NOT give up on them. Recovery can take days to weeks.'
- 'VIOLENT OUTBURST: CAUSES: fear, frustration, psychosis, intoxication, head injury. INTERVENTION: (1) Your safety first — maintain distance. (2) Stay calm (your calmness is contagious). (3) Speak slowly
  and clearly: ''I want to help you. I''m not going to hurt you. Can you tell me what''s wrong?'' (4) Give space and options: ''You can stay here or go outside. It''s up to you.'' (5) Do not corner them.
  (6) If they''re armed: back away, talk calmly, wait for them to calm down. (7) If violence is imminent and unavoidable: evacuate vulnerable people (children, elderly), use numbers (group de-escalation),
  restrain ONLY if absolutely necessary and only with multiple people.'
- 'POST-CRISIS STABILIZATION: (1) Physical needs: water, food, sleep, warmth. (2) Supervision: someone stays with them for 24-72 hours. (3) Routine: return to normal activities as soon as possible. (4)
  Debrief (when ready): ''Do you want to talk about what happened?'' Let them lead. (5) Reduce stressors: lighter workload, fewer responsibilities temporarily. (6) Watch for relapse: most acute crises recur
  in the first week. (7) Long-term plan: address underlying causes (sleep deprivation, grief, isolation, lack of purpose).'
- 'RECOGNIZING WHEN YOU''RE OVERWHELMED: Caring for someone in crisis is exhausting. If YOU feel: hopeless, angry, numb, or like giving up — you need support. Rotate caregiving with others. Take breaks.
  Eat and sleep. You cannot pour from an empty cup.'
