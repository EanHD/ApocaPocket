summary: 'Someone is having a panic attack, suicidal crisis, or psychotic break RIGHT NOW. You need immediate interventions. This entry covers: de-escalation, safety protocols, and stabilization techniques
  for acute mental health emergencies when no professional help is available. Mental health crises kill as surely as physical trauma.'
warnings:
- Someone in psychosis or violent crisis may harm you — ensure your own safety FIRST (you can't help if you're injured/dead)
- Do NOT physically restrain unless life is in immediate danger (causes trauma, escalates violence, risk of injury/death)
- Substances (alcohol withdrawal, drug use, head injury) can mimic psychiatric symptoms — consider medical causes
- After acute crisis, suicide risk INCREASES in first 72 hours (apparent calm = danger period)
- Children in crisis require modified approach (age-appropriate language, involve parents if safe)
- Your own mental health matters — rotate caregivers, take breaks, process your emotions

# Mental Health Crisis — Acute Intervention in the Field

Someone is having a panic attack, suicidal crisis, or psychotic break RIGHT NOW. Mental health emergencies are as dangerous as physical injuries — they just kill differently (suicide, reckless behavior, inability to care for self). When there's no 911, no hospital, no medication, YOU are the intervention.

## RECOGNITION & TRIAGE (First 60 Seconds)

### IMMEDIATE DANGER ASSESSMENT:
- [ ] **To self?** Suicidal statements, self-harm, refusing food/water, reckless behavior
- [ ] **To others?** Threats, weapons, violence, erratic aggression
- [ ] **Medical cause?** Head injury, fever, substance intoxication/withdrawal, dehydration

**IF IMMEDIATE DANGER:** See Emergency Protocols below.  
**IF NO IMMEDIATE DANGER:** Assess symptom type for appropriate intervention.

### PRIMARY SYMPTOM IDENTIFICATION:

**PANIC/ANXIETY:**
- Physical: Racing heart, hyperventilation, chest pain, sweating, shaking
- Mental: "I'm dying", "I'm going crazy", terror, feeling of impending doom
- Duration: Peaks in 10-20 minutes, subsides gradually
- Lucidity: Person is aware this is happening, can communicate

**PSYCHOSIS:**
- Hallucinations: Seeing, hearing, feeling things that aren't there
- Delusions: False beliefs (paranoia, grandiosity, persecution)
- Disorganized: Incoherent speech, bizarre behavior, can't follow conversation
- Lucidity: Person may not realize they're unwell, doesn't share your reality

**DEPRESSION SHUTDOWN:**
- Physical: Won't move, won't eat/drink, staring blankly
- Mental: Profound hopelessness, inability to function, "everything is pointless"
- Duration: Days to weeks without intervention
- Lucidity: Aware but unable to care

**VIOLENT OUTBURST:**
- Physical: Attacking, breaking things, threatening with weapons
- Mental: Rage, fear, paranoia, loss of control
- Duration: Minutes to hours
- Lucidity: Variable (may be rational between outbursts or completely dissociated)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (FIRST 5-15 MINUTES)

### FOR PANIC ATTACK:

**Environment:**
- [ ] Move to quiet, calm space (away from crowds, noise, chaos)
- [ ] Dim lights if possible
- [ ] Sit or lie down (reduces physical strain)

**Communication:**
- **SAY:** "You're having a panic attack. It feels like you're dying, but you're not. This will pass in 10-20 minutes. I'm staying with you."
- **DON'T SAY:** "Calm down," "Just relax," "You're fine" (invalidating and counterproductive)

**Breathing Intervention (Box Breathing):**
1. "Breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 counts." (Count out loud: 1, 2, 3, 4)
2. "Hold for 4 counts."
3. "Breathe out slowly through your mouth for 4 counts."
4. "Hold for 4 counts."
5. Repeat for 5-10 cycles or until breathing normalizes

**Grounding Technique (5-4-3-2-1):**
- "Name 5 things you can see." (Wait for them to name them)
- "Name 4 things you can touch." (Have them touch: chair, ground, their shirt, etc.)
- "Name 3 things you can hear."
- "Name 2 things you can smell."
- "Name 1 thing you can taste."
- **Purpose:** Brings awareness back to present reality, interrupts panic spiral

**Physical Grounding:**
- Cold water on face or hands (activates dive reflex, slows heart rate)
- Ice cube to hold (intense sensation interrupts panic)
- Pressure: Hand on chest, weighted blanket, firm hug (if they consent)

**Stay & Monitor:**
- DO NOT leave them alone until symptoms subside (10-30 minutes)
- Talk calmly about non-threatening topics once breathing stabilizes
- Normalize: "Panic attacks are common in high-stress situations. You're okay."

### FOR ACTIVE SUICIDAL CRISIS:

**Recognition:**
- **Statements:** "I want to die," "I can't do this anymore," "Everyone would be better off without me," "I have a plan"
- **Behavior:** Giving away possessions, saying goodbye, writing notes, sudden calmness after deep depression (decision made), seeking access to weapons/pills/rope
- **Risk factors:** Recent major loss (death, rejection), isolation, previous attempts, substance abuse, hopelessness

**IMMEDIATE SAFETY:**
- [ ] **DO NOT LEAVE THEM ALONE** (even to go to bathroom — someone stays within sight/earshot)
- [ ] **REMOVE MEANS:**
  - Weapons (guns, knives)
  - Rope, belts, cords (hanging)
  - Medications (overdose)
  - Razors, glass, sharp objects (cutting)
  - High places (jumping) — stay ground level
- [ ] **Gather others:** Alert trusted community members, family (more eyes = safer)

**Communication (Direct & Non-Judgmental):**
- **ASK DIRECTLY:** "Are you thinking about killing yourself?"
  - Myth: "Asking about suicide plants the idea." FALSE. Asking shows you care and gives them permission to talk.
- **IF YES:** "Do you have a plan? What is it? When?"
  - Specific plan + means + timeline = HIGHEST RISK
- **LISTEN WITHOUT:**
  - Arguing ("You have so much to live for" = dismissive)
  - Minimizing ("It's not that bad")
  - Problem-solving ("Just do X and you'll feel better")
- **VALIDATE:** "I hear you. You're in a lot of pain. I'm glad you told me."

**Safety Contract (Short-Term):**
- "I need you to promise me you won't hurt yourself for the next 24 hours. If you feel this way again before tomorrow, you'll come find me first. Can you promise me that?"
- Get verbal agreement
- **Repeat daily** until acute risk passes (72 hours to 1 week typically)

**Supervision Protocol:**
- **24/7 watch** for first 72 hours (rotate caregivers every 2-4 hours)
- Never alone — bathroom, sleeping, eating (someone within arm's reach)
- Remove privacy temporarily (harsh but necessary — privacy = opportunity)
- Sleep in same room or immediate vicinity

**Give Purpose (Short-Term Focus):**
- "I need you to help me with [task] tomorrow. Can you do that?"
- Small, specific, immediate (not "we need you" generically, but "tomorrow morning, help me fetch water")
- Creates obligation to survive until tomorrow

**Monitor for:**
- Sudden improvement in mood (may indicate decision made to attempt — DANGER)
- Withdrawal, silence (planning)
- Continued statements about death

### FOR ACUTE PSYCHOSIS:

**Recognition:**
- **Hallucinations:**
  - Auditory: Hearing voices (commanding, commenting, conversing)
  - Visual: Seeing people/things that aren't there
  - Tactile: Feeling bugs crawling, being touched
- **Delusions:**
  - Paranoid: "They're trying to kill me," "The food is poisoned," "You're not who you say you are"
  - Grandiose: "I'm God," "I have special powers," "I'm on a mission"
  - Reference: "The radio is sending me messages," "Everyone is talking about me"
- **Disorganization:** Incoherent speech (word salad), bizarre actions, can't track conversation

**Causes (Consider Medical):**
- Extreme sleep deprivation (3+ days awake)
- Severe dehydration/fever
- Head injury
- Drug use (stimulants, hallucinogens) or alcohol withdrawal
- **Action:** Treat underlying cause if identified (rest, hydrate, cool fever)

**SAFETY FIRST (Yours & Theirs):**
- [ ] Remove weapons/dangerous objects from area
- [ ] Maintain personal space (don't crowd or touch without warning)
- [ ] Position yourself between exit and patient (you can leave if threatened)
- [ ] Have others present but not crowding (numbers = safety, but too many = overwhelming)

**Communication (Calm, Clear, Non-Confrontational):**
- **Speak:** Slowly, simply, low-pitched voice (high pitch = alarming)
- **Say their name** often (grounds them in reality)
- **DO NOT argue with delusions:**
  - DON'T: "No, there are no voices. You're imagining it."
  - DO: "I don't hear the voices, but I believe you do. That must be scary."
- **Validate feelings, not delusions:** "You seem frightened. I'm not here to hurt you."
- **Offer choices (sense of control):** "Would you like to sit inside or outside?" "Water or juice?"

**Environment (Reduce Stimulation):**
- Quiet (no loud music, TV, crowds)
- Dim lighting (bright lights can worsen agitation)
- Simple (remove clutter, too many people)
- Safe (no sharp objects, breakables, weapons)

**Basic Needs (Often Neglected During Psychosis):**
- Hydration (offer water frequently — dehydration worsens symptoms)
- Food (simple, familiar — not time for new foods)
- Sleep (psychosis worsens with exhaustion — help them rest)
- Bathroom (remind them if not initiating)

**If Paranoid Specifically:**
- Keep distance (close proximity = threat)
- Announce actions ("I'm going to hand you this water now")
- Don't whisper or talk about them in their presence
- No sudden movements
- Let them see your hands (open, non-threatening)

**If Hallucinations Commanding Harm:**
- "What are the voices saying?" (assess danger)
- "You don't have to listen to them. They're not real."
- Increase supervision (voices commanding self-harm = suicide risk)

**Duration & Monitoring:**
- Acute psychosis can last hours to days
- Monitor for violence risk (increasing agitation, threats)
- Protect them from acting on delusions (wandering off, refusing food thinking it's poisoned, etc.)

### FOR DEPRESSION SHUTDOWN (Complete Withdrawal):

**Recognition:**
- Won't speak or speaks minimally (monosyllables)
- Won't move from bed/spot
- Not eating or drinking
- Staring blankly, no eye contact
- Doesn't respond to questions or stimuli
- May be catatonic (frozen posture)

**IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL CARE:**
- [ ] Hydration: Put water to lips, encourage sips (dehydration worsens mental state and can kill)
- [ ] Food: Simple, easy-to-eat items (broth, bread, fruit) — don't expect them to prepare food
- [ ] Shelter: Move to warm, dry location if exposed (they may not self-protect)
- [ ] Hygiene: Assist with bathroom, wiping face, changing clothes if needed (maintain dignity)

**Communication (Patient & Gentle):**
- **Speak TO them**, not ABOUT them in their presence ("I'm going to bring you water now")
- **Don't expect response**, but talk anyway ("I know you're struggling. I'm here.")
- **No demands or urgency** ("You need to eat NOW" = overwhelming)
- **Narrate care:** "I'm putting a blanket on you. There's water here if you want it."

**Physical Presence:**
- Sit with them silently (presence = connection)
- Appropriate touch (hand on shoulder, holding hand) — if they accept it
- No forced interaction ("Talk to me!" = pressure)

**Micro-Goals (Tiny Steps):**
- "Can you drink this sip of water?" → Celebrate if they do
- "Can you stand up for just a moment?" → Success
- "Can you walk three steps with me?" → Progress
- Build gradually — don't push too hard too fast

**DO NOT:**
- Give up on them ("They're choosing this" — NO, they're ill)
- Force major activities (expecting them to work, socialize)
- Rush recovery ("You should be better by now")

**Duration:**
- Severe shutdown can last days to weeks
- Improvement is gradual (small responses return first, then movement, then speech)
- Require ongoing support for weeks to months

### FOR VIOLENT OUTBURST / AGGRESSION:

**Recognition:**
- Yelling, screaming, threats
- Hitting, kicking, throwing objects
- Armed with weapon (knife, gun, stick, rock)
- Destroying property
- May be triggered by: Fear, frustration, psychosis, intoxication, pain

**YOUR SAFETY FIRST:**
- [ ] **Maintain distance** (beyond weapon/fist range)
- [ ] **Position:** Between exit and aggressor (you can escape)
- [ ] **DO NOT corner them** (trapped person escalates)
- [ ] **Call for help** (others to assist, strength in numbers)
- [ ] **Evaluate risk:** Is this person known to you? History of violence? Weapon present?

**De-Escalation (If Safe to Attempt):**
- **Stay calm** (your calm is contagious, your panic escalates theirs)
- **Non-threatening body language:**
  - Hands visible, open, at sides (not on hips, not pointing)
  - Relaxed posture (not aggressive stance)
  - Neutral face (no anger or fear showing)
  - Avoid direct prolonged eye contact (can be seen as challenge)
- **Speak:** Slowly, low voice, calm tone
- **Say:** "I'm not here to hurt you. I want to understand what's wrong. Can you tell me?"
- **Acknowledge feelings:** "You seem really angry/scared. That's okay. Talk to me."
- **Offer choices:** "You can stay here or go outside. You decide." (Control reduces violence)

**Do NOT:**
- Argue or challenge ("You're wrong!")
- Give orders ("Put that down NOW!")
- Touch them without permission
- Move suddenly
- Crowd them with multiple people (unless violence is imminent and restraint needed)

**If Armed with Weapon:**
- **Back away slowly** (don't run — triggers chase)
- **Talk while backing:** "I don't want anyone to get hurt. Let's talk about this."
- **Don't grab for weapon** (risk of injury to both)
- **Wait:** Many violent crises de-escalate if given time and space

**If Violence is Imminent & Unavoidable:**
- **Evacuate vulnerable** (children, elderly, injured)
- **Group intervention** (3-5 people = safer than 1)
- **Restrain ONLY if necessary:**
  - Life is in immediate danger (they're killing someone, about to jump off cliff)
  - Multiple people (never attempt alone)
  - Technique: Control limbs, protect head, position on side (not face-down = suffocation risk)
  - **Duration:** As brief as possible (prolonged restraint = trauma and injury)
  - **After:** Monitor for injuries, explain what happened, provide care

**Post-Violence:**
- Separate aggressor (cooling off period)
- Check for injuries (them and any victims)
- Debrief (when calm): "What happened? What can we do differently?"
- Establish consequences (if repeated, what will community do?)

## TIMELINE-BASED RECOVERY

### FIRST 24 HOURS POST-CRISIS:

**Supervision:**
- Never alone (suicidal = 24/7, others = check every 30-60 min)
- Sleep in same room or adjacent
- Bathroom: Door unlocked, someone nearby

**Physical Care:**
- Hydrate (crisis = physical stress)
- Feed (simple, familiar foods)
- Rest (sleep if possible — exhaustion worsens mental state)
- Warmth (crisis often includes shivering, cold sweats)

**Emotional:**
- Presence (don't need to talk, just be there)
- Reassure: "The crisis is over. You're safe. I'm staying with you."
- No pressure to "process" yet (too soon)

### DAYS 2-3 POST-CRISIS:

**Supervision:**
- Can reduce to check-ins every 1-2 hours if stable
- Suicidal cases remain under constant supervision

**Return to Routine (Gradually):**
- Light tasks (organize supplies, prepare simple meals)
- Social interaction (talk with trusted people)
- Physical activity (short walk, stretching)
- **Purpose:** Routine combats despair, productivity builds self-worth

**Debrief (When Ready):**
- "Do you want to talk about what happened?"
- Let THEM lead (don't interrogate)
- Listen without judgment
- **Don't:** "Why did you do that?" (shame-inducing)
- **Do:** "What can I do to help if this happens again?"

**Monitor for Relapse:**
- Return of symptoms (withdrawal, agitation, suicidal talk)
- Most relapses occur Days 2-7
- Increase supervision if relapse signs appear

### WEEK 1-2 POST-CRISIS:

**Ongoing Support:**
- Daily check-ins ("How are you feeling today?")
- Involvement in community activities (combat isolation)
- Assigned role (gives purpose)
- Social connection (meals together, conversations, shared work)

**Address Underlying Causes:**
- **Grief:** Allow mourning, create memorials
- **Isolation:** Increase social contact
- **Lack of purpose:** Assign meaningful work
- **Sleep deprivation:** Prioritize rest
- **Physical illness:** Treat infections, pain, malnutrition

**Reduce Stressors:**
- Lighter workload temporarily
- Fewer responsibilities
- More support

**Long-Term Plan:**
- Identify triggers (what caused crisis?)
- Develop coping strategies (when you feel this way, you will…)
- Build support network (who can you talk to?)

## GROUP DYNAMICS & ROLE ASSIGNMENT

### Who SHOULD Provide Care:

**BEST CAREGIVERS:**
- Calm, patient people (crisis management requires emotional steadiness)
- Trusted by person in crisis (existing relationship = trust)
- Trained in mental health or medical fields (if available)
- Emotionally healthy themselves (can't pour from empty cup)

**GOOD CAREGIVERS (Can Learn):**
- Compassionate community members willing to learn
- Those who can follow protocols without panic
- People who won't shame or judge

### Who SHOULD NOT Provide Care:

**AVOID:**
- Family members in conflict with person (unresolved issues escalate crisis)
- People who are judging/blaming ("This is your fault," "Just get over it")
- Those with own untreated mental health issues (crisis is contagious)
- Exhausted caregivers (burnout = mistakes)
- Children (except as support, not primary caregivers)

### Rotation System:

**For 24/7 supervision:**
- 2-4 hour shifts (longer = burnout)
- Minimum 3-4 caregivers (allows rest)
- Scheduled (so everyone knows when they're "on")
- Brief handoff ("Here's what happened in my shift, watch for X")

**Caregiver Self-Care:**
- Mandatory breaks
- Debrief with each other (vent frustrations, share strategies)
- Recognize signs of burnout in yourself:
  - Resentment toward person in crisis
  - Hopelessness ("They'll never get better")
  - Numbness or detachment
  - Anger, irritability
  - **If burned out:** Take break, hand off to someone else, get support

## COMMON FATAL MISTAKES

### 1. DISMISSING SUICIDE THREATS ("Attention-Seeking")
- **Mistake:** "They're just trying to get attention, they won't really do it"
- **Result:** They DO do it. Most suicide attempts follow warnings.
- **Avoid:** ALWAYS take suicide talk seriously. Remove means. Supervise.

### 2. LEAVING SUICIDAL PERSON ALONE ("Just for a Minute")
- **Mistake:** "I'll just go get water, be right back"
- **Result:** That minute is when they act. Hanging takes 5 minutes. Overdose takes 30 seconds.
- **Avoid:** NEVER alone for first 72 hours. If you must leave room, someone else takes over.

### 3. ARGUING WITH PSYCHOSIS ("That's Not Real!")
- **Mistake:** Trying to convince them their hallucinations/delusions are false
- **Result:** Escalation, loss of trust, increased paranoia
- **Avoid:** Validate feelings, don't validate delusions. "I don't see it, but I believe you do."

### 4. RESTRAINING PREMATURELY (Control Impulse)
- **Mistake:** Grabbing/restraining someone who is agitated but not yet violent
- **Result:** Restraint CAUSES violence (fight response), trauma, injury
- **Avoid:** De-escalate with words first. Restraint = absolute last resort.

### 5. SHAMING ("What's Wrong with You?")
- **Mistake:** Blaming person for crisis ("Stop being so dramatic," "Man up")
- **Result:** Worsens depression/suicidality, destroys trust, isolation
- **Avoid:** Compassion. They're ill, not weak. "I see you're struggling. I'm here to help."

### 6. IGNORING MEDICAL CAUSES (Assuming "Just Crazy")
- **Mistake:** Not checking for head injury, fever, dehydration, drug withdrawal
- **Result:** Treatable medical condition worsens, person dies from missed infection/injury
- **Avoid:** Always assess physical health. Treat dehydration, fever, injury first.

### 7. NO POST-CRISIS MONITORING (Assuming "Crisis Over")
- **Mistake:** Returning to normal immediately after person stabilizes
- **Result:** Relapse in 2-7 days (most suicides occur AFTER apparent recovery)
- **Avoid:** Ongoing supervision/check-ins for 1-2 weeks minimum.

### 8. CAREGIVER BURNOUT (No Rotation)
- **Mistake:** One person stays with suicidal individual for 72 hours straight
- **Result:** Caregiver exhaustion = mistakes (falling asleep, missing warning signs), or resentment (leading to neglect)
- **Avoid:** Mandatory rotation (2-4 hour shifts). Caregiver health = patient safety.

### 9. ISOLATING PERSON POST-CRISIS ("They Need Rest")
- **Mistake:** Keeping person alone in room "to recover"
- **Result:** Isolation worsens depression/suicidality. They feel abandoned.
- **Avoid:** Involve in community activities (gently). Isolation = enemy of mental health.

### 10. EXPECTING QUICK RECOVERY ("They Should Be Better By Now")
- **Mistake:** Impatience with slow recovery (weeks to months for severe crisis)
- **Result:** Pressure = shame = worsening symptoms
- **Avoid:** Recovery is gradual. Celebrate small wins. Be patient.

## DECISION FLOWCHART

```
Person in crisis
    ↓
Danger to self/others?
    ├─ YES → EMERGENCY
    │         • Remove means
    │         • 24/7 supervision
    │         • Safety contract
    │         • Never alone
    └─ NO → Assess symptom
             ├─ PANIC → Calm space, breathing, grounding
             ├─ PSYCHOSIS → Calm voice, don't argue, low stimulation
             ├─ SHUTDOWN → Basic care, presence, micro-goals
             └─ VIOLENCE → De-escalate, distance, group intervention

Post-crisis (all cases):
    • Supervision (24hr to 1 week)
    • Physical care (water, food, sleep)
    • Return to routine (gradually)
    • Monitor for relapse (Days 2-7 highest risk)
```

**FINAL NOTE:** Mental health crises are terrifying — for the person experiencing it and for helpers. You won't do it perfectly. That's okay. Presence, compassion, and following basic safety protocols save lives. Most people in crisis recover with time, support, and basic care. You can do this.
