summary: A skin abscess (boil) is a localized collection of pus that will not resolve with antibiotics alone — it must be drained. An undrained abscess can progress to sepsis. The procedure is simple but
  must be done with proper technique to prevent spread.
warnings:
- Abscesses near the eyes, nose bridge, or temple ('danger triangle of the face') should NOT be drained in the field — infection can spread to the brain via venous drainage
- Abscesses in the armpit, groin, or near major blood vessels require extreme caution — these areas contain major arteries and nerves
- If red streaking extends from the abscess, the patient has lymphangitis (spreading infection) — drainage is urgent but antibiotics are also critical
- Do NOT squeeze an abscess — this forces bacteria deeper into tissue
steps:
- 'IDENTIFY: a ripe abscess is red, swollen, warm, and FLUCTUANT (feels soft/fluid-filled when pressed, like a water balloon). If the abscess is still hard and diffuse, it''s not ready — apply warm compresses
  (clean cloth soaked in warm water) for 20 minutes, 4× daily for 1-3 days to bring it to a head.'
- 'STERILIZE: clean the skin over and around the abscess with iodine, alcohol, or soap and water. Sterilize your blade (heat in flame until red, cool in alcohol).'
- 'ANESTHESIA: if available, inject lidocaine around (not into) the abscess. If not available, ice the area for 5 minutes to partially numb. This WILL be painful regardless.'
- 'INCISION: using a sharp, sterile blade, make a single linear incision across the most fluctuant point of the abscess. Length: 1-2cm (enough to drain, not so large it won''t heal). Cut through the skin
  into the abscess cavity. Pus will drain immediately.'
- 'DRAINAGE: gently express pus by pressing around the cavity (not directly on it). Break up any internal walls (loculations) by gently inserting a hemostat or blunt probe and opening/spreading. Irrigate
  the cavity with clean water or dilute iodine solution.'
- 'PACKING (for larger abscesses >2cm): loosely pack the cavity with a strip of clean cloth or gauze to keep it open and draining. The wick should extend slightly from the wound. This prevents premature
  closure that traps remaining infection.'
- 'DRESSING: cover with clean absorbent dressing. Change packing and dressing daily. Re-irrigate cavity at each change. The cavity heals from the inside out over 1-3 weeks.'
- Remove packing after 2-3 days when drainage decreases. Continue warm compresses and daily dressing changes until healed.

# Abscess Incision and Drainage

A skin abscess (boil) is a localized collection of pus that will not resolve with antibiotics alone — it must be drained. An undrained abscess can progress to sepsis. The procedure is simple but must be done with proper technique to prevent spread.
