# Mobility Adaptations for Survival

## Overview

Mobility disabilities require specific adaptations but do not prevent effective survival preparation and response. This entry covers wheelchairs, crutches, canes, prosthetics, and limited mobility conditions with practical techniques for wilderness and disaster scenarios.

**Key Principle:** Adapt the environment and tools to the person, not vice versa.

## Wheelchair Users

### Terrain Assessment

**Before Moving:**
- Test surface firmness with a probe (stick, trekking pole)
- Avoid slopes >1:12 (5°) without assistance
- Identify soft surfaces (sand, mud, snow) that cause sinking
- Look for obstacles: roots, rocks >2" high, gaps >1" wide

**Surface Types:**
| Surface | Difficulty | Technique |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Paved/hard-packed | Easy | Standard propulsion |
| Gravel/crushed stone | Moderate | Slow, steady pushes; avoid spinning |
| Grass (short, dry) | Moderate | Faster speed maintains momentum |
| Grass (tall, wet) | Hard | May require pulling/assistance |
| Sand | Very Hard | Balloon tires or drag assistance |
| Mud | Very Hard | Avoid or use boards as track |
| Snow (packed) | Moderate | Ski attachments or sled conversion |
| Snow (loose) | Very Hard | Sled conversion mandatory |

### Ramp Construction

**Standard Ratio: 1:12 (1" rise per 12" length)**

**Materials:**
- Plywood sheets (3/4" minimum)
- 2x4 or 2x6 lumber for supports
- Rope for securing
- Non-slip surface (carpet, textured paint, grip tape)

**Quick Field Ramp:**
1. Measure height to overcome (e.g., 12")
2. Calculate length needed: height × 12 (12" × 12 = 144" = 12 feet)
3. Place supports every 3-4 feet
4. Secure plywood to prevent sliding
5. Add side rails (2" high minimum) to prevent wheel-off
6. Test with weight before use

**Emergency Alternatives:**
- Wide boards (>24" wide)
- Logs (split and flattened)
- Earth ramps (packed, reinforced with sticks)
- Vehicle ramps (if available)

⚠️ **NEVER exceed 1:8 slope without assistance and braking system**

### Transfer Techniques

**Wheelchair to Ground:**
1. Lock wheels
2. Position transfer board at 45° angle
3. Slide buttocks onto board
4. Walk hands down board to ground
5. Keep weight forward to prevent tipping

**Ground to Wheelchair:**
1. Position chair with locked wheels
2. Use transfer board or sturdy box/rock as step
3. Back up to chair
4. Lift using arm strength, pushing up from ground
5. Pivot onto seat

**Two-Person Lift (Emergency Evacuation):**
1. Person 1: Behind wheelchair, arms under armpits
2. Person 2: In front, hands under knees
3. Lift on count of three
4. Person 1 leads, walking backwards
5. Maintain level position to prevent sliding

### Transportation & Carrying Systems

**Wheelchair Modifications:**
- All-terrain wheels (larger diameter, treaded)
- Hand-cycle attachment for distance
- Ski/sled attachments for snow
- Flotation pontoons for water crossings
- Storage bags/panniers for gear

**Alternative Mobility:**
- Game cart/deer cart (person rides, others pull)
- Travois (sled poles attached to harness)
- Piggyback carry with special harness
- Rolling stretcher (litter with wheels)

### Shelter Design for Accessibility

**Layout Requirements:**
- 5' turning radius clear space
- 32" minimum doorway width
- Level ground (max 1:50 slope)
- Raised sleeping surface at wheelchair seat height (18-20")
- Reachable storage (no higher than 48" from floor)

**Construction:**
1. Clear and level area with tools, not just by eye
2. Use logs or boards to create raised floor
3. Build ramp access with 1:12 slope
4. Create transfer surfaces at consistent heights
5. Position essential items within 2-foot reach from seated position

### Physical Therapy & Health Maintenance

**Prevent Contractures (joint stiffness):**
- Range of motion exercises 2x daily (morning/evening)
- Hip flexors: Pull knee to chest, hold 30 seconds, repeat 5x
- Hamstrings: Straighten leg, flex foot, hold 30 seconds, repeat 5x
- Ankles: Circle foot clockwise, then counter-clockwise, 10x each

**Pressure Sore Prevention:**
- Shift weight every 15-30 minutes while seated
- Visual skin checks morning and evening
- Keep skin clean and dry
- Use cushioning (folded clothing, foam, inflatable pads)
- Immediately address any redness (early stage 1 pressure injury)

⚠️ **Pressure sores can develop in 1-2 hours and become life-threatening infections**

**Warning Signs:**
- Red area that doesn't blanch (turn white) when pressed
- Warmth, swelling, or tenderness
- Open sore or blister
- **Action:** Stop sitting on that area immediately, clean wound, cover with clean dressing

### Energy Conservation

**Pacing:**
- Travel in short bursts (15 min) with 5 min rest
- Use gloves to prevent hand blisters
- Hydrate frequently (dehydration reduces arm strength)
- Delegate high-energy tasks

**Tool Modifications:**
- Extend handles with PVC pipe for longer reach
- Use wheeled carts instead of carrying
- Create reacher/grabber from sticks and cord
- Lower work surfaces to lap level

## Crutches & Canes

### Uneven Terrain Navigation

**Four-Point Gait (Most Stable):**
1. Right crutch forward
2. Left foot forward
3. Left crutch forward
4. Right foot forward

**Three-Point Gait (Faster, One Leg Injured):**
1. Both crutches and injured leg forward
2. Good leg swings through

**Terrain-Specific Techniques:**

**Uphill:**
- Lean forward slightly
- Take smaller steps
- Lead with good leg
- Use poles at wider angle for stability

**Downhill:**
- Crutches/cane ahead first
- Lower body slowly
- Keep weight back
- Zigzag if steep

**Soft Ground (Mud, Sand):**
- Add "feet" to crutches: circular discs, duct-taped sticks arranged in tripod, tennis balls with holes
- Increase surface area to prevent sinking
- Consider trekking poles instead (larger baskets)

**Rocky/Root-Covered:**
- Plant crutch/cane in gaps between obstacles
- Test stability before weight transfer
- Use trekking poles (easier to adjust angles)

### Replacement & Improvisation

**Field Crutch from Branches:**
1. Find forked branch (Y-shape) for underarm support
2. Length: 6" shorter than armpit to ground when standing
3. Pad fork with clothing, moss, or bark
4. Smooth shaft to prevent splinters
5. Rubber/fabric wrap at bottom for grip

**Walking Stick/Cane:**
1. Shoulder-height hardwood branch
2. Diameter: 1-1.5" for comfortable grip
3. Remove bark, smooth
4. Carve grip ridges
5. Add wrist strap to prevent dropping

**Emergency Cane Tip:**
- Rubber bottle stopper
- Carved wooden point (for ice)
- Fabric wrapping (for quiet movement)
- Carabiner clip (hook over obstacles)

### Energy Conservation

**Rest Breaks:**
- Every 20-30 minutes for upper body
- Sit with legs elevated to reduce swelling
- Stretch shoulders, wrists, hands

**Reduce Trips:**
- Use backpack or shoulder bag
- Stage supplies (cache items along route)
- Batch activities (do multiple tasks in one location)

## Prosthetics

### Maintenance in Field Conditions

**Daily Inspection:**
- Check socket for cracks, sharp edges
- Inspect straps/suspension system for wear
- Examine joints for looseness
- Clean and dry socket liner
- Check alignment (ankle should be under knee)

**Cleaning Protocol:**
- Wipe socket with damp cloth daily
- Wash liner with mild soap and water
- Air dry completely before reuse (24h if possible)
- Apply talcum powder/cornstarch to reduce friction

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Excessive rubbing | Swelling or shrinkage | Add/remove socks, adjust straps |
| Socket looseness | Residual limb shrinkage | Add prosthetic socks (ply system) |
| Socket tightness | Swelling | Remove socks, elevate limb, ice |
| Pain at pressure points | Misalignment or debris | Check for objects in socket, re-align |
| Squeaking sounds | Moisture in socket | Dry thoroughly, powder interior |

### Socket Care

**Prevent Skin Breakdown:**
- Wash residual limb nightly with mild soap
- Dry completely (moisture = infection risk)
- Massage limb to improve circulation
- Apply skin protectant (petroleum jelly) to vulnerable areas

**Sock Ply System:**
- 1-ply sock = thin cotton
- 3-ply sock = thick wool
- 5-ply sock = heavy cushioning
- Adjust layers as limb volume changes throughout day

⚠️ **Never use prosthetic without socks/liner (causes skin breakdown)**

### Backup Systems

**If Prosthetic Fails:**

**Lower Limb:**
- Crutches (see above)
- Knee scooter (if available)
- Crawling with knee pads
- Modified wheelchair/cart
- Piggyback/carry by partner

**Upper Limb:**
- Adaptive tools (one-handed can opener, adaptive knife)
- Mouth-held tools (be cautious of infection)
- Feet substitution (practice untying shoes with feet)
- Partner assistance for two-hand tasks

**Prosthetic Repair Kit:**
- Duct tape (structural repairs)
- Athletic tape (padding, strap replacement)
- Zip ties (secure loose parts)
- Spare socks (multiple plies)
- Allen wrenches (adjust joints)
- Super glue (minor cracks)
- Moleskin/padding (pressure relief)

### Improvised Prosthetic Padding

**If Liner Fails:**
- Tube sock filled with cotton/fabric scraps
- Layered cloth diapers
- Cut foam sleeping pad to shape
- Plastic bag between residual limb and socket (reduces friction)
- Wool sock (moisture-wicking)

⚠️ **Monitor skin every 2-4 hours when using improvised padding**

### Activity Modifications

**Walking:**
- Shorter distances, frequent breaks
- Use trekking poles for stability
- Flat, even terrain preferred
- Remove prosthetic at rest stops to inspect limb

**Carrying Loads:**
- Use backpack (distributes weight)
- Avoid hand-carrying (affects balance)
- Keep center of gravity low
- Reduce load to 15-20% body weight
