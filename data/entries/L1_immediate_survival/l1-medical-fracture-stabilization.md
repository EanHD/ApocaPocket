summary: Comprehensive fracture assessment and temporary immobilization principles with specific splinting techniques for field stabilization.
steps:
- Assess scene safety and mechanism of injury to suspect fractures.
- Check and document distal circulation, sensation, and motor function (CSM).
- Control bleeding if open fracture present, cover wound with sterile dressing.
- Immobilize joint above and below injury site.
- Pad splint materials to prevent pressure sores and circulation compromise.
- Secure splint without excessive constriction - check for arterial blood flow.
- Reassess distal CSM after securing and every 15-30 minutes.
- Elevate injured extremity above heart level to reduce swelling.
- Apply ice/cold packs (wrapped, not direct) for 20 minutes on, 20 off.
warnings:
- Do NOT force realignment unless no distal pulse and trained to perform traction.
- Open fractures have extremely high infection risk - cover immediately, evacuate urgently.
- Suspected spinal/neck fractures require specialized immobilization - see l1-medical-spinal-precautions.
- Compartment syndrome (pressure buildup) can cause permanent damage - monitor for increasing pain.
- Never apply splint so tight that it cuts off circulation - should fit snugly but allow blood flow.

## Overview
Fractures (broken bones) require immediate immobilization to prevent further damage to bones, blood vessels, nerves, and surrounding tissues. Proper splinting reduces pain, prevents shock, and protects from complications. In survival situations, improvised splints from natural materials can be life-saving.

**Critical priorities:**
1. Life threats first (bleeding, airway, breathing)
2. Assess circulation/sensation/movement
3. Immobilize before moving victim
4. Reassess frequently

## Recognizing Fractures

### Signs and Symptoms

| Sign/Symptom | Description | Reliability |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Deformity** | Abnormal angle, shortening, or rotation | High - obvious fracture |
| **Swelling** | Rapid swelling at injury site | High - but also occurs in sprains |
| **Pain** | Severe, localized, worse with movement | Medium - subjective |
| **Loss of function** | Cannot use limb normally | High |
| **Crepitus** | Grating sound/feeling from bone ends | High - DO NOT test for this |
| **False motion** | Movement where there should be none | High - DO NOT test for this |
| **Bruising** | May develop hours later | Medium |
| **Exposed bone** | Open fracture - visible bone | Definitive |

### Mechanism of Injury (MOI)
Suspect fracture if:
- Fall from height >10 feet (3m)
- Direct blow to limb
- High-speed collision
- Twisting injury with pop/snap sound
- Crush injury

**When in doubt, treat as fracture** - immobilize and evacuate

## Types of Fractures

### Closed vs. Open

| Type | Description | Urgency | Infection Risk |
|------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Closed** | Skin intact, bone not visible | Moderate | Low |
| **Open** | Bone visible through skin or wound communicating with fracture | **URGENT** | **Very high** |

### Common Fracture Patterns

- **Simple:** Clean break, two pieces
- **Comminuted:** Multiple fragments (crushed)
- **Greenstick:** Incomplete break (common in children)
- **Spiral:** Twisting injury
- **Compression:** Vertebrae crushed (spine injury)
- **Avulsion:** Ligament pulls bone fragment off

## Step-by-Step Stabilization Protocol

### 1. Scene Safety and ABCs (First 30 seconds)
- Ensure scene is safe
- Check for life threats: severe bleeding, airway, breathing
- If spinal injury suspected, immobilize neck FIRST (see l1-medical-spinal-precautions)

### 2. Initial Assessment (1-2 minutes)
- **Expose the injury:** Cut away clothing if necessary
- **Look:** Deformity, swelling, discoloration, open wounds
- **Ask:** Pain level (1-10), ability to move
- **Mechanism:** How did it happen?

### 3. Check CSM - BEFORE Splinting (30 seconds)

**Document initial status - critical for monitoring!**

#### Circulation
- **Pulse:** Feel pulse below injury (wrist for arm, ankle for leg)
- **Capillary refill:** Press fingernail/toenail, should return to pink in <2 seconds
- **Color:** Compare to uninjured side - should be pink, not pale/blue
- **Temperature:** Should be warm, not cold

#### Sensation
- **Light touch:** Can they feel you touching fingers/toes?
- **Sharp/dull:** Can they tell difference? (use broken stick)
- **Compare:** Both sides should feel the same

#### Motor (Movement)
- **Fingers/toes:** Can they wiggle?
- **Strength:** Can they squeeze your hand or push against resistance?
- **Pain:** Does movement cause pain?

**Grade CSM as: Normal / Impaired / Absent**

**If circulation absent (no pulse, cold, blue):** Urgent - may need realignment (see below)

### 4. Control Bleeding (if open fracture)
- **Do NOT push bone back in**
- Cover with sterile gauze soaked in clean water/saline
- Apply bulky dressing around exposed bone
- Apply gentle pressure AROUND wound (not on bone)
- See l1-medical-severe-bleeding for hemorrhage control

### 5. Prepare Splint Materials

**Rigid splints (best):**
- Wooden boards, branches
- Rolled newspaper/magazines
- Cardboard
- Ski poles, tent poles
- Foam sleeping pad

**Padding:**
- Clothing, towels
- Bandanas, shirts
- Moss, grass (if clean)
- Foam

**Securing materials:**
- Bandages, cloth strips
- Belts, rope, cord
- Duct tape
- Vines (if strong and available)

**Length:** Splint must extend beyond joints above AND below fracture

### 6. Apply Splint - Immobilize Two Joints

**General principles:**
- Immobilize joint ABOVE and BELOW fracture site
- Pad bony prominences (elbows, ankles) to prevent pressure sores
- Splint in position found UNLESS no pulse
- Support limb while splinting - minimize movement
- Secure from uninjured end toward injury

**Example: Forearm fracture**
- Splint must immobilize elbow AND wrist
- Extends from upper arm to past hand
- Secure at: upper arm, forearm (above/below fracture), wrist

### 7. Secure Splint (Without Cutting Off Circulation)
- Use at least 3 ties: above fracture, below fracture, and at joints
- Should be **snug but not tight**
- Test: Can you slide one finger under ties?
- Leave fingers/toes exposed to monitor circulation

### 8. Reassess CSM - AFTER Splinting (Critical!)
- Recheck pulse, sensation, movement
- Should be same or better than before splinting
- **If worse:** Loosen splint immediately

### 9. Elevate and Ice
- Elevate limb above heart level (reduces swelling)
- Ice/cold pack: 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off
- **Do NOT** apply ice directly to skin (wrap in cloth)

### 10. Monitor and Document
- Recheck CSM every 15-30 minutes
- Write times and findings on tape/paper attached to victim
- Watch for compartment syndrome (see below)

## Special Situations

### When to Attempt Realignment

**Only realign if ALL of these are true:**
1. No distal pulse (limb will die without blood flow)
2. Severe deformity (>45° angulation)
3. Evacuation time >2 hours
4. You are trained in traction technique

**Realignment procedure:**
1. One person stabilizes limb above fracture
2. Second person grasps limb below fracture
3. Apply gentle, steady traction (pull) along long axis of bone
4. Slowly bring limb toward normal alignment
5. If significant resistance or severe pain, STOP
6. Splint in position achieved
7. Recheck CSM

**If pulse returns:** Continue with evacuation
**If pulse does not return:** This is a surgical emergency - fastest possible evacuation

### Traction Splints (Femur Fractures)

Femur (thigh bone) fractures are life-threatening - can lose 1-2 liters of blood internally.

**Indications:**
- Mid-shaft femur fracture
- Severe pain, deformity

**Improvised traction:**
1. Tie padding around ankle
2. Attach rope/cord to ankle padding
3. Secure rigid splint along leg (outside of thigh to beyond foot)
4. Apply gentle, constant pull on rope
5. Maintain traction while securing splint

**Commercial traction splints (if available):** Follow manufacturer instructions

### Open Fractures

**Immediate actions:**
1. Cover wound immediately with sterile dressing moistened with clean water
2. Do NOT attempt to push bone back under skin
3. Splint as you would closed fracture
4. Start antibiotics if available (Cephalexin 500mg or Amoxicillin 500mg every 8 hours)
5. **Evacuate urgently** - surgical debridement needed within 6-8 hours

**Infection risk is VERY HIGH** - these require hospital care

### Specific Fracture Types

#### Clavicle (Collarbone)
- Arm in sling
- Figure-8 bandage pulling shoulders back (if available)
- No splint needed

#### Humerus (Upper arm)
- Sling and swathe (bind arm to chest)
- Splint along outside of arm if very unstable

#### Elbow
- Splint in position found
- DO NOT attempt to straighten
- Check radial pulse carefully

#### Forearm/Wrist
- Splint from elbow to past fingers
- Position: Slight bend at elbow, wrist neutral

#### Hand/Fingers
- Splint in "position of function" (like holding a soda can)
- Buddy-tape broken finger to adjacent finger

#### Pelvis
- Pelvic binder or wrap sheet around pelvis
- DO NOT move victim more than absolutely necessary
- **Life-threatening internal bleeding risk** - evacuate urgently

#### Femur (Thigh)
- Traction splint if possible
- Splint to opposite leg if no traction available
- Expect severe pain and shock

#### Knee
- Splint in position found (bent or straight)
- DO NOT attempt to straighten
- Check pulses at ankle

#### Tibia/Fibula (Lower leg)
- Splint from above knee to past foot
- Pad behind knee and ankle

#### Ankle/Foot
- Splint including lower leg
- Pillow or blanket wrapped and secured works well

## Compartment Syndrome - Critical Complication

### What It Is
Pressure builds up inside muscle compartment, cutting off blood flow. Causes permanent nerve/muscle damage within 6-8 hours.

### Warning Signs (The 5 P's)
1. **Pain:** Increasing, out of proportion, not relieved by pain meds
2. **Pressure:** Tight, swollen feeling
3. **Paresthesias:** Tingling, numbness
4. **Pallor:** Pale skin
5. **Pulselessness:** Weak or absent pulse (late sign)

**Pain with passive stretch is most reliable sign** (e.g., pulling toes up causes severe calf pain)

### Action
1. Loosen all bandages and splint immediately
2. Lower limb to heart level (don't elevate)
3. **Evacuate urgently** - this is a surgical emergency
4. Do NOT apply ice

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Forgetting to check CSM before splinting
- ❌ Splint too tight (cuts off circulation)
- ❌ Not immobilizing joints above and below
- ❌ Attempting to "set" the bone (realign) when pulse is present
- ❌ Pushing exposed bone back into wound
- ❌ Not padding bony prominences
- ❌ Moving victim before splinting
- ❌ Forgetting to recheck CSM after splinting
- ❌ Not documenting findings
- ❌ Applying ice directly to skin

## Evacuation Criteria

### Immediate Evacuation (<2 hours)
- Open fracture (bone visible)
- No distal pulse
- Femur or pelvis fracture
- Multiple fractures
- Fracture with head/chest/abdominal trauma
- Suspected spinal fracture
- Compartment syndrome developing

### Urgent Evacuation (<24 hours)
- Any obvious deformity
- Severe pain not controlled by available medications
- Numbness/tingling persists after splinting
- Fracture near joint
- Child with any fracture

### Can Consider Delayed Evacuation
- Minor closed fracture (finger, toe)
- Good distal CSM
- Adequate pain control
- Stable splint
- No signs of complications

**Note:** Most fractures still require X-ray and proper orthopedic care

## Pain Management in Field

Without medications:
- Immobilization is #1 pain reliever
- Ice (20 on, 20 off)
- Elevation
- Distraction techniques

With medications:
- Ibuprofen 400-600mg every 6-8 hours (anti-inflammatory)
- Acetaminophen 500-1000mg every 6 hours
- Combine both for better effect

For severe pain (if available):
- Tramadol 50-100mg every 6 hours
- See l1-medical-basic-pharmacology for dosing

## Long-Term Field Care (If Evacuation Delayed)

### Days 1-3
- Keep splint dry and clean
- Check CSM every 4-6 hours
- Ice for first 48 hours
- Elevate when possible
- Pain should be decreasing

### After Day 3
- Swelling should peak and start decreasing
- Pain should be significantly better
- Watch for signs of infection (if open fracture)
- Begin very gentle range of motion of non-immobilized joints

### Signs of Problems
- Increasing pain after day 2-3
- Fever >38.5°C (101.3°F)
- Foul smell from wound
- Increasing redness/warmth
- Pus drainage
- Numbness/tingling develops
