summary: A penetrating chest wound that bubbles or hisses is a sucking chest wound — air enters the chest cavity and collapses the lung. Without a chest seal, tension pneumothorax develops and is fatal
  within minutes. Immediate three-sided seal or commercial chest seal required.
warnings:
- Tension pneumothorax is IMMEDIATELY LIFE-THREATENING — death within 5-10 minutes without treatment.
- If patient deteriorates AFTER sealing (worsening breathing, distended neck veins, trachea shifting, hypotension), you have tension buildup — lift one corner of the seal to release pressure ('burp' the seal), then
  reseal. Repeat every 5-10 minutes if needed.
- Check for EXIT wound — a bullet/object may have passed through the chest. BOTH entry and exit holes need sealing simultaneously.
- Do NOT remove impaled objects from the chest — stabilize in place with bulky dressings.
- Do NOT use four-sided occlusive seal - creates tension pneumothorax. ALWAYS use three-sided or vented seal.
steps:
- Identify sucking chest wound - look and listen for bubbling, hissing, or air movement through wound with breathing.
- Immediately seal wound as patient exhales forcefully - pushes air out before sealing.
- Apply three-sided seal (tape on 3 sides only, bottom edge open) OR commercial vented chest seal.
- Check for exit wound - seal both entry and exit simultaneously if present.
- Position patient semi-upright (45-60°) on injured side if possible.
- Monitor continuously for tension pneumothorax signs - every 2-5 minutes.
- If breathing worsens after sealing, burp the seal by lifting one corner briefly to release trapped air.
- Control any external bleeding around the seal.
- Evacuate immediately while monitoring - definitive care requires chest tube and surgery.

## Overview
A penetrating chest wound that bubbles or hisses is a **sucking chest wound** — air enters the pleural space (chest cavity) through the wound, collapsing the lung. This creates a **pneumothorax** (air around lung). Without immediate sealing, it progresses to **tension pneumothorax** (one-way valve effect) where air enters but cannot escape, collapsing the lung completely and shifting the mediastinum (heart and great vessels), causing death within 5-10 minutes.

**Critical timing:** Patient deteriorates rapidly. Seal within first 60 seconds if possible.

## Understanding the Mechanism

### Normal Chest Mechanics
- Chest cavity (pleural space) is normally under negative pressure
- This negative pressure keeps lungs inflated
- Diaphragm contracts → chest expands → air flows IN to lungs

### Sucking Chest Wound (Open Pneumothorax)
- Hole in chest wall breaks the seal
- Air enters pleural space through wound (path of least resistance)
- Lung collapses partially
- Breathing becomes difficult, inefficient

### Tension Pneumothorax (Life-Threatening)
- One-way valve effect: air enters but cannot escape
- Pressure builds in chest cavity
- Lung collapses completely
- Heart and great vessels shift to opposite side (mediastinal shift)
- Venous return to heart blocked
- Cardiac output drops → shock → death
- **Time to death: 5-10 minutes**

## Recognition - The "Deadly Trio"

### Sucking Chest Wound Signs

| Sign | Description | Reliability |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Visible wound** | Penetrating injury to chest (gunshot, stab, impalement, shrapnel) | Definitive |
| **Bubbling/frothing** | Blood bubbles through wound with breathing | High |
| **Hissing/sucking sound** | Audible air movement through wound | High |
| **Blood froth** | Pink, frothy blood at wound site | High |

**Location:** Any chest wound between clavicle (collarbone) and bottom of rib cage, from midline to mid-back

### Pneumothorax/Tension Pneumothorax Signs

| Finding | Open Pneumothorax | Tension Pneumothorax (CRITICAL) |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Breathing** | Difficult, rapid | Severe distress, gasping |
| **Chest movement** | Reduced on injured side | Paradoxical or absent movement |
| **Breath sounds** | Decreased/absent on injured side | Absent on injured side |
| **Neck veins** | Normal or flat | **Distended** (JVD) |
| **Trachea** | Midline | **Deviated away** from injury |
| **Skin** | Pale | Cyanotic (blue) |
| **Mental status** | Anxious | Confused, deteriorating |
| **Pulse** | Fast | Fast, weak, may be absent |
| **Blood pressure** | May be normal | **Hypotensive** (shock) |

**Key differentiator:** Distended neck veins + worsening after sealing = tension pneumothorax

## Step-by-Step Treatment Protocol

### 1. Scene Safety and ABCs (10 seconds)
- Ensure scene is safe
- Check responsiveness, breathing, circulation
- Identify life-threatening bleeding first (tourniquet/pressure)

### 2. Rapid Chest Examination (15 seconds)
- Expose chest completely (cut away clothing)
- **Look:** Visible wound? Blood? Asymmetric chest movement?
- **Listen:** Hissing/bubbling sound? Breath sounds equal both sides?
- **Feel:** Subcutaneous emphysema (Rice Krispies feel under skin)?
- **Check front AND back** - look for exit wound

### 3. Seal the Wound IMMEDIATELY (30 seconds)

**Timing is critical - do this BEFORE other interventions**

#### Materials (Use What You Have)

**Preferred (commercial):**
- Hyfin chest seal (vented, adhesive)
- Asherman chest seal (vented, adhesive)
- Any commercial vented chest seal

**Improvised (airtight materials):**
- Plastic wrap/cling film
- Plastic bag or packaging
- Credit card, ID card
- Duct tape (folded sticky-side to sticky-side for center)
- Petroleum-jelly (Vaseline) gauze
- Latex/nitrile glove (cut open)
- Aluminum foil
- Mylar emergency blanket

**Tape:**
- Duct tape (best - sticks when bloody)
- Medical tape
- Packing tape
- Any strong adhesive tape

**Size:** Must extend 2 inches (5 cm) beyond wound edges on all sides

#### Application Technique (Three-Sided Seal)

**Critical: THREE sides taped, ONE side open (creates flutter valve)**

1. **Have patient exhale forcefully** (or time with exhalation)
   - This pushes air OUT of chest before sealing
   - Critical step - reduces trapped air

2. **Place seal material over wound**
   - Cover wound completely with 2" (5cm) overlap all sides
   - Center over wound

3. **Tape THREE sides** (top, left, right) - **LEAVE BOTTOM OPEN**
   - Open side should be bottom (gravity helps drainage)
   - Use generous tape strips
   - Press firmly to create airtight seal on three sides

4. **Check seal**
   - Should flutter with breathing (air escapes on exhale, seals on inhale)
   - No air should enter wound on inhale

**Why three-sided?**
- Air can escape on exhalation (prevents tension)
- Seal closes on inhalation (prevents air entry)
- Functions as improvised one-way valve

#### Commercial Chest Seal Application

**Hyfin/Asherman type:**
1. Remove backing
2. Patient exhales forcefully
3. Apply directly to wound, pressing firmly
4. Built-in valve allows air out, not in
5. If two wounds, use two seals

**Advantages:** Stick when wet/bloody, pre-designed valve, easy to use

### 4. Check for Exit Wound (15 seconds)
- Roll patient slightly to check back
- Bullets/projectiles often exit
- **Both wounds must be sealed**
- If exit wound present, apply second seal while maintaining first

### 5. Position Patient (15 seconds)
**Best position:** Semi-upright (45-60°) on injured side
- Upright improves breathing mechanics
- Injured side down allows good lung to expand fully
- If cannot sit up: place on injured side (lateral position)
- If spinal injury suspected: maintain spinal precautions, cannot position optimally

**Do NOT lay flat** - worsens breathing

### 6. Monitor for Tension Pneumothorax (Continuous)

**Check every 2-5 minutes:**
- Breathing: Better or worse?
- Neck veins: Flat or distended?
- Mental status: Alert or deteriorating?
- Skin color: Pink or blue?
- Seal: Still adherent?

### 7. Burp the Seal (If Tension Develops)

**Signs tension is developing AFTER sealing:**
- Breathing gets WORSE (not better)
- Neck veins become distended (swollen)
- Increased confusion/agitation
- Dropping blood pressure
- Trachea deviated (neck midline shifted)

**Action - Decompress ("burp"):**
1. Lift one corner of seal briefly (2-3 seconds)
2. You'll hear/feel trapped air rush out
3. Watch for improvement in breathing
4. Reseal immediately
5. Repeat every 5-10 minutes if symptoms recur

**With commercial seal:** Follow manufacturer instructions (usually has release valve)

### 8. Control External Bleeding
- Apply pressure AROUND seal (not directly on seal)
- Use wound packing if needed (see l1-medical-wound-packing)
- Check for other injuries

### 9. Treat for Shock
- Keep warm
- Monitor vital signs
- See l1-medical-shock-recognition

### 10. Evacuate Immediately
- This is temporary field measure
- Definitive treatment requires:
  - Chest tube placement (hospital procedure)
  - Surgical repair
  - Chest X-ray
  - Possible ventilator support

## Special Situations

### Impaled Object in Chest
- **DO NOT REMOVE**
- Stabilize object in place with bulky dressings
- Seal AROUND object to create airtight seal
- Transport with object in place
- Only exception: Object prevents CPR

### Multiple Chest Wounds
- Seal largest/most bubbling wound first
- Seal all wounds found
- Check front, sides, back, armpits
- May need multiple seals

### Underwater Injuries (Diving, etc.)
- Could be air embolism in addition to pneumothorax
- Keep victim horizontal (not upright)
- 100% oxygen if available
- Rapid evacuation to hyperbaric chamber

### Blast Injury
- May have pneumothorax WITHOUT visible wound
- Blast wave causes internal lung damage
- Suspect if blast exposure + breathing difficulty
- Cannot seal (no external wound) - evacuate rapidly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Four-sided seal (completely occlusive) - creates tension pneumothorax
- ❌ Not checking for exit wound
- ❌ Seal too small (doesn't extend beyond wound edges)
- ❌ Not having patient exhale before sealing
- ❌ Laying patient flat (worsens breathing)
- ❌ Removing seal to "check" wound repeatedly
- ❌ Using non-adherent material (doesn't stick)
- ❌ Not monitoring for tension development
- ❌ Removing impaled objects
- ❌ Delaying seal application

## Field Improvisation Examples

### Plastic Wrap Method
1. Cut piece 4-6 inches square (10-15 cm)
2. Place over wound on exhalation
3. Tape three sides with duct tape
4. Leave bottom edge open

### Credit Card Method
1. Use any plastic card (credit card, ID)
2. Must be larger than wound
3. Tape three sides, leave bottom open
4. Simple and effective

### Glove Method
1. Cut glove open to make flat sheet
2. Use powder-free if possible (less irritating)
3. Tape three edges
4. Latex/nitrile both work

### Petroleum Jelly Gauze
1. Gauze soaked in Vaseline creates airtight barrier
2. Place over wound
3. Tape edges (can tape all four sides if using this material - it has some give)

## Monitoring and Documentation

### Vital Signs
- Respiratory rate: Every 2-5 minutes
- Pulse: Every 2-5 minutes
- Blood pressure: Every 5 minutes if equipment available
- Mental status: Continuous
- Oxygen saturation: If pulse oximeter available (expect low reading)

- In these cases: Position upright, high-flow oxygen if available, rapid evacuation

## Evacuation Priority

**IMMEDIATE - HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- Any sucking chest wound is life-threatening
- Transport to trauma center capable of chest tube placement/surgery
- Continue monitoring during transport
- May need repeat burping
- Keep seal in place
- Maintain position (upright/injured side)

**Helicopter evacuation preferred** for speed

**Expected hospital care:**
- Chest tube insertion
- Chest X-ray/CT
- Possible surgery
- ICU monitoring
- Possible ventilator
