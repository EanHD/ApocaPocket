summary: 'Lightning kills more people in the US than any other weather phenomenon except floods. You cannot outrun lightning (moves at 1/3 the speed of light). The only safety is proper positioning and
  shelter. If you can hear thunder, you''re in danger. ''30-30 rule'': if time between flash and thunder is <30 seconds, seek shelter. Wait 30 minutes after last thunder before resuming activity.'
warnings:
- Lightning can strike up to 10 miles from the storm — 'bolt from the blue' kills in sunny weather when storm is on the horizon
- Sheltering under a single tree is one of the most dangerous things you can do in a thunderstorm
- Metal does NOT attract lightning, but it conducts electricity well — don't hold metal objects, but metal structures (cars, buildings) are safe if you're inside
- Ground current (lightning spreading through ground) causes most injuries, not direct strikes
steps:
- 'RECOGNIZE DANGER: If you can hear thunder OR see lightning, you are in strike range. Flash-to-bang count: see lightning, count seconds until thunder. Divide by 5 = distance in miles. If <6 seconds (1
  mile), danger is imminent. Hair standing on end, tingling skin, buzzing metal objects = IMMEDIATE pre-strike warning. Drop and assume lightning position NOW.'
- 'SAFE LOCATIONS: (1) Inside a substantial building (fully enclosed, not a picnic shelter). Stay away from windows, plumbing, appliances. (2) Inside a hard-top metal vehicle (car, truck, NOT motorcycle
  or convertible). Close windows. Don''t touch metal. Lightning travels through the metal skin to ground. (3) If no shelter: low ground away from trees, avoid ridges/peaks, avoid water.'
- 'DANGEROUS LOCATIONS: (1) Open fields (you''re the tallest object). (2) Under a tree (lightning strikes tree, current travels down trunk and through ground — kills people nearby). (3) In or near water
  (water conducts electricity — exit immediately). (4) On ridges or peaks (highest points). (5) Near isolated tall objects (flagpoles, towers, single trees). (6) In tents, picnic shelters, or open-sided
  structures (no protection).'
- 'LIGHTNING POSITION (last resort, open ground with no shelter): Crouch on balls of feet (minimize ground contact), heels together, head down, hands over ears. Do NOT lie flat — this maximizes ground contact.
  Do NOT put hands on ground. This position minimizes (but does not eliminate) ground current risk. Insulate: sit on a foam pad, backpack, coiled rope — anything non-conductive. Spread group members 15-20
  feet apart (if one is struck, others can render aid).'
- 'GROUP PROTOCOL: If in a group, spread out 15-20 feet apart. If someone is struck, others are far enough away to help (and not be hit by ground current). Designate who will administer CPR if needed. Victims
  of lightning are NOT electrified — safe to touch immediately.'
- 'IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH — LIGHTNING STRIKE VICTIM: (1) Check for breathing and pulse. Lightning often stops the heart. START CPR IMMEDIATELY if no pulse (see CPR entry). (2) Lightning victims often recover
  if CPR is started quickly. (3) Check for burns (entry/exit wounds), fractures (concussive force can break bones), paralysis. (4) All lightning victims need medical evaluation (cardiac monitoring) even
  if they seem fine.'
- 'AVOIDING GROUND CURRENT: Most lightning injuries are from ground current, not direct strike. Current travels through ground in decreasing concentric circles from strike point. To minimize risk: (1) Keep
  feet together (reduces ''step potential'' — current differential between your two feet). (2) Crouch on balls of feet. (3) Avoid long conductive objects on ground (fences, pipes, rails). (4) Stay away
  from groups of trees (strike one tree, current spreads to others).'
- 'STORM SHELTER SITE SELECTION (if camping in storm-prone area): Choose low-lying areas away from tall single trees. In forest, choose area with uniformly tall trees (lightning more likely to hit the tallest).
  Avoid ridge tops, peaks, and valleys prone to flash flooding. Pitch tent 2× the height of the nearest tree away from the tree base.'
- 'LONG-TERM CAMP LIGHTNING PROTECTION: A lightning rod system is possible: metal rod or tall pole, minimum 10 feet higher than your shelter, grounded with a wire running to ground (buried 6+ feet or to
  water). This diverts strikes away from the shelter. Requires copper wire or thick metal cable. Not practical for short-term survival but critical for permanent homesteads.'

# Lightning Safety & Storm Shelter

Lightning kills more people in the US than any other weather phenomenon except floods. You cannot outrun lightning (moves at 1/3 the speed of light). The only safety is proper positioning and shelter. If you can hear thunder, you're in danger. '30-30 rule': if time between flash and thunder is <30 seconds, seek shelter. Wait 30 minutes after last thunder before resuming activity.
