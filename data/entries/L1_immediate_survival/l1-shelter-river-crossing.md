summary: Rivers kill more wilderness travelers than any other natural hazard. Fast-moving water is immensely powerful — waist-deep current can sweep you off your feet. Proper crossing technique, site selection, and knowing when NOT to cross are life-saving skills.
warnings:
- Water deeper than your knees or faster than walking pace is dangerous — consider not crossing
- Cold water saps strength rapidly — even if shallow, cold water can incapacitate you mid-stream
- Never tie yourself to a rope when crossing — if you fall, the rope pins you underwater and you drown
- Crossing alone is extremely dangerous — if possible, wait for a group or better conditions
steps:
- 'WHEN NOT TO CROSS: (1) Water opaque/muddy (cannot see bottom). (2) Debris or ice flowing in current. (3) Recent heavy rain (rivers are high and fast). (4) Glacial streams in afternoon (peak melt flow — cross in morning when lower). (5) If you would not confidently swim it, do not try to walk it. WAIT: rivers drop quickly after storms. Wait 12-24 hours if safe to do so.'
- 'SITE SELECTION: Look for: (1) Wide, shallow sections (wide = slower, shallow = safer). (2) Gravel bottom (avoid slippery rock). (3) Straight section (not bends — current is fastest on outside of bends). (4) Downstream clear of waterfalls, rapids, logjams, or undercut banks (in case you are swept away). (5) Scout 100m upstream and down. The effort is worth it.'
- 'PREPARATION: (1) Unbuckle pack straps (can shed pack if you fall). (2) Remove pants if deep (pants fill with water and drag you down). Boots ON (foot protection). (3) Use a wading staff (strong stick, chest-height, placed upstream for stability). (4) Secure critical gear (waterproof bag for electronics, documents, fire-starting materials).'
- 'SOLO CROSSING TECHNIQUE: (1) Face upstream at 45 degree angle to current. (2) Shuffle feet (do not lift — you will lose balance). (3) Move wading staff first, plant it upstream, transfer weight, then move feet. (4) If current is strong, move diagonally downstream (ferry angle) — do not fight the current, use it. (5) If you lose balance, drop pack immediately, float on back with feet downstream (protects head), swim to shore with current at an angle.'
- 'GROUP CROSSING (safest): (1) LINE ASTERN: cross single file, each person holds the person in front pack/shoulders. Strongest person leads, second-strongest at rear. Move together as a unit. (2) WEDGE: 3+ people form a wedge pointing upstream. Strongest person at apex breaks the current. Others follow in his wake. Link arms. (3) ROPED GROUP (if you have adequate rope and experience): anchor rope on shore, first person crosses with rope, secures on far side. Subsequent people clip in with carabiner, cross with rope as safety. This requires training.'
- 'CHILDREN/WEAK SWIMMERS: Carry small children in a chest carry (face-to-face hug). Weak swimmers: strongest member crosses first, sets rope, weak member clips in or crosses while holding rope.'
- 'IF YOU FALL: (1) Ditch pack immediately. (2) Roll onto back, feet downstream, toes up (protects head from rocks, feet absorb impacts). (3) Swim with current at 45 degree angle toward shore (ferrying technique). DO NOT try to stand in fast current — foot entrapment (foot wedges between rocks, current pushes you underwater) is fatal. (4) Only stand when current is slow and water is shin-deep.'
- 'COLD WATER CONSIDERATIONS: Water below 15C (60F) causes rapid heat loss. Symptoms: gasping, rapid breathing, loss of dexterity, confusion. After crossing: change into dry clothes immediately, wring out wet clothes, get active to generate heat, drink warm fluids. Hypothermia can develop even on a warm day if water is cold.'
- 'SWIM VS FORD DECISION: If river is too deep to ford but you MUST cross: SWIM it, do not wade. Swimming gives you control. Wading in deep fast water leads to falling, tumbling, panic. Swimming technique: enter upstream of your target landing, swim at 45 degree angle toward shore (current carries you downstream), crawl stroke with pack as flotation or ditch pack. Aim to land 50-100m downstream.'
