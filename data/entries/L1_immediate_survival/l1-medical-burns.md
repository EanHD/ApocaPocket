## Overview
Burns are tissue damage from heat, chemicals, electricity, radiation, or friction. Immediate proper cooling reduces tissue damage depth and pain. Key priorities: stop burning process, cool appropriately, prevent infection, assess for evacuation needs.

**Critical timing:** First 10-20 minutes determine outcome. Brain damage from shock/hypoxia begins in 4-6 minutes for severe burns.

## Burn Classification

### By Depth

| Depth | Layer Affected | Appearance | Pain Level | Healing |
|-------|---------------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Superficial** (1st degree) | Epidermis only | Red, dry, no blisters | High (nerve endings intact) | 3-7 days, no scarring |
| **Partial-Thickness** (2nd degree) | Epidermis + part of dermis | Red, wet, blistered, blanches with pressure | Very high (nerve endings exposed) | 2-3 weeks, possible scarring |
| **Full-Thickness** (3rd degree) | All skin layers + subcutaneous | White/brown/black, leathery, dry, does NOT blanch | Low/none (nerves destroyed) | Requires grafting, severe scarring |
| **4th Degree** | Extends to muscle/bone | Charred, black | None | Requires amputation consideration |

### By Extent: Rule of 9s (Adults)

| Body Part | % Body Surface Area (BSA) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Head/neck | 9% |
| Each arm | 9% (18% both) |
| Chest | 9% |
| Abdomen | 9% |
| Upper back | 9% |
| Lower back | 9% |
| Each leg (front) | 9% (18% both legs front) |
| Each leg (back) | 9% (18% both legs back) |
| Genitals | 1% |

**Quick estimate:** Patient's palm (including fingers) = 1% BSA

**Children:** Head is proportionally larger (18% for infant vs 9% adult)

## Step-by-Step Protocol

### 1. Stop the Burning Process (First 30 seconds)
- **Fire:** Stop, drop, and roll; smother flames with blanket
- **Hot liquid:** Remove soaked clothing immediately (unless stuck to skin)
- **Chemical:** Brush off dry chemical powder, then flush
- **Electrical:** Ensure power source is OFF before touching victim
- **Remove:** Clothing, jewelry, watches, rings BEFORE swelling starts

### 2. Scene Safety and ABCs (30 seconds)
- Ensure scene is safe
- **Airway:** Check for inhalation injury signs (see below)
- **Breathing:** Listen for wheezing, stridor
- **Circulation:** Check pulse, assess for shock

### 3. Assess Burn Severity (1-2 minutes)
- **Depth:** Superficial/partial/full-thickness
- **Extent:** Use Rule of 9s or palm method
- **Location:** Face, hands, feet, genitals, joints are critical
- **Circumferential:** Burns that encircle limb/chest

### 4. Cool the Burn (10-20 minutes)
**For thermal burns:**
- Cool running water (15-25°C / 59-77°F)
- **Duration:** 10-20 minutes minimum
- **Do NOT use:** Ice, ice water (causes vasoconstriction, tissue damage, hypothermia)
- **Large burns:** Cool in intervals, watch for hypothermia (shivering, confusion)
- **Stop cooling if:** Patient shivers, burn >20% BSA (risk of hypothermia)

**For chemical burns:**
- Remove contaminated clothing (wear gloves!)
- Flush with copious water 20-45 minutes continuously
- For dry chemicals: Brush off first, THEN flush
- Special chemicals (phenol, white phosphorus) may need specific neutralization

**For electrical burns:**
- Do NOT cool excessively - internal damage often worse than visible
- Assume cardiac injury, check pulse

### 5. Pain Management
- **Remove heat:** Cooling provides significant pain relief
- **Position:** Elevate burned extremity above heart
- **Medication (if available):**
  - Adults: Ibuprofen 400-600mg + Acetaminophen 500-1000mg every 6-8 hours
  - Children: Ibuprofen 10mg/kg every 6-8 hours

### 6. Cover and Protect (After cooling)
- **Clean, dry, non-adherent dressing** or clean cloth
- **Do NOT break blisters** - they protect from infection
- Plastic wrap (cling film) is acceptable if clean
- **Avoid:** Cotton balls, fluffy materials that shed fibers
- Wrap loosely, do not constrict

### 7. Monitor and Maintain
- **Circulation:** Check pulses below burn every 30 minutes (circumferential burns)
- **Shock:** Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, mental status
- **Hydration:** For burns >10% BSA, begin oral rehydration (see l1-medical-oral-rehydration-recipe)
- **Hypothermia:** Keep victim warm after cooling phase

## Immediate Evacuation Criteria (Within 2-6 hours)

**Evacuate immediately if ANY:**
- Burns >10% BSA (adult) or >5% BSA (child)
- Any full-thickness (3rd degree) burn
- Burns to face, hands, feet, genitals, or major joints
- Circumferential burns (encircling limb/chest/neck)
- Electrical or chemical burns
- Inhalation injury suspected
- Age <5 or >60 years with burns >5% BSA
- Burn + other trauma (fracture, head injury)
- Altered mental status, signs of shock

## Inhalation Injury Warning Signs

**Suspect inhalation injury if:**
- Burned in enclosed space (house fire, car)
- Singed nasal hairs, eyebrows, or facial hair
- Soot in mouth, nose, or sputum
- Hoarse voice, stridor (high-pitched breathing sound)
- Coughing, wheezing
- Shortness of breath

**Action:** Immediate evacuation - airway swelling can be rapid and fatal

## Special Burn Types

### Chemical Burns
- Continue flushing 20-45 minutes
- Remove all contaminated clothing
- **Strong acids/alkalis:** Can continue burning for hours
- **Hydrofluoric acid (HF):** Extremely dangerous, requires calcium gluconate gel
- Do not neutralize (acid with base or vice versa) - creates heat

### Electrical Burns
- Entry and exit wounds may look minor, but internal damage is severe
- Assume cardiac dysrhythmia - check pulse, consider CPR
- Muscle damage causes kidney risk from myoglobin release
- Increased fluid needs
- Mandatory evacuation

### Radiation Burns (Sunburn-type)
- Cool compresses
- Moisturizing lotion (aloe vera)
- NSAIDs for pain
- Usually not urgent unless severe blistering

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Applying ice or ice water (causes additional tissue damage)
- ❌ Breaking blisters (increases infection risk)
- ❌ Applying butter, oils, toothpaste, or home remedies (traps heat, increases infection)
- ❌ Using fluffy cotton materials (fibers stick to wound)
- ❌ Inadequate cooling duration (<10 minutes)
- ❌ Overcooling large burns (causes dangerous hypothermia)
- ❌ Removing stuck clothing (leave it, cool around it)
- ❌ Not removing jewelry before swelling
- ❌ Underestimating electrical burns (look minor, are major)

## Ongoing Care (First 24-48 Hours)

### Dressing Changes
- Change daily or if soaked/dirty
- Gently clean with saline or clean water
- Do NOT scrub or remove stuck material
- Reapply non-adherent dressing

### Infection Watch
- Increased pain, redness, swelling after day 2-3
- Pus, foul odor
- Fever >38.5°C (101.3°F)
- Red streaks from wound

### Fluid Requirements (Burns >10% BSA)
**Parkland Formula (first 24 hours):**
- 4 mL × weight (kg) × % BSA burned
- Give half in first 8 hours, half over next 16 hours
- Example: 70kg person with 20% burn = 4 × 70 × 20 = 5,600 mL
  - First 8 hours: 2,800 mL
  - Next 16 hours: 2,800 mL

**Oral rehydration if conscious and able to drink**

## Summary Table: Burn Severity Quick Reference

| Severity | Characteristics | Treatment | Evacuation |
|----------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| **Minor** | Superficial, <10% BSA, no critical areas | Cool, dress, monitor | Usually no |
| **Moderate** | Partial-thickness 10-20% BSA, or small full-thickness | Cool, dress, fluids, pain meds | Likely yes |
| **Major** | >20% BSA, full-thickness >5%, face/hands/feet/genitals, circumferential, electrical, inhalation | Aggressive cooling, IV fluids, emergency evac | **Always** |

## Long-Term Considerations
- Scarring and contractures (especially across joints)
- Physical therapy to maintain range of motion
- Psychological trauma (especially facial burns)
- Infection remains risk for weeks
- Nutrition needs increased 2-3× normal for healing

## When NOT to Treat in Field
- Chemical exposure you cannot identify - evacuate without extensive washing if unsure
- Radiation exposure from nuclear source - decontamination protocols needed
- Extensive burns with limited resources - focus on comfort, rapid evacuation
