summary: 'The Rule of 3s: 3 minutes without air, 3 hours without shelter (in harsh conditions), 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food. This framework guides ALL survival decisions. Most people prioritize
  wrong — they look for food when they''re hours from hypothermia. This entry is the master checklist.'
warnings:
- Panic kills faster than exposure — force yourself to STOP, BREATHE, OBSERVE, PLAN before acting
- 'The #1 mistake: starting a task (building shelter) then abandoning it for another (looking for water) — finish critical tasks before starting new ones'
- Dehydration impairs judgment within 12-24 hours — if you're thirsty, your decision-making is already compromised
- Fire is psychologically important but not always survival-critical — don't waste daylight on fire if you need shelter before dark
- Group dynamics change priorities — more people = more needs but also more capabilities

## TIMELINE-BASED PLANNING

### FIRST HOUR (Minutes 0-60) — STABILIZE & ASSESS

**Immediate Actions:**
- **Minutes 0-5 — INJURY TRIAGE:** Check yourself and group for life-threatening injuries:
  - Severe bleeding (arterial = spurting blood) → Tourniquet/pressure NOW
  - Not breathing → CPR if recently occurred, otherwise assess if viable
  - Chest wounds → Seal with plastic/tape (sucking chest wound)
  - Head injury with unconsciousness → Monitor, stabilize neck
  - Shock symptoms (pale, cold, rapid pulse) → Lie flat, keep warm
- **Minutes 5-15 — ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT ASSESSMENT:**
  - **Cold/Wet:** Hypothermia timeline = 1-6 hours depending on conditions
  - **Heat/Sun:** Heat stroke timeline = 3-8 hours without shade/water
  - **Incoming weather:** Check sky, wind direction, temperature trend
  - **Nightfall:** How many hours until dark? This is your hard deadline for shelter.
  - **Wildlife/Human threats:** Any immediate dangers? Signs of predators, hostile humans?
- **Minutes 15-60 — CRITICAL DECISION: STAY OR MOVE?**
  - **STAY if:** Weather threatening, injured, lost with no idea where help is, search party likely
  - **MOVE if:** Know location of help < 2 hours away, current location is deadly (avalanche zone, flood plain), weather permits
  - **DEFAULT RULE:** If in doubt, stay put. Moving people are harder to find and often get more lost.

**First Hour Checklist:**
- [ ] All injuries identified and stabilized
- [ ] Shelter priority determined (URGENT vs can wait)
- [ ] Stay/move decision made
- [ ] Immediate threats identified and avoided
- [ ] Mental state assessed (yourself and group — panic, shock, denial?)

### HOURS 1-3 — SHELTER PRIORITY

**Build Minimum Viable Shelter (MVS):**
Not a perfect shelter — a shelter that prevents death through the coming night/day.

**Cold/Wet Environment MVS:**
- Insulated floor (evergreen boughs, leaves, dry debris — 1-2 feet thick)
- Wind-blocking walls (branches, bark, debris)
- Waterproof roof (overlapping bark, large leaves, tarp if available)
- Small enough to trap body heat (just big enough to lie down)
- Entry away from prevailing wind
- Time: 1-2 hours for solo, 30-60 min with help

**Hot/Sun Environment MVS:**
- Shade structure (tarp, rock overhang, leafy branches)
- Elevated or dug-in to escape ground heat
- Ventilation (don't seal yourself in)
- Near water source if possible
- Time: 30-60 minutes

**Shelter Checklist:**
- [ ] Chosen location: flat, dry, away from hazards (dead trees, flood zones, animal trails)
- [ ] Floor insulation complete (critical in cold)
- [ ] Wind/rain protection functional
- [ ] Size tested (lie down to verify fit)
- [ ] Entry/exit clear and accessible
- [ ] **TASK COMPLETED** — Do not abandon shelter building for other tasks

### HOURS 3-6 — WATER ASSESSMENT

**You have ~72 hours before dehydration is life-threatening, BUT cognitive decline starts in 24 hours.**

**Water Source Identification:**
- **Visual scan:** Valleys, green vegetation, animal trails converging, birds in morning/evening
- **Audio:** Listen for running water (sound carries in quiet)
- **Terrain:** Water flows downhill, collects in low areas
- **Distance:** Ideal = 5-15 minute walk (close enough to access frequently, far enough to avoid bugs/flooding)

**Initial Water Procurement:**
- If source is clean (mountain stream, clear spring) → Drink immediately to restore function
- If source is questionable → Plan purification (boiling requires fire, see next phase)
- Collect water in containers (bottles, bark folded into pouch, plastic bags, hollowed wood)
- **DO NOT DRINK UNPURIFIED WATER** unless you're already dying of thirst (risk calculation: giardia in 1-2 weeks vs death from dehydration in 3 days)

**Water Checklist:**
- [ ] Source located within reasonable distance
- [ ] Accessibility assessed (safe approach, year-round flow?)
- [ ] Quality assessed (clear vs murky, moving vs stagnant, upstream contamination?)
- [ ] Initial procurement completed (at least 1-2 liters if possible)
- [ ] Purification plan established (fire for boiling, filter, chemical, or desperate raw consumption)

### HOURS 6-12 — FIRE ESTABLISHMENT

**Fire Provides:** Warmth, water purification, signaling, psychological comfort, cooking, predator deterrent.

**Fire is NOT urgent if:**
- Weather is warm
- Water is safe to drink without boiling
- You have adequate insulation/shelter
- **Daylight is running out and shelter is incomplete** (finish shelter first!)

**Fire Starting Process:**
1. **Gather materials FIRST** (most people fail here — they try to start fire without prep):
   - **Tinder:** Dry grass, inner bark (cedar, birch), pine needles, char cloth, bird nest — needs to catch spark (fist-sized bundle)
   - **Kindling:** Pencil-thick dry twigs, feather sticks (wood shavings still attached), resinous wood — burns fast and hot (two armfuls)
   - **Fuel:** Wrist-thick to arm-thick dry wood — sustains fire (large pile, will burn faster than you expect)
2. **Fire lay:** Teepee (easy to start) or log cabin (sustains better) — start small, build up
3. **Ignition:** Lighter/matches (use wisely, only 1-2 attempts), ferro rod (practice before crisis), friction (bow drill, hand drill — takes skill and energy), flint and steel, fire plow
4. **Nursing:** Once tinder catches, add kindling gradually (too much smothers, too little starves), blow gently to add oxygen

**Fire Checklist:**
- [ ] Fire site selected (clear area, away from shelter and overhead branches, wind-protected)
- [ ] Tinder, kindling, fuel collected in quantity (triple what you think you need)
- [ ] Fire lay built and ready
- [ ] Ignition source tested (if ferro rod, practice your technique)
- [ ] Fire established and sustained (once started, keep feeding it)
- [ ] Water set to boil if needed (use containers that can withstand heat)

### HOURS 12-24 — SIGNALING & ORGANIZATION

**Signaling (if rescue is desired):**
- **Visual signals:**
  - Signal fire (3 fires in triangle = universal distress, or large smoke generator)
  - Bright cloth/tarp hung in open area
  - Ground signals: SOS in rocks/logs (minimum 3 meters tall per letter)
  - Mirror/reflective material (signal aircraft)
- **Audio signals:**
  - 3 of anything = distress (3 whistle blasts, 3 gunshots, 3 shouts)
  - Save energy — signal when you hear aircraft or see movement
- **Stay visible:** Open areas, high ground, contrast against environment

**Camp Organization:**
- **Work areas:** Fire, food prep, tool making (keep separate for safety)
- **Sleep area:** Insulated, dry, away from fire (sparks)
- **Storage:** Hang food (bears), protect from rain, organize tools
- **Waste:** Latrine 200+ feet from water, bury feces, burn trash if possible

**Psychological Maintenance:**
- **Set micro-goals:** "By dark, I will have 3 more armfuls of firewood"
- **Do something productive every hour** — idle time breeds panic
- **Celebrate wins:** Shelter built? Fire started? Acknowledge the achievement.
- **If in group:** Check-in on emotional state, assign tasks, maintain hope

**Signaling & Organization Checklist:**
- [ ] Rescue decision made (hide vs seek)
- [ ] If seeking rescue: visible signals established
- [ ] Camp layout organized (work, sleep, storage, waste zones)
- [ ] Firewood stockpiled (for night and morning — collect during daylight)
- [ ] Mental state stabilized (yourself and group)
- [ ] Evening routine planned (fire maintenance, shelter improvements, rest)

### HOUR 24+ — SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING

**Water Security:**
- Establish water purification routine (boil 10+ minutes, let cool)
- Create water storage (multiple containers)
- Identify backup water sources
- Plan for weather (will rain provide collection opportunity?)

**Food Reconnaissance:**
- **Do NOT prioritize food yet** — you have 2-3 weeks before starvation is critical
- **Opportunistic foraging:** If you see obvious edibles (berries you know, fish in stream, small game), take advantage
- **Energy calculation:** Calories spent hunting/foraging vs calories gained — if negative, skip it for now
- **Set traps/snares if skilled** — passive food acquisition while you focus on other tasks

**Shelter Improvements:**
- Reinforce weak points (roof leaks, drafts)
- Add insulation (more debris, thatching)
- Expand if needed (drying area, storage)
- Prepare for weather changes (drainage if rain expected)

**Mental Health Protocols:**
See [l1-strategy-mental-health-acute] for detailed crisis response. Quick checklist:
- [ ] Basic needs being met (reduces panic)
- [ ] Productive tasks completed (provides sense of control)
- [ ] Social connection maintained if in group (isolation worsens mental state)
- [ ] Sleep attempted (exhaustion impairs judgment)
- [ ] Emotional release allowed (crying, anger are normal — acknowledge and move forward)

## DECISION MATRIX: ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC PRIORITIES

### Arctic/Winter (Below Freezing):
1. **Shelter** (hypothermia = 1-3 hours)
2. **Fire** (critical for survival and water melting)
3. **Water** (melt snow, never eat snow directly = hypothermia)
4. Signaling
5. Food (can wait longer in cold)

### Desert (Hot/Dry):
1. **Shelter** (shade = critical, heat stroke in 3-6 hours)
2. **Water** (equal priority with shelter, dehydration faster in heat)
3. Fire (less urgent, may skip for first 24-48 hours)
4. Signaling
5. Food

### Temperate Forest (Mild):
1. Shelter (if rain/cold expected; otherwise can wait)
2. Water
3. Fire
4. Signaling
5. Food

### Tropical/Jungle (Hot/Wet):
1. **Shelter** (rain protection critical, hypothermia possible if wet)
2. Water (usually abundant)
3. Fire (difficult due to dampness, start early)
4. Signaling
5. Food (more available but also more competition from wildlife)

### Coastal/Maritime:
1. **Shelter** (wind, salt spray, tides)
2. Water (saltwater is poison — find freshwater or rain collection)
3. Fire (critical for signaling passing ships)
4. Signaling (coastguard, aircraft, boats)
5. Food (abundant if you can fish/forage tidal zones)

## GROUP DYNAMICS CONSIDERATIONS

### Solo Survival:
- **Advantage:** Only yourself to care for
- **Disadvantage:** No backup if injured, no one to keep watch, slower work
- **Priority shift:** Shelter can be smaller, signaling more critical (no one to send for help)

### 2-3 People:
- **Advantage:** Shared watch, faster building, skill diversity, emotional support
- **Task division:** One builds shelter, one gathers materials, one scouts water
- **Communication:** Check in every 30-60 minutes (prevent getting separated)

### 4+ People:
- **Advantage:** Significant force multiplier, specialization possible
- **Challenges:** More conflict potential, resource needs increase, decision-making slower
- **Leadership:** Designate coordinator for first 24 hours (even if temporary)
- **Task teams:** Shelter team (2-3 people), water team (1-2), fire team (1), security/watch (rotate)

### Children or Injured in Group:
- **Shelter priority increases** (vulnerable members need protection first)
- **Assign non-physical tasks:** Child can organize materials, sort tinder, keep fire going
- **Psychological care:** Children sense adult panic — stay calm, explain actions
- **Injured members:** Stabilize first, then assign sedentary tasks (tool making, fire watch)

## MENTAL HEALTH PROTOCOLS

### Acute Crisis Response (First Hours):

**PANIC ATTACK (rapid breathing, racing heart, "I'm going to die" feeling):**
1. **Physical intervention:** Sit or lie down immediately
2. **Breathing:** 4 counts in, 4 counts hold, 4 counts out, 4 counts hold (box breathing) — repeat for 3-5 minutes
3. **Grounding:** Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste
4. **Reframe:** "This feeling is temporary. I am not dying. My body is reacting to stress."
5. **Action:** Once calm enough, start first checklist item (observation, injury check)

**SHOCK/DENIAL (numbness, disbelief, "this isn't real"):**
1. **Acknowledge:** "This is real. I am in a survival situation."
2. **Physical sensation:** Touch ground, feel heartbeat, splash cold water (bring awareness to body)
3. **Immediate task:** Start STOP-BREATHE-OBSERVE checklist (action combats dissociation)
4. **Social:** If in group, voice your state: "I'm feeling shocked, give me 5 minutes" (prevents isolation)

**RAGE/AGGRESSION (anger at situation, blaming others, destructive impulses):**
1. **Physical release (safe):** Yell, hit ground with stick, aggressive gathering (stomp on branches) — release energy without harming self/others
2. **Cooling off:** Separate from group briefly if needed (5-10 minutes)
3. **Cognitive:** "Anger won't change the situation. Channel this into productive work."
4. **Action:** Assign high-energy task (gather firewood, clear campsite)

**DESPAIR/HOPELESSNESS ("we're all going to die," giving up):**
1. **Counter:** "I don't know if I'll survive long-term, but I CAN survive the next hour. That's all I need to focus on."
2. **Micro-goals:** Break tasks into tiny steps (don't think "build shelter," think "gather 10 sticks")
3. **Wins:** Acknowledge ANY progress ("I got water. That's a win.")
4. **Social:** Stay close to others, voice the feeling (group can provide hope when individual can't)

### Long-Term Mental Health (Beyond 24 Hours):
- **Routine:** Set daily schedule (wake, tasks, meals, sleep) — predictability reduces anxiety
- **Purpose:** Assign everyone a role (including children, elderly) — feeling useful combats despair
- **Connection:** Daily group check-in (even if just 2 people) — isolation is psychologically corrosive
- **Future focus:** Make plans (when we get out, first thing I'll do is...) — hope requires vision of future
- **Emotional release:** Crying, venting, grieving losses is NORMAL and HEALTHY — allow it, then move forward
- **Warning signs:** Suicidal thoughts, complete withdrawal, reckless behavior, psychosis → See [l1-medical-mental-health-crisis]

## COMMON FATAL MISTAKES (AND HOW TO AVOID THEM)

### 1. PANIC PARALYSIS OR PANIC RUNNING
- **Mistake:** Freezing in place doing nothing, OR running blindly away from danger without thinking
- **Result:** Hypothermia while standing still, or getting more lost/injured while running
- **Avoid:** Force STOP-BREATHE-OBSERVE protocol. If you must move, do so deliberately with a plan.

### 2. WRONG PRIORITY SEQUENCE
- **Mistake:** Looking for food when you're hours from hypothermia; building elaborate shelter when you need immediate wind break; starting fire before having materials gathered
- **Result:** Wasting critical time and energy on low-priority tasks while actual threats worsen
- **Avoid:** Always assess: "What will kill me FASTEST?" Address that first. Use Rule of 3s.

### 3. TASK-SWITCHING (Unfinished Critical Tasks)
- **Mistake:** Start building shelter, then abandon it to look for water, then start fire, then back to shelter — nothing gets completed
- **Result:** Night falls with no shelter, no fire, no water — you have 3 half-done projects instead of 1 done
- **Avoid:** Finish critical tasks before starting new ones. Exception: True emergency interrupts (injury, weather)

### 4. DEHYDRATION-IMPAIRED JUDGMENT
- **Mistake:** Knowing you're thirsty but postponing water procurement ("I'll get water after I finish this")
- **Result:** After 12-24 hours of dehydration, decision-making is impaired — you make more mistakes, creating cascade of failures
- **Avoid:** Drink water whenever available. If no water, make water procurement the immediate priority after shelter.

### 5. FIRE OBSESSION
- **Mistake:** Spending hours trying to start fire with poor materials or inadequate skill, while daylight burns away and shelter remains unbuilt
- **Result:** Night falls, no fire AND no shelter = hypothermia
- **Avoid:** If fire is proving difficult, reassess priority. Shelter can keep you alive without fire. Fire without shelter is much less effective.

### 6. OVEREXERTION (Sweat = Death in Cold)
- **Mistake:** Working so hard on shelter/tasks that you sweat heavily in cold weather
- **Result:** Wet clothing in cold = accelerated hypothermia
- **Avoid:** Pace yourself. Remove layers before working hard, add them back during rest. Keep base layers dry.

### 7. WATER CONTAMINATION DESPERATION
- **Mistake:** Drinking visibly contaminated water (stagnant, downstream of corpse, full of feces) on Day 1
- **Result:** Severe diarrhea/vomiting within 6-24 hours = accelerated dehydration and weakened state
- **Avoid:** You have ~72 hours before dehydration is critical. Use that time to purify water or find cleaner source.

### 8. MOVING WHEN LOST
- **Mistake:** Walking for hours trying to find "the trail" or "the road" when disoriented
- **Result:** More lost, exhausted, now in unfamiliar area with night falling
- **Avoid:** If lost, STAY PUT (exception: immediate danger like avalanche zone). Make camp, signal, wait for rescue.

### 9. SOLO EXPLORATION (Group Settings)
- **Mistake:** One group member wanders off to "scout water" or "get firewood" without telling others
- **Result:** Person gets lost, group panics, resources wasted on search
- **Avoid:** Buddy system always. Tell others where you're going and when you'll return. Set turnaround time.

### 10. IGNORING MENTAL HEALTH
- **Mistake:** Suppressing fear, panic, grief; pushing through without acknowledging psychological state
- **Result:** Breakdown at worst possible time (middle of critical task), or poor decisions made from unprocessed emotions
- **Avoid:** Acknowledge feelings ("I'm scared, and that's okay"). Allow brief emotional release. Then refocus on tasks.

**MASTER RULE:** When in doubt, return to the Rule of 3s. What will kill you in 3 minutes (air/breathing)? 3 hours (exposure/shelter)? 3 days (water)? 3 weeks (food)? Address threats in that order.

**The first 24 hours set the foundation for everything that follows. Get these priorities right, and you've bought yourself time to solve the next problems. Get them wrong, and nothing else matters.**

# First 24 Hours — Priority Decision Tree

The Rule of 3s: 3 minutes without air, 3 hours without shelter (in harsh conditions), 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food. This framework guides ALL survival decisions. Most people prioritize wrong — they look for food when they're hours from hypothermia. This entry is the master checklist.

## DECISION FRAMEWORK CHECKLIST

Before making ANY survival decision, run through this 30-second assessment:

- [ ] **STOP** — Literally stop moving. Sit down if safe.
- [ ] **BREATHE** — 3 deep breaths. Calm your nervous system.
- [ ] **OBSERVE** — Weather, terrain, injuries, resources, threats (5 minutes minimum).
- [ ] **PLAN** — What will kill you fastest? Address that first.
- [ ] **ACT** — Complete one priority task before starting another.
