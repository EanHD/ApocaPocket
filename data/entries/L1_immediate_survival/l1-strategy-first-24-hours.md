summary: 'The Rule of 3s: 3 minutes without air, 3 hours without shelter (in harsh conditions), 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food. This framework guides ALL survival decisions. Most people prioritize
  wrong — they look for food when they''re hours from hypothermia. This entry is the master checklist.'
warnings:
- Panic kills faster than exposure — force yourself to STOP, BREATHE, OBSERVE, PLAN before acting
- 'The #1 mistake: starting a task (building shelter) then abandoning it for another (looking for water) — finish critical tasks before starting new ones'
- Dehydration impairs judgment within 12-24 hours — if you're thirsty, your decision-making is already compromised
- Fire is psychologically important but not always survival-critical — don't waste daylight on fire if you need shelter before dark
steps:
- 'MINUTE 1-5 — STOP AND ASSESS: Are you injured/bleeding? Handle life-threatening injuries FIRST (see medical entries). Check for: broken bones, severe bleeding, head injury, chest pain, difficulty breathing.
  If any: treat before anything else.'
- 'MINUTE 5-15 — ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT ASSESSMENT: What will kill you fastest? Cold/wet = hypothermia (you have 1-6 hours depending on severity). Hot/sun = heat stroke (you have 3-8 hours). No immediate
  threat = you have time to plan. Check weather: is rain/storm/nightfall coming? This sets your time limit.'
- 'HOUR 1 — SHELTER OR MOVE?: If conditions are harsh (cold, wet, windy, extreme heat), shelter is THE priority. If conditions are mild AND you know help/better location is nearby (< 2 hours walk), consider
  moving. DEFAULT: Stay put and shelter. Search parties find stationary people; moving people get more lost.'
- 'HOUR 1-3 — BUILD MINIMUM VIABLE SHELTER: Not a perfect shelter — a shelter that keeps you alive through the night. Cold environments: insulation (debris hut, snow cave). Hot: shade (tarp, rock overhang,
  leafy branches). Wet: waterproof roof and raised bed. See shelter entries for techniques. FINISH THIS before starting anything else.'
- 'HOUR 3-6 — WATER ASSESSMENT: Locate water source within walking distance. You have ~3 days before dehydration is critical, but cognitive decline starts in 24 hours. If water is abundant: great, address
  fire. If water is scarce: this becomes your next major task after shelter.'
- 'HOUR 6-12 — FIRE: If you have shelter and water identified, fire is next. Fire provides: warmth, water purification (boiling), signaling, psychological comfort, cooking. Gather tinder/kindling/fuel BEFORE
  attempting ignition. See fire entries. In warm climates with safe water sources, fire is less urgent.'
- 'HOUR 12-24 — SIGNALING: If you want to be found: stay visible and create signals (mirror, bright cloth, rock/log patterns spelling SOS, signal fire ready to light). If you want to hide: ignore this.
  Most survival situations = you want rescue.'
- 'HOUR 24+ — WATER PROCUREMENT & FOOD PLANNING: With shelter/fire secured, focus on sustainable water (purification, collection). Food is not urgent for days, but if you see easy opportunities (fish trap
  near camp, obvious edible plants), take them. Foraging/hunting comes AFTER core needs.'
- 'PSYCHOLOGICAL RULE: Do something productive every hour — gather firewood, improve shelter, organize gear. Idle time breeds panic. Set micro-goals: ''by sunset I will have X done.'' Celebrate small wins.'
- 'DECISION TREE SUMMARY: Injury → Shelter (if weather threatens) → Water location → Fire (if cold or need purification) → Signaling → Food. Adjust based on environment: desert = water becomes equal to
  shelter. Arctic = shelter and fire are tied for first.'

# First 24 Hours — Priority Decision Tree

The Rule of 3s: 3 minutes without air, 3 hours without shelter (in harsh conditions), 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food. This framework guides ALL survival decisions. Most people prioritize wrong — they look for food when they're hours from hypothermia. This entry is the master checklist.
