# Asthma - Severe Attack Management

## Overview

Asthma affects 25 million Americans (8% of population). Severe attacks can be fatal within minutes to hours. **Quick recognition and treatment save lives.**

**CRITICAL:** A severe asthma attack that doesn't respond to treatment can progress to respiratory arrest in 30-60 minutes.

## Attack Recognition & Severity

### Peak Flow Zones (If Meter Available)

| Zone | Peak Flow | Symptoms | Action |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **GREEN** | 80-100% personal best | Breathing well, no symptoms | Continue routine meds |
| **YELLOW** | 50-80% personal best | Coughing, wheezing, chest tight | Use rescue inhaler, monitor |
| **RED** | <50% personal best | Severe symptoms, struggling | Emergency treatment NOW |

### Severity Assessment (Without Peak Flow Meter)

**MILD Attack:**
- Wheezing, coughing
- Can speak full sentences
- Slight breathlessness
- Heart rate <100 bpm
- **Action:** 2-4 puffs albuterol, monitor

**MODERATE Attack:**
- Loud wheezing
- Can only speak short phrases (3-5 words)
- Using accessory muscles (neck, ribs visible)
- Heart rate 100-120 bpm
- Sitting upright, leaning forward
- **Action:** 4-6 puffs albuterol, repeat every 20 min, consider oral steroids

**SEVERE Attack:**
- Severe wheezing OR silent chest (no air movement)
- Can only speak 1-2 words at a time
- Struggling to breathe, exhausted
- Heart rate >120 bpm
- Cyanosis (blue lips, nail beds)
- Altered consciousness (confusion, drowsiness)
- **Action:** EMERGENCY - aggressive treatment, evacuate immediately

⚠️ **DANGER SIGN:** "Silent chest" (no wheezing despite distress) means airways are so constricted that NO air is moving. This is life-threatening.

## Emergency Treatment Protocol

### Step 1: Rescue Inhaler (Albuterol/Salbutamol)

**Dosing:**
- **Initial:** 4-6 puffs (90 mcg per puff = 360-540 mcg total)
- **Repeat:** Every 20 minutes for 1 hour (maximum 3 rounds)
- **Total max:** 18 puffs in first hour

**Proper technique:**
1. **Shake inhaler** (5-10 seconds)
2. **Exhale fully** (empty lungs)
3. **Seal lips around mouthpiece** (or use spacer)
4. **Press canister + inhale slowly and deeply** (3-5 seconds)
5. **Hold breath** (10 seconds if able, 5 seconds minimum)
6. **Wait 30-60 seconds between puffs**

**With spacer (better delivery):**
- Attach spacer to inhaler
- Spray 1 puff into spacer
- Breathe normally from spacer (5-6 breaths)
- Repeat for each puff

### Step 2: Oral Corticosteroids (If Available)

**Prednisone dosing:**
- **Adults:** 40-60 mg once (8-12 tablets of 5mg)
- **Children 6-11 yrs:** 1-2 mg/kg (30-40 mg typical)
- **Children <6 yrs:** 1-2 mg/kg (10-20 mg typical)

**Timing:** Give early in severe attacks (works in 4-6 hours)

**Alternatives:**
- Methylprednisolone (Medrol): 40-60 mg
- Dexamethasone: 8-12 mg (longer-acting, 1 dose may be enough)

### Step 3: Positioning

**Tripod position (most effective):**
- Sit upright, lean forward
- Elbows on knees or table
- Head slightly forward
- Opens chest, reduces work of breathing

**DO NOT lie flat** - worsens breathing, increases panic

### Step 4: Breathing Techniques

**Pursed-lip breathing:**
1. Breathe in slowly through nose (2 seconds)
2. Pucker lips (like blowing out candles)
3. Breathe out slowly through pursed lips (4-6 seconds)
4. **Benefit:** Creates back-pressure, keeps airways open

**Diaphragmatic breathing:**
1. Hand on belly, hand on chest
2. Breathe deeply so belly rises (not chest)
3. Exhale slowly
4. **Benefit:** More efficient breathing, reduces panic

## Inhaler Alternatives (No Electricity/Medical Supplies)

**CRITICAL:** These are FAR inferior to real inhalers, but may help in desperate situations.

### 1. Strong Coffee or Tea (Caffeine = Mild Bronchodilator)
- **Dose:** 2-3 cups strong coffee (200-300mg caffeine)
- **Mechanism:** Caffeine is chemically similar to theophylline (asthma med)
- **Effect:** Mild, takes 30-60 minutes
- **Benefit:** May reduce severity 10-15%

### 2. EpiPen (Epinephrine) - If Available
- **Dose:** 0.3mg IM injection (thigh)
- **Effect:** Powerful bronchodilator, works in 5-10 minutes
- **Duration:** 15-20 minutes
- **Repeat:** Can give second dose after 5-10 minutes if no improvement
- **⚠️ WARNING:** Causes rapid heart rate, anxiety, tremors - use only for life-threatening attacks

### 3. Steam Inhalation (Warm Moist Air)
- **Method:** Lean over bowl of hot water, towel over head
- **Benefit:** Loosens mucus, may soothe airways
- **⚠️ WARNING:** Can worsen some people's asthma (cold air asthmatics)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** These alternatives are NOT substitutes for real asthma medications. Use only in desperate scenarios when no inhaler available.

## Status Asthmaticus (Life-Threatening)

**Definition:** Severe asthma attack that does NOT respond to standard treatment (albuterol + steroids).

**Recognition:**
- Attack lasting >1 hour despite treatment
- Worsening symptoms despite repeated inhaler use
- Extreme fatigue (unable to breathe, exhausted)
- Cyanosis (blue lips, fingernails)
- Confusion, drowsiness (hypoxia)
- Silent chest (no wheezing = no air movement)

**Emergency protocol:**
1. **Continue albuterol:** 6-8 puffs every 20 minutes
2. **High-dose steroids:** Give oral steroids if not already given
3. **Oxygen if available** (any source - tank, concentrator, even automotive oxygen)
4. **Position:** Tripod position, do NOT lie down
5. **Prepare for CPR:** If they lose consciousness, they may arrest
6. **EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY:** This is life-threatening, needs ICU care

⚠️ **SURVIVAL RATE:** Status asthmaticus has 5-10% mortality even WITH hospital care. Without ICU, survival is unlikely if attack doesn't break.

## When to Attempt Rescue Breathing vs CPR

**Rescue breathing ONLY (no chest compressions):**
- If they stop breathing BUT have a pulse (check carotid artery 10 seconds)
- Give 1 breath every 5-6 seconds (10-12 breaths/minute)
- Check pulse every 2 minutes

**Full CPR (compressions + breaths):**
- If no pulse AND not breathing
- 30 compressions : 2 breaths
- Continue until help arrives or person recovers

**Special considerations for asthma:**
- Lungs are very stiff during attack → hard to inflate
- May need more force for rescue breaths (but don't overdo - risk pneumothorax)
- Focus on chest compressions (they generate some air movement)

## Trigger Avoidance

**Common triggers:**

| Trigger | Avoidance Strategy |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Smoke** | Stay upwind of fires, avoid smoke-filled areas |
| **Cold air** | Cover mouth/nose with scarf, breathe through nose |
| **Dust/allergens** | Avoid dusty areas, clean bedding regularly |
| **Exercise** | Pre-treat with 2 puffs albuterol 15 min before activity |
| **Stress/panic** | Practice breathing exercises, stay calm |
| **Strong odors** | Avoid perfumes, chemicals, strong-smelling foods |
| **Weather changes** | Be prepared during temp swings, humidity changes |

**In survival scenarios:**
- Fire smoke is MAJOR trigger → stay upwind, use mask/cloth over face
- Dusty shelters → clean area, wet cloth to reduce dust
- Cold nights → pre-treat with inhaler before sleep

## Medication Storage & Rationing

**Albuterol inhaler storage:**
- **Shelf life:** 18-24 months if stored properly
- **Temperature:** Store at room temp (59-77°F / 15-25°C)
- **Avoid:** Freezing (clogs), extreme heat (>120°F degrades propellant)
- **Test:** Spray 1 puff in air - should produce fine mist (not sputtering)

**Puff counting:**
- Standard inhaler: 200 puffs
- If rationing: Use only when needed (not preventatively)
- **Minimum effective dose:** 2 puffs for mild, 4-6 for moderate

**Oral steroid storage:**
- **Prednisone:** Stable for 5+ years if kept dry and cool
- **Storage:** Airtight container, avoid moisture
- **Rationing:** Use only for severe attacks (prevents resistance, limits side effects)

---

## Prevention Strategies

**Daily management:**
1. **Controller inhaler** (if available): Use daily even when feeling fine
2. **Avoid triggers:** Smoke, dust, cold air, allergens
3. **Monitor symptoms:** Watch for early warning signs (cough, tight chest)
4. **Peak flow tracking:** Test daily, know your personal best
5. **Stay hydrated:** Dehydration thickens mucus

**Emergency preparedness:**
- Carry rescue inhaler AT ALL TIMES
- Have backup inhaler (in car, at work, in go-bag)
- Know your triggers and avoid them
- Practice tripod position and breathing techniques when healthy
- Teach family/friends how to recognize severe attacks

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Waiting too long to use inhaler:** Use at first sign of symptoms
2. ❌ **Not shaking inhaler:** Medication settles, poor delivery without shaking
3. ❌ **Rapid shallow breaths:** Worsens attack, wastes energy
4. ❌ **Lying flat during attack:** Makes breathing harder
5. ❌ **Overusing rescue inhaler without steroids:** Doesn't address inflammation
6. ❌ **Panic:** Worsens breathing, increases oxygen demand
7. ❌ **Ignoring "silent chest":** This is LIFE-THREATENING, not "getting better"

---

## Evacuation Priorities

**Evacuate immediately if:**
- Severe attack not improving after 1 hour of treatment
- Blue lips, fingernails (cyanosis)
- Confusion, drowsiness (hypoxia)
- Unable to speak (can't complete single words)
- Silent chest (no wheezing = no air movement)
- Person collapsing, losing consciousness

**Transport considerations:**
- Keep person upright (tripod position)
- Continue inhaler treatment during transport (every 20 min)
- Monitor closely for respiratory arrest (be ready for CPR)
- Cold air may worsen attack → cover mouth/nose

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **Severity indicators:** Can't speak = moderate, blue lips = severe, silent chest = life-threatening
2. ✅ **Albuterol dosing:** 4-6 puffs every 20 min for 1 hour (up to 18 puffs)
3. ✅ **Steroids early:** Give prednisone 40-60mg in severe attacks (works in 4-6 hours)
4. ✅ **Tripod position:** Sit upright, lean forward, elbows on knees
5. ✅ **"Silent chest" = emergency:** No wheezing means no air moving - this is life-threatening

**Asthma attacks can escalate quickly. Early aggressive treatment and trigger avoidance are key to survival.**
