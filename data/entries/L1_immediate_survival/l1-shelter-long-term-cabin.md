summary: A log cabin is the simplest permanent shelter that can be built with only an axe. A basic 10×12 foot single-room cabin requires 60-80 logs, 2-4 weeks of work for 2 people, and provides shelter
  for years. This overview covers the essential concepts.
warnings:
- Site selection is critical — avoid flood plains, avalanche paths, dead-tree zones (widowmakers), and swampy ground
- Green logs shrink as they dry — expect 1-2 inches of settling per wall foot over the first year. Build door and window frames with settling gaps at top.
- A cabin without a proper chimney is a carbon monoxide death trap — never seal a cabin completely if using fire inside
- Log work is the most dangerous part of homesteading — dropped logs crush limbs and kill. Work carefully, never alone.
steps:
- 'SITE: level ground or slight slope for drainage. South-facing for passive solar heat. Near water but above flood level. Protected from prevailing wind by terrain or trees. 100+ straight trees within
  hauling distance.'
- 'FOUNDATION: lay large flat rocks or rot-resistant logs (cedar, locust) on the ground as sills. Elevate the cabin floor 6-12 inches above grade to prevent rot and moisture. A gravel bed under the foundation
  improves drainage.'
- 'LOG SELECTION: straight, consistent-diameter trees 6-10 inches at the butt. Conifers (pine, spruce, fir) are ideal — straight, light, easy to work. For a 10×12 cabin: 40-50 wall logs (14-16 feet for
  long walls, 12-14 feet for short walls) plus 15-20 for roof, floor, and furniture.'
- 'NOTCHING: saddle notch is simplest — scoop a half-round notch in the bottom of each log to fit over the log below. Alternate butt/tip ends to keep walls level. Each log sits in the notch of the one below
  it. Chink gaps with moss, clay, or wood strips.'
- 'WALLS: build up 8-10 rounds for ~7-foot wall height. Cut door opening after walls are up (easier than framing as you go). Cut window openings. Frame openings with vertical boards pinned to log ends —
  leave 2 inches at top for settling.'
- 'ROOF: simplest is a gable roof with ridge pole. Two forked posts support a ridge pole at the peak. Rafters (4-6 inch poles) lean from ridge to wall plates at 30-45° angle. Cover with split shakes (split
  thin slabs from straight-grained logs), bark slabs, or thatch. Layer like shingles — overlap 50%. Overhang walls by 12-18 inches for rain protection.'
- 'FLOOR: split logs flat-side-up, fitted tightly together. Or pack dirt floor with clay (more practical and faster). A dirt/clay floor is warmer than you''d think if elevated above grade.'
- 'CHINKING: fill gaps between logs with a mix of clay, dried grass, and water (daub). Or use moss packed tightly, then sealed with clay. Re-chink annually as logs settle. Inside walls can be smoothed with
  clay plaster.'
- 'DOOR: build from split planks held together with Z-bracing (two horizontal boards and one diagonal). Hang with wooden pin hinges or leather strap hinges. Fit loosely to allow for settling.'
- 'A cabin built well lasts 30-50+ years. The critical maintenance: keep the roof intact, re-chink as needed, ensure drainage away from foundation, replace any rotting ground-contact logs.'
