summary: Field management of suspected spinal cord injuries with manual stabilization, log-roll techniques, and improvised immobilization to prevent permanent paralysis.
steps:
- Suspect spinal injury based on mechanism - falls >10 feet (3m), vehicle accidents, diving, blunt head/neck trauma, unconsciousness.
- Immediately stabilize head and neck in neutral position - manual inline stabilization.
- Assess neurological status - sensation, movement, pain in all extremities.
- Tell patient DO NOT MOVE - explain spinal injury risk.
- If immediate danger (fire, water), use emergency drag maintaining neutral spine alignment.
- For non-emergency moves, use log-roll technique with minimum 3-4 people.
- Apply improvised cervical collar - rolled towel, SAM splint, or rigid materials.
- Immobilize entire spine on firm surface - backboard or door.
- Monitor airway continuously - be prepared to log-roll if vomiting.
- Check distal CSM (circulation, sensation, motor) every 15 minutes.
- Maintain body temperature - hypothermia worsens outcomes.
- Evacuate with spinal precautions maintained - this requires advanced care.
warnings:
- ANY movement of unstable spinal injury can cause permanent paralysis or death.
- Absence of pain or numbness does NOT rule out spinal injury - mechanism of injury is key indicator.
- Do NOT remove motorcycle/sports helmet unless airway compromised - requires two-person technique.
- Do NOT apply excessive traction to neck - neutral position only.
- Flexion, extension, or rotation of spine is catastrophic - maintain strict alignment.
- Children have proportionally larger heads - pad under shoulders to maintain neutral.

## Overview
Spinal cord injuries are devastating - they can cause permanent paralysis, loss of sensation, respiratory failure, and death. **Secondary injury** from improper handling kills or paralyzes victims who might have recovered. Field management focuses on preventing additional damage through strict immobilization and safe movement techniques.

**Critical concept:** The initial trauma causes primary injury. Improper handling causes secondary injury. Your goal is to prevent secondary injury.

## Spinal Anatomy Quick Reference

**Vertebral regions:**
- Cervical (C1-C7): Neck - most vulnerable
- Thoracic (T1-T12): Upper/mid back - relatively protected by ribs
- Lumbar (L1-L5): Lower back - common injury site
- Sacral (S1-S5): Pelvis

**Injury level determines effect:**
- C1-C4: Respiratory muscles affected - cannot breathe without support
- C5-C7: Quadriplegia (all four limbs)
- T1-L2: Paraplegia (legs only)
- Below L2: Variable leg/bowel/bladder function

## When to Suspect Spinal Injury

### High-Risk Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Risk Level | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Fall from >10 feet (3m) | **HIGH** | Height = kinetic energy |
| Motor vehicle accident | **HIGH** | Any significant impact |
| Diving/shallow water | **VERY HIGH** | Classic C-spine injury |
| Direct blow to head/neck/back | **HIGH** | Blunt force trauma |
| Ejection from vehicle | **VERY HIGH** | Multiple impact sites |
| Rollover accident | **HIGH** | Compression/rotation forces |
| Pedestrian struck | **HIGH** | Multiple trauma |
| Motorcycle crash | **HIGH** | High speed, minimal protection |
| Found unconscious | **HIGH** | Unknown mechanism |
| Blast injury | **MODERATE** | Shockwave + debris |
| Lightning strike | **MODERATE** | Muscle spasm can fracture |
| Hanging/strangulation | **HIGH** | Cervical injury |

**Age modifiers:**
- Elderly (>65): Higher risk even with minor falls
- Children: Different injury patterns (proportionally larger heads)

### Clinical Signs

**Definite spinal injury (treat as such):**
- Visible deformity of spine
- Numbness/tingling in extremities
- Weakness or paralysis
- Loss of bowel/bladder control
- Priapism (persistent erection in males - classic sign)
- Neurogenic shock (low BP + slow heart rate + warm skin)
- Pain in neck/back
- Difficulty breathing without chest injury

**May have spinal injury:**
- Altered mental status (cannot assess symptoms)
- Intoxicated (unreliable exam)
- Distracting injuries (pain elsewhere masks spinal pain)
- High-risk mechanism + any complaint

**Rule of thumb:** When in doubt, immobilize

## Neurological Assessment (BEFORE and AFTER any movement)

### Motor Function (Movement)
**Upper extremities:**
- "Squeeze my hands" (C7-T1)
- "Give me thumbs up" (C6-C7)
- Can they lift arms?

**Lower extremities:**
- "Push your feet against my hands" (plantar flexion - S1)
- "Pull your toes toward your nose" (dorsiflexion - L4-L5)
- Can they wiggle toes?

### Sensory Function (Feeling)
- Light touch all four extremities
- Can they feel sharp vs dull?
- Compare both sides (should be equal)

### Pain/Spine Tenderness
- "Does your neck hurt?"
- "Does your back hurt?"
- Palpate spine gently (if accessible) - tenderness indicates possible injury

**Document as:**
```
Motor: Normal / Weak / Absent - Upper / Lower
Sensory: Normal / Decreased / Absent - Upper / Lower  
Pain: Y / N - Location: _____
```

**Recheck after any movement or intervention**

## Manual Inline Stabilization (MIS)

**The foundation of spinal care - do this IMMEDIATELY**

### Technique
1. **Approach from above victim's head** if possible
2. **Place hands on both sides of head**
   - Palms over ears
   - Fingers spread along jaw/skull
   - Thumbs at back of head
3. **Hold in neutral position**
   - Face forward
   - No flexion (chin to chest)
   - No extension (head tilted back)
   - No rotation (turned left/right)
   - No lateral bend (ear to shoulder)
4. **Gentle, firm pressure** - do not pull/traction
5. **Maintain until immobilization device applied**

**If victim is face-down:**
- Stabilize in position found UNLESS airway compromised
- If must turn, use log-roll (see below)

**If head is at angle:**
- Gently move toward neutral IF no resistance
- If resistance, pain, or muscle spasm: STOP - immobilize in position found

## Emergency Movement (Immediate Danger Only)

**Move ONLY if:**
- Fire, explosion, chemical hazard
- Rising water, incoming tide
- Unstable structure collapse imminent
- Must access airway (not breathing)
- Active combat/violence zone

### Technique 1: Clothes Drag (1 rescuer)
1. Grasp victim under shoulders, supporting head/neck
2. Pull in direction of spine's long axis (head first)
3. Maintain head/neck as stable as possible
4. Short distance only (<20 feet)

### Technique 2: Blanket/Tarp Drag (2 rescuers)
1. Log-roll victim onto blanket (see log-roll technique)
2. One rescuer stabilizes head/neck
3. Second rescuer pulls blanket
4. Better control than clothes drag

## Non-Emergency Movement: Log-Roll Technique

**Requires MINIMUM 3 people (4-5 ideal)**

### Roles
- **Rescuer 1 (Lead):** Stabilizes head/neck, calls commands
- **Rescuer 2:** At shoulders/upper torso
- **Rescuer 3:** At hips/pelvis
- **Rescuer 4 (optional):** At legs
- **Rescuer 5 (optional):** Places backboard

### Steps
1. **Position team on same side of victim**
2. **Rescuer 1 stabilizes head** and explains procedure to victim
3. **Victim's arms placed at sides** or one arm across chest
4. **On Lead's command: "Ready... Roll"**
5. **Roll as single unit** - spine stays straight
6. **No twisting** - shoulders and hips move together
7. **Place backboard/door behind victim**
8. **On command, roll back onto board**
9. **Secure victim to board**

**Commands should be clear:**
- "On three, we roll toward me. One, two, three, ROLL."
- Everyone moves together, no one leads

## Improvised Cervical Collar

**Purpose:** Limits neck flexion/extension/rotation
**NOT a substitute for manual stabilization initially**

### Materials
- SAM splint (ideal)
- Rolled towels/blankets
- Stiff cardboard
- Padded clothing
- Multiple triangular bandages
- Foam sleeping pad cut to shape

### SAM Splint Collar
1. Cut/fold SAM splint to C-shape
2. Mold to fit from chin to shoulders
3. Extend from ear to ear
4. Wrap around neck
5. Secure with tape/bandage (not too tight - check carotid pulse)
6. Should limit but not completely prevent movement

### Towel Roll Collar
1. Roll towel into 4-inch (10cm) cylinder
2. Place horseshoe shape around neck
3. Chin rests on front of towel
4. Secure with tape or bandages around forehead and chest

**Check:** Should not compress airway or restrict breathing

## Full Spinal Immobilization

### Backboard/Rigid Surface
**Options:**
- Commercial backboard
- Door removed from hinges
- Wide boards lashed together
- Camping cot frame
- Skis/poles lashed together

**Padding needed:**
- Behind head (if adult) - maintains neutral
- Under shoulders (if child) - compensates for large head
- Behind knees - reduces lumbar lordosis, more comfortable
- Along sides - prevents rolling

### Securing to Board
**Strap/secure at:**
1. Forehead/across collar - prevents up/down movement
2. Chest - across clavicles or sternum
3. Pelvis - across iliac crests
4. Legs - above knees and at ankles

**Materials:**
- Climbing webbing
- Rope
- Belts
- Duct tape (multiple wraps)
- Torn cloth strips (multiple layers)

**Should be:** Snug but not restrictive - check breathing

### Head Blocks (Improvised)
- Rolled clothing on each side of head
- Rocks/sandbags in stuff sacks
- Foam pads
- Water bottles
- Tape across forehead to board

## Helmet Removal (Two-Person Technique)

**Remove helmet ONLY if:**
- Helmet interferes with airway management
- Helmet is loose and does not immobilize
- Cannot immobilize spine with helmet on
- Victim requires CPR

**Do NOT remove if helmet fits well and spine can be immobilized**

### Removal Steps
1. **Rescuer 1:** Stabilize helmet/head from below
   - Hands along jaw/skull
   - Support weight of head through helmet
2. **Rescuer 2:** Cut/remove chin strap
3. **Rescuer 2:** Gently spread helmet sides
4. **Rescuer 2:** Slowly slide helmet off
   - Tilt back slightly to clear nose
   - Tilt forward to clear back of head
5. **As helmet clears, Rescuer 1 transitions to manual inline stabilization**
6. **Rescuer 2 applies cervical collar**

**Sports helmets with face mask:** Cut face mask bolts to allow airway access without removing helmet

## Monitoring During Immobilization

**Check every 15-30 minutes:**
- Neurological status (motor/sensory) - document changes
- Breathing adequacy - chest rise, rate, effort
- Skin color - pale/blue indicates respiratory compromise
- Collar tightness - should not compress airway
- Restraints - not too tight, allow breathing
- Position - maintaining neutral alignment

**If victim vomits:**
- Log-roll entire board to side (maintain spinal alignment)
- Clear airway
- Return to supine position

## Special Situations

### Children
- Proportionally larger head requires padding under shoulders/torso
- Otherwise, neck flexes forward (not neutral)
- Pad entire torso 1-2 inches to achieve neutral alignment

### Pregnant Women (Late Pregnancy)
- Uterus compresses vena cava when supine
- Tilt entire board 15-30° to LEFT side
- Use rolled blankets under right side of board
- Maintains spinal alignment while improving circulation

### Water Rescue
- Stabilize in water if possible before removal
- Float victim onto backboard while in water
- Maintain neutral spine during extraction
- See l1-medical-drowning-rescue

## Evacuation Considerations

**All suspected spinal injuries require hospital evaluation:**
- X-ray/CT scan to rule out fracture
- MRI if neuro symptoms
- Neurosurgical consultation if fracture confirmed

**Transport method:**
- Helicopter preferred (less movement, faster)
- Ambulance on firm backboard
- Vehicle only if no other option - smooth road, slow speed
- Walking/carrying should maintain immobilization

**During transport:**
- Continue monitoring
- Maintain body temperature
- IV access if trained/available
- High-flow oxygen if available

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Not suspecting injury based on mechanism
- ❌ Trusting "I feel fine" after high-risk mechanism
- ❌ Moving victim before stabilization
- ❌ Log-rolling with too few people (<3)
- ❌ Not maintaining neutral alignment during movement
- ❌ Applying traction (pulling) on neck
- ❌ Hyperextending neck to open airway (use jaw thrust instead)
- ❌ Removing helmet unnecessarily
- ❌ Collar too tight (compresses airway/vessels)
- ❌ Not padding appropriately for body type
- ❌ Forgetting to reassess neuro status after movement

## Clearing the Spine (When Immobilization NOT Needed)

**Can clear spine (no immobilization) if ALL criteria met:**
- No high-risk mechanism
- No distracting injuries
- Normal mental status (alert, sober)
- No neck/back pain
- No neurological symptoms
- No midline spine tenderness
- Full range of motion without pain

**If ANY criteria not met:** Immobilize
