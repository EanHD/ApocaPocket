summary: Handling suspected spinal cord injuries to prevent paralysis in field conditions.
steps:
- 'Suspect spinal injury in: falls, vehicle accidents, diving injuries, blunt head
  trauma.'
- Tell the patient to stay still — do not move them unless immediate danger.
- Manually stabilize head and neck in neutral position (inline stabilization).
- If patient must be moved, use log-roll technique with 3+ people.
- Improvise cervical collar from SAM splint, rolled towel, or clothing.
- Monitor airway — if vomiting occurs, log-roll to side maintaining alignment.
warnings:
- Moving a patient with spinal injury can cause permanent paralysis.
- Absence of pain does not rule out spinal injury — mechanism matters.
- Helmet removal requires two-person technique to maintain alignment.
- If CPR is needed, airway management takes priority over spinal precautions.
