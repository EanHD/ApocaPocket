# Urban Navigation Grid-Down - No GPS Wayfinding

## Overview

**When GPS fails (EMP, satellites down, phone batteries dead), urban navigation becomes survival-critical.** Unlike wilderness, cities have man-made navigation aids (street signs, building numbers, cardinal-facing streets) but also unique challenges (obstructed sight lines, similar-looking blocks, psychological disorientation).

**Average person without GPS:**
- Gets lost within 1-2 miles of familiar territory (30-45 minutes)
- Walks in circles (lateral drift = 15-20° without visual reference)
- Makes poor decisions under stress (panic, exhaustion, dehydration)

**Navigation skills required:**
- Cardinal direction finding (sun, shadows, stars, street patterns)
- Distance estimation (pacing, time, landmarks)
- Route planning (primary + 2 alternates)
- Situational awareness (memorization, mapping, backtracking)

**Survival principle:** Get from Point A to Point B safely and efficiently without getting lost, injured, or compromised by threats.

## Pre-Movement Planning (10-20 minutes)

### Determine Your Destination

**Critical info:**
- [ ] Exact address or intersection (not just "downtown" - too vague)
- [ ] Latitude/longitude if possible (written down before phones die)
- [ ] Landmark description ("red brick building next to fire station")
- [ ] Rally point (if separated from group)

**Estimate distance:**
- Use pre-disaster knowledge (how long did it take by car?)
- Rule of thumb: Walking = 3 mph average, urban = 2-2.5 mph (obstacles, navigation)
- 5 miles = 2-2.5 hours walking, 3-4 hours with navigation/obstacles

### Map Acquisition & Study

**Best sources (in order of value):**
1. **Paper road map** (gas station, visitors center, bookstore)
   - Never runs out of battery
   - Whole city visible at once
   - Can mark routes, notes

2. **Printed map from internet** (before disaster)
   - Google Maps screenshot (print before grid-down)
   - Include 2-3 miles around your route (detour planning)

3. **Hand-drawn map** (from memory or local knowledge)
   - Major streets, landmarks, intersections
   - North arrow (always mark north)
   - Scale (approximate distance between landmarks)

4. **Mental map** (memorization)
   - Major streets (names, directions)
   - Landmarks (parks, rivers, tall buildings)
   - General direction (north/south/east/west of current position)

**No map available?**
- Ask locals (if safe and friendly)
- Follow major streets (lead to city center or highways)
- Use navigation techniques below (sun, shadows, street patterns)

### Route Planning

**Primary route:**
- Main roads (easier navigation, more landmarks)
- Avoids high-risk areas (industrial, riot zones, flood plains)
- Multiple waypoints (intersections, landmarks every 0.5-1 mile)

**Alternate route #1:**
- Parallel streets (1-2 blocks over)
- Use if primary blocked (debris, violence, fire)

**Alternate route #2:**
- Completely different approach (different major street)
- Use if both primary and alternate #1 blocked

**Mark routes on map:**
- Primary = blue
- Alternate #1 = green
- Alternate #2 = orange
- Avoid zones = red X

## Cardinal Direction Finding

### Sun Position (Most Reliable, Day)

**Solar navigation basics:**
- Sun rises in EAST, sets in WEST (approximately)
- At noon (local solar time), sun is due SOUTH (Northern Hemisphere)
- Shadow points NORTH at noon (Northern Hemisphere)

**Shadow stick method (accurate within 5-10°, 15 min setup):**

1. **Place vertical stick** in ground (3-4 feet tall)
2. **Mark shadow tip** (place stone, scratch ground)
3. **Wait 15 minutes**
4. **Mark new shadow tip** (shadow has moved)
5. **Draw line between two marks** (this is WEST to EAST)
6. **Perpendicular line = NORTH to SOUTH**

```
        N
        ↑
        |
  W ←---+---→ E
        |
        ↓
        S

   🌞 Sun moves EAST → WEST
   Shadow moves WEST → EAST
```

**Quick sun method (less accurate, but instant):**
- Morning (6am-10am): Sun = East (shadow = West)
- Noon (11am-1pm): Sun = South (shadow = North)
- Afternoon (2pm-6pm): Sun = West (shadow = East)

**Seasonal adjustment:**
- Summer: Sun rises NE, sets NW (further north)
- Winter: Sun rises SE, sets SW (further south)
- Spring/Fall: Sun rises E, sets W (true east/west)

**Watch method (if you have analog watch):**
1. Hold watch horizontal
2. Point HOUR hand at sun
3. Halfway between hour hand and 12 = SOUTH (Northern Hemisphere)

Example: 4pm, hour hand points at sun, halfway between 4 and 12 = 8 = South

### Star Navigation (Night)

**North Star (Polaris) - Northern Hemisphere:**
1. Find Big Dipper (7 stars, looks like a pan)
2. Locate the "pointer stars" (the two stars forming outer edge of pan)
3. Draw imaginary line through pointer stars (upward from pan)
4. Follow line 5x the distance between pointer stars
5. Bright star = Polaris (North Star)
6. Polaris = TRUE NORTH (within 1° accuracy)

**Polaris height above horizon = your latitude:**
- Horizon level (0°) = Equator
- 45° up = 45°N latitude (e.g., Minneapolis, Portland)
- Very high (89°) = North Pole

**Southern Cross (Southern Hemisphere):**
1. Find Southern Cross (4 stars, looks like a kite)
2. Draw line through long axis (top to bottom star)
3. Extend line 4.5x the length of the cross
4. Point on horizon = approximate SOUTH

**Orion's Belt (visible both hemispheres):**
- Three stars in a row (Orion's Belt)
- Rises in EAST, sets in WEST
- Useful for general orientation (not precise north/south)

### Street Grid Patterns

**Many US cities use cardinal-facing grids:**
- Major streets run N-S or E-W
- Numbered streets often run one direction (e.g., N-S)
- Named streets run perpendicular (e.g., E-W)

**Examples:**
- **Manhattan:** Avenues = N-S (numbered 1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
                Streets = E-W (numbered 1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
- **Chicago:** Streets = N-S (State St = 0, west streets = W, east streets = E)
             Avenues = E-W (Madison St = 0, north = N, south = S)

**How to determine orientation:**
1. Find street sign (read name/number)
2. Walk 1 block (note if numbers increase/decrease)
3. Increasing numbers = heading North or East (typically)
4. Decreasing numbers = heading South or West (typically)

**Exceptions:** Not all cities use this system (older cities, European layouts often non-cardinal).

### Building Shadows (Urban Sun Tracking)

**Tall buildings cast long shadows:**
- Morning: Shadows point WEST (sun in East)
- Noon: Shadows point NORTH (sun in South)
- Afternoon: Shadows point EAST (sun in West)

**Use for quick orientation:**
- Stand in street, look at shadow of building
- Shadow direction = opposite of sun
- Determine cardinal direction (see sun position above)

### Satellite Dishes (Fixed North Alignment)

**In Northern Hemisphere:**
- Satellite dishes point SOUTH (toward equator, where satellites orbit)
- Look at roof-mounted dishes (common on homes, businesses)
- Dish points = South, behind you = North

**Not 100% reliable:**
- Some dishes point SE or SW (different satellites)
- But generally accurate within 30-45° (better than guessing)

## Distance Estimation

### Pace Count Method

**Concept:** Count your steps, convert to distance.

**Calibrate your pace:**
1. Measure 100 meters or 100 yards (football field, known distance)
2. Walk naturally, count every time LEFT foot hits ground (or every step, your choice)
3. Record pace count (e.g., 60 paces for 100 meters = 1 pace per 1.67 meters)

**Standard paces (average adult):**
- 120 paces = 100 meters (short stride)
- 100 paces = 100 meters (normal stride)
- 80 paces = 100 meters (long stride)

**In use:**
- Count paces as you walk
- Every 100 paces = ~100 meters = 0.06 miles
- Mark on beads, paper, or mental count

**Challenges:**
- Urban obstacles (stairs, crowds, debris) = pace changes
- Fatigue = stride shortens (re-calibrate every mile)
- Terrain (uphill = shorter stride, downhill = longer stride)

### Time-Distance Method

**Average walking speed:**
- Flat pavement, no obstacles: 3 mph (1 mile = 20 minutes)
- Urban environment (intersections, obstacles): 2-2.5 mph (1 mile = 24-30 minutes)
- Carrying heavy load (40+ lbs): 1.5-2 mph (1 mile = 30-40 minutes)

**How to use:**
1. Note start time (watch, phone, sundial)
2. Walk to destination
3. Note end time
4. Calculate: Distance = Speed × Time

**Example:**
- Walked 90 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Average speed = 2 mph (urban)
- Distance = 2 mph × 1.5 hours = 3 miles

### Landmark Estimation

**Use known distances:**
- City blocks (typically 1/10 mile or ~100-150 meters in US cities)
- 10 blocks = 1 mile
- Tall building visible from 5-10 miles (depending on height, terrain)

**Horizon distance (on flat ground):**
- Eye level 5-6 ft tall = horizon is ~3 miles away
- If you can see a building, it's <10 miles (usually <5 miles in cities)

## Urban Navigation Techniques

### Major Street Following

**Strategy:** Stick to major streets (wide, well-marked, easier to track).

**Advantages:**
- Fewer turns (reduces disorientation)
- More landmarks (businesses, street signs)
- Straight-line travel (efficient)

**Disadvantages:**
- More visible (less tactical if avoiding threats)
- Crowded (more people = more confrontation risk)
- May require detours (blocked, dangerous areas)

**How to execute:**
1. Identify major street on map (or ask locals)
2. Follow street until waypoint (intersection, landmark)
3. Turn onto next major street (perpendicular or toward destination)
4. Repeat until destination

### Landmark Chaining

**Strategy:** Navigate from landmark to landmark (visible waypoints).

**High-visibility landmarks:**
- Tall buildings (skyscrapers, towers, steeples)
- Water towers (often highest point in neighborhood)
- Bridges (visible from distance, natural crossing points)
- Parks (green space, often at intersections)
- Major intersections (named on signs, busy areas)

**How to execute:**
1. Identify landmark 0.5-1 mile ahead (visible from current position)
2. Walk toward landmark (straight line when possible)
3. Upon reaching landmark, identify NEXT landmark (0.5-1 mile ahead)
4. Repeat until destination

**Advantages:**
- Always have visual target (prevents wandering)
- Easy course correction (if you see landmark, you're on track)

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires good visibility (fog, night, smoke = difficult)
- Landmarks may be blocked (buildings, terrain)

### Dead Reckoning

**Strategy:** Walk in known direction for known distance (even without visual references).

**Process:**
1. Determine cardinal direction (sun, stars, street grid)
2. Walk in that direction (maintain heading)
3. Count paces or time (estimate distance)
4. Re-check direction every 0.25-0.5 miles (sun, shadows, landmarks)

**Example:**
- Need to go 2 miles NORTH
- Walk NORTH (using sun shadow = north)
- Count paces (200 paces = 100 meters, 2000 paces = 1 km, 4000 paces = 2 miles)
- Arrive at destination (or close enough to spot landmarks)

**Drift correction:**
- Humans naturally drift 15-20° off course (right-handed people drift right, left-handed drift left)
- Re-check heading every 10-15 minutes (use sun, shadows, landmarks)

### Backtracking Markers

**Strategy:** Leave markers to find your way back (if scavenging or exploring).

**Marker types:**
- Chalk or spray paint (arrows, X's on buildings)
- Broken branches, rocks (natural markers, subtle)
- Torn paper, cloth (tied to fence, pole)

**Standard trail marking:**
- Single arrow = direction of travel
- X = wrong way, do not follow
- Circle = destination or safe zone

**Security concern:**
- Obvious markers = others can track you
- Use only if returning to base is critical
- Erase or remove markers on return trip (prevent tracking)

## Navigation Hazards & Adaptations

### Blocked Routes (Debris, Fire, Riots)

**Decision tree:**
1. Can you see past the obstruction? (Is it short-term or long-term?)
2. Can you go around (1-2 blocks detour, maintain direction)?
3. If not, use Alternate Route #1 (planned in advance)
4. If also blocked, use Alternate Route #2
5. If all routes blocked, shelter in place (reassess after 1-2 hours)

**Detour rules:**
- Don't deviate >0.5 miles from primary route (risk getting lost)
- Return to primary route as soon as possible (familiar is safer)

### Poor Visibility (Smoke, Fog, Night)

**Night navigation:**
- Use stars (Polaris, Southern Cross)
- Minimize flashlight use (preserves battery, reduces visibility to others)
- Walk slower (1-1.5 mph, avoid trip hazards)
- Stick to major streets (easier footing, fewer obstacles)

**Smoke navigation:**
- Wet cloth over mouth/nose (filter particulates)
- Crawl if smoke thick (air clearer near ground)
- Avoid smoke source (detour upwind if possible)

**Fog navigation:**
- Use compass (if you have one)
- Follow building faces (hand on wall, navigate by touch)
- Listen for sounds (water = river/lake, traffic = highway, voices = people)

### Disorientation (Psychological)

**Symptoms:**
- Can't remember direction (feeling "turned around")
- Landmarks don't match memory (buildings look same)
- Anxiety, panic (elevated heart rate, confusion)

**Recovery techniques:**
1. **STOP:** Don't keep walking (you'll get more lost)
2. **Sit down:** 5-10 minutes rest (clears mind)
3. **Re-orient:** Use sun, shadows, street signs (determine cardinal direction)
4. **Landmarks:** Look for recognizable building, street sign (find your position)
5. **Backtrack:** If totally lost, return to last KNOWN location (even if 0.5-1 mile back)

**Prevention:**
- Mark your route (chalk, memory)
- Check map/landmarks every 10-15 minutes (don't drift too far off course)
- Tell someone your route (if traveling with group)

## Urban-Specific Navigation Features

### Street Sign Reading

**Intersections:**
- Two street signs = intersection (e.g., "5th Ave & Main St")
- Find both street names on your map (locate your position)

**Street numbers:**
- Odd numbers = one side of street
- Even numbers = other side of street
- Numbers increase in one direction (typically north or east)

**Missing signs:**
- Ask locals (if safe)
- Look at building numbers (interpolate street name)
- Use parallel street (one block over, check that sign)

### Building Numbers

**Address system (US cities):**
- 100 block = 1st major cross-street
- 200 block = 2nd major cross-street
- Example: 456 Main St = between 4th and 5th cross-streets

**How to use:**
1. Destination address: 1234 Oak St
2. You're at: 800 Oak St
3. Calculation: 1234 - 800 = 434 (4.34 blocks to go = ~0.4 miles)

**Not universal:**
- Older cities (pre-1900s) may have irregular numbering
- Small towns may skip numbers
- But generally reliable in grid-based cities

### River / Water Navigation

**Rivers flow downhill (to ocean, lake, or larger river):**
- Identify upstream vs downstream (observe flow direction)
- City center often near river mouth (historical trade/transport)

**Bridges as landmarks:**
- Named, visible, often at major intersections
- Can navigate "to the bridge" then cross and re-orient

**Waterfront reference:**
- If city is on coast, river, or lake: orient to water
- "North of the river" or "east of the lake" (cardinal reference)

### Highway / Freeway Navigation

**Freeways are cardinal-oriented:**
- North-South interstates = odd numbers (I-5, I-15, I-95)
- East-West interstates = even numbers (I-10, I-40, I-90)

**How to use:**
- Find freeway sign (I-10 East, I-5 South)
- Determine cardinal direction (I-10 East = heading East)
- Use to re-orient (if you need to go North, turn left off I-10 East)

**Don't walk on freeways:**
- Illegal (even in disasters, may be enforced)
- Dangerous (no shoulder, high-speed traffic if functional)
- No cover (exposed to threats)
- Walk parallel street instead (1-2 blocks away)

---

## Group Navigation

### Point Person System

**Roles:**
- **Navigator:** Reads map, tracks position (primary decision-maker)
- **Point:** Walks ahead (5-10 ft), watches for hazards, threats
- **Rear Guard:** Walks behind (5-10 ft), watches for followers, threats from behind
- **Civilians:** Walk in middle (protected position)

**Communication:**
- Hand signals (silent, tactical)
  - Fist up = STOP
  - Point = Direction
  - Tap head = Look/listen
- Whispered commands (if safe)
- No shouting (attracts attention)

### Pace & Rest Discipline

**Group walks as fast as slowest member:**
- Don't split group (separation = lost people)
- Take breaks every 60-90 minutes (5-10 min rest)
- Check in (headcount, injuries, water/food)

**If someone falls behind:**
- Rear guard alerts navigator
- Group slows or stops
- Assist struggling member (lighten load, shorter breaks)

---

## Navigation Tools & Improvisation

### Compass (If Available)

**Magnetic compass:**
- Red needle = NORTH
- Rotate bezel until "N" aligns with red needle
- Walk direction indicated by direction-of-travel arrow

**Smartphone compass:**
- Requires battery (conserve by turning off when not needed)
- Calibrate by waving in figure-8 pattern
- Less accurate than magnetic compass (magnetic interference from buildings)

### Map Reading

**Orient map to terrain:**
- Rotate map until north arrow points north (use compass or sun)
- Buildings, streets on map should align with what you see

**Triangulation (if you have map + landmarks):**
1. Identify 2-3 visible landmarks (buildings, towers, parks)
2. Find those landmarks on map
3. Draw imaginary lines from your position to each landmark
4. Where lines intersect on map = your position

### Improvised Tools

**Sun compass (no compass):**
- Shadow stick method (described earlier)
- Result: N-S-E-W markings on ground (walk according to these)

**Improvised map:**
- Paper + pencil/pen
- Sketch major streets, landmarks, intersections
- Mark north arrow (based on sun/stars)
- Update as you walk (add new landmarks)

## Navigation Training Exercises (Pre-Disaster)

### Exercise 1: Pace Count Calibration (20 minutes)

1. Find 100-meter or 100-yard course (track, football field)
2. Walk normally, count paces (left foot or every step)
3. Repeat 3 times (average the counts)
4. Record in notebook: "100 paces = 100 meters"
5. Practice in different conditions (with load, uphill, downhill)

### Exercise 2: No-GPS Walk (1-2 hours)

1. Choose destination 2-3 miles away
2. Leave phone/GPS at home (or turn off)
3. Bring paper map ONLY
4. Navigate using map, sun, street signs
5. Debrief: What was hard? What helped? How long did it take?

### Exercise 3: Landmark Memory (15 minutes daily)

1. Walk familiar route (home to work, store, etc.)
2. List 10 landmarks from memory (before walking)
3. Walk route, verify landmarks (did you remember correctly?)
4. Add 5 more landmarks (expand your mental map)
5. Repeat weekly (build comprehensive mental map)

### Exercise 4: Night Navigation (30-60 minutes)

1. Walk familiar area at night (low-crime, safe area)
2. Use only stars, street lights (no phone)
3. Navigate to 3 waypoints and return home
4. Builds comfort with low-visibility navigation

## Quick Reference Tables

### Walking Speed vs Distance

| Speed (mph) | 1 mile | 3 miles | 5 miles | 10 miles |
|-------------|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| 1.5 (heavy load) | 40 min | 2 hr | 3.3 hr | 6.7 hr |
| 2.0 (urban obstacles) | 30 min | 1.5 hr | 2.5 hr | 5 hr |
| 2.5 (normal walk) | 24 min | 1.2 hr | 2 hr | 4 hr |
| 3.0 (brisk walk) | 20 min | 1 hr | 1.7 hr | 3.3 hr |

**Multiply by 1.3-1.5x if:**
- Elderly, children, injured
- Night, low visibility
- Unfamiliar area (frequent stops to check map)

### Sun Position by Time (Northern Hemisphere, mid-latitudes)

| Time | Sun Position | Shadow Direction | Navigation Use |
|------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| 6-7 AM | East (low) | West | Sun rising, walk toward sun = East |
| 9-10 AM | Southeast | Northwest | Morning, sun on right = North |
| 12 Noon | South (high) | North (short) | Shadow points North |
| 2-3 PM | Southwest | Northeast | Afternoon, sun on left = North |
| 5-6 PM | West (low) | East | Sun setting, walk toward sun = West |

---

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Walking without checking direction | Re-check sun/shadow every 10-15 min |
| Following others (crowd mentality) | Navigate independently (crowds may be lost too) |
| Not marking route | Leave subtle markers (or memorize waypoints) |
| Ignoring fatigue (pushing too hard) | Rest every 60-90 min (prevents injury, disorientation) |
| Carrying too much weight | Lighten load (walk farther, faster, safer) |
| No alternate routes planned | Plan 2 alternates before departure |
| Forgetting to tell someone your route | Always inform someone (if traveling alone) |
| Walking at night without planning | Night walk = slower, more hazards (plan for 2x time) |

---

## When to Stop Navigating (Shelter in Place)

**Abort navigation if:**
- Injured (twisted ankle, cut, exhaustion)
- Weather turns severe (storm, extreme heat/cold)
- Route completely blocked (all 3 routes impassable)
- Night falls + no safe destination in sight (find shelter, wait for daylight)
- Threat level increases (gunfire, riots, following strangers)

**Find temporary shelter:**
- Abandoned building (check for safety first)
- Vehicle (lock doors, low visibility)
- Park or green space (if weather permits, away from streets)
- Wait 1-8 hours (reassess, rest, then continue or return home)
