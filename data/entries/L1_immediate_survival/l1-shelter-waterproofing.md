summary: Waterproofing shelters, containers, and clothing using natural materials found in the wild. Pine pitch is the most versatile sealant; birch bark is the best natural waterproof sheet; thatch layering
  sheds rain when properly angled.
warnings:
- Pine pitch is EXTREMELY flammable — never apply near open flame or use pitch-sealed items near fire
- Heating pine pitch produces toxic fumes — work in open air and don't inhale directly
- Birch bark removed from living trees can kill the tree — use fallen trees or take only small patches from large healthy trees
- Thatch roofs must maintain 45°+ angle to shed water — below 40°, water seeps through
steps:
- 'PINE PITCH SEALANT: collect hardened pine/spruce resin from wound sites on trees (amber-colored lumps). Melt in a container over low heat. Mix 3 parts melted resin + 1 part crushed charcoal + 1 part
  dry animal dung or plant fiber. This creates ''pitch glue'' — waterproof, strong, and gap-filling. Apply hot with a stick to seal seams, repair containers, waterproof joints.'
- 'BIRCH BARK: the gold standard of natural waterproofing. Peel large sheets from dead or fallen birch trees (the bark is waterproof even on dead trees for years). Layer bark sheets like shingles on shelter
  roofs — white side UP (this is the exterior waterproof layer). Overlap sheets by 6+ inches. Pin with wooden pegs or weight with poles.'
- 'THATCH ROOFING: bundle dried grass, reeds, or palm fronds into tight bundles 4-6 inches thick. Layer from bottom to top (like shingles), each row overlapping the one below by 2/3. Minimum 6-8 inches
  total thickness. At 45° pitch or steeper, a properly thatched roof sheds rain for 2-5 years.'
- 'CLAY DAUBING: mix clay soil + dried grass/straw + water to thick paste consistency. Apply 2-3 inch thick layer over woven stick walls (wattle-and-daub). Let dry completely (1-2 weeks). Apply a second
  coat. This creates a waterproof, insulating, wind-proof wall. Re-apply after heavy rain seasons.'
- 'BARK CONTAINER waterproofing: seal seams of bark containers (cups, bowls, storage boxes) with pitch glue. These hold water and can be used for hot-rock boiling.'
- 'LEATHER waterproofing: rub animal fat (tallow), beeswax, or pitch into leather. Work it in thoroughly by hand. This makes boots, bags, and clothing water-resistant for weeks. Reapply when water stops
  beading.'
- 'EMERGENCY PONCHO: large sheet of birch bark, folded and pinned with wooden pegs. Or layer large leaves (burdock, maple) on a string framework. Neither lasts long but provides temporary rain protection.'
- 'TESTING: pour water on the sealed surface. If it beads and runs off, the waterproofing is effective. If it soaks in within seconds, add another layer of sealant.'
