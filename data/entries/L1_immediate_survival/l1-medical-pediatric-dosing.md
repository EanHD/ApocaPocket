# Pediatric Medication Dosing - Weight-Based Reference

## Overview

**Children are not small adults - dosing by weight prevents overdose/underdose.** Adult doses can cause liver failure, seizures, or death in children. Under-dosing fails to treat pain or fever effectively.

**Critical principle:** Always dose by WEIGHT (kg or lbs), never by age alone. A 10-year-old can weigh 60 lbs or 120 lbs - same age, vastly different dose needs.

**This entry covers:** Over-the-counter medications safe for children when dosed correctly. Prescription medications require medical guidance.

## Weight Conversion (Quick Reference)

| Pounds (lbs) | Kilograms (kg) | Age Range (approximate) |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| 8-12 lbs | 3.6-5.4 kg | 0-3 months (newborn) |
| 12-16 lbs | 5.4-7.3 kg | 3-6 months |
| 16-20 lbs | 7.3-9.1 kg | 6-12 months |
| 20-24 lbs | 9.1-10.9 kg | 12-18 months |
| 24-30 lbs | 10.9-13.6 kg | 18-24 months (toddler) |
| 30-40 lbs | 13.6-18.1 kg | 2-4 years |
| 40-50 lbs | 18.1-22.7 kg | 4-6 years |
| 50-70 lbs | 22.7-31.8 kg | 6-9 years |
| 70-100 lbs | 31.8-45.4 kg | 9-12 years |
| 100+ lbs | 45.4+ kg | 12+ years (adult dosing) |

**To convert:**
- Pounds → Kilograms: Divide by 2.2 (e.g., 44 lbs ÷ 2.2 = 20 kg)
- Kilograms → Pounds: Multiply by 2.2 (e.g., 20 kg × 2.2 = 44 lbs)

**Ages are approximations only.** Always use actual weight.

## Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) - Dehydration

## Dosing Tools & Techniques

### Measuring Devices

**ALWAYS use:**
- Oral syringe (mL markings) ← MOST ACCURATE
- Medicine cup with mL markings
- Dropper with mL markings

**NEVER use:**
- Kitchen spoons (variable sizes)
- "Teaspoon" or "tablespoon" estimates (inaccurate)
- Dosing devices from different medications (can be different sizes)

### Administration Tips

**Infants (0-12 months):**
- Use oral syringe, aim toward inside of cheek (not throat - choking risk)
- Give slowly, let baby swallow between squirts
- Can mix with small amount of breast milk or formula (but give immediately - don't leave mixed)

**Toddlers (1-3 years):**
- Let them sit upright
- Use medicine cup or syringe
- Praise after taking medicine (positive reinforcement)
- Can follow with juice or water to mask taste

**Children (3+ years):**
- Explain why they need medicine ("helps tummy feel better")
- Let them hold cup/syringe if able
- Chewable tablets often easier than liquid

### What If Child Vomits After Dose?

| Time Since Dose | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| <15 minutes | Re-dose (assume nothing absorbed) |
| 15-30 minutes | Give 1/2 dose (partial absorption) |
| >30 minutes | Do not re-dose (assume full absorption) |

---

## When Medical Care is Needed

**Stop home treatment and seek medical care if:**
- Fever >104°F (40°C) in any child
- Fever in infant <3 months old (ANY fever is concerning)
- Fever lasting >3 days despite medication
- Child is difficult to wake up or very lethargic
- Rash with fever (could be serious infection)
- Dehydration signs (no urination 8+ hours, sunken eyes)
- Medication not reducing pain/fever within 1-2 hours
- Suspected overdose (gave too much)

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Dosing by age instead of weight | Always dose by weight (kg or lbs) |
| Using kitchen spoon | Use oral syringe or medicine cup with mL markings |
| Giving adult medications to children | Children's formulations only (<12 years) |
| Exceeding maximum daily doses | Track times and amounts carefully |
| Combining similar medications | Check labels (cold medicines often have acetaminophen or ibuprofen already) |
| Not giving ibuprofen with food | Always give with food or milk (stomach protection) |
| Giving aspirin to children | NEVER give aspirin <18 years (Reye's syndrome risk) |

---

## Medication Storage

### Temperature
- Room temperature: 68-77°F (20-25°C)
- Avoid heat (above stove, in car)
- Avoid freezing (garage in winter)

### Light
- Keep in original container (protects from light)
- Dark cabinet (not bathroom - humidity degrades medication)

### Expiration Dates
- **Follow strictly** (pediatric medications lose potency)
- Expired fever medicine may not reduce fever
- Expired antibiotics may not treat infection

### Child Safety
- High cabinet (not bathroom cabinet - kids can climb)
- Childproof caps (always re-lock)
- Never call medicine "candy" (confuses children)
