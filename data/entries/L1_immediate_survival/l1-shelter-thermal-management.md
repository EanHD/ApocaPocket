steps:
- Insulate from ground first — ground steals heat 25x faster than air.
- 'Layer clothing: wicking base, insulating middle, wind/waterproof outer.'
- Keep dry — wet insulation loses up to 90% of insulating value.
- Minimize shelter volume — smaller space retains body heat better.
- Huddle with others — shared body heat significantly increases warmth.
- Heat rocks near fire, wrap in cloth, place in shelter or sleeping bag (not hot enough
  to burn).
warnings:
- Cotton kills — wet cotton provides zero insulation and accelerates heat loss.
- Do not sleep directly on cold ground — hypothermia risk even in above-freezing temperatures.
- Tight clothing restricts circulation and reduces warmth — layers should be loose.

## Overview
Strategies for retaining body heat in cold conditions without external heat sources.

## Step-by-step
1. Insulate from ground first — ground steals heat 25x faster than air.
2. Layer clothing: wicking base, insulating middle, wind/waterproof outer.
3. Keep dry — wet insulation loses up to 90% of insulating value.
4. Minimize shelter volume — smaller space retains body heat better.
5. Huddle with others — shared body heat significantly increases warmth.
6. Heat rocks near fire, wrap in cloth, place in shelter or sleeping bag (not hot enough to burn).

## Warnings
- Cotton kills — wet cotton provides zero insulation and accelerates heat loss.
- Do not sleep directly on cold ground — hypothermia risk even in above-freezing temperatures.
- Tight clothing restricts circulation and reduces warmth — layers should be loose.
