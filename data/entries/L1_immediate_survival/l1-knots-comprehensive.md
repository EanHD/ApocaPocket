audit_status: verified
summary: A dozen knots cover 90 percent of needs. Bowline (fixed loop), clove hitch (attach to pole), taut-line hitch (adjustable loop), figure-8 (stopper knot), square knot (join ropes). Practice until
  you can tie in dark.
warnings:
- Wrong knot for application can fail catastrophically
- Some knots weaken rope (up to 50 percent strength loss)
- Wet knots are harder to untie - leave slack when possible
steps:
- 'BOWLINE: Fixed loop (does not slip). Climbing, rescue, securing loads. Rabbit comes out of hole, around tree, back in hole.'
- 'CLOVE HITCH: Attach rope to pole or tree. Quick, adjustable. Two wraps, second crosses over first.'
- 'TAUT-LINE HITCH: Adjustable loop. Tent guylines. Grips under load, slides when slack.'
- 'FIGURE-8: Stopper knot (prevents rope from sliding through hole). Climbing, securing end of rope.'
- 'SQUARE KNOT: Join two ropes of same diameter. Left over right, right over left. NOT for climbing (can slip under load).'
- 'SHEET BEND: Join two ropes of different diameters. Better than square knot for unequal ropes.'
- 'PRUSIK: Friction hitch slides up rope but grips under load. Climbing safety, hauling.'
- 'TRUCKER HITCH: Mechanical advantage for tightening loads. Creates 3:1 pulley. Securing cargo.'
