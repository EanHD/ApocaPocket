steps:
- Use any clean, non-toxic surface as catchment (tarp, plastic sheet, clean roof).
- Angle catchment surface to direct water into collection container.
- Let first few minutes of rain flush contaminants from surface before collecting.
- Use multiple containers to maximize collection during rain events.
- Filter collected water through cloth to remove debris.
- Treat collected water (boil or chemically disinfect) before drinking.
warnings:
- Rooftop runoff may contain bird droppings, chemicals, or heavy metals — always treat.
- Standing rainwater breeds mosquitoes — cover containers.
- First flush from any surface is the most contaminated — discard it.
