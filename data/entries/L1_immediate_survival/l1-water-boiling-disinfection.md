time_required: 10-20 minutes (including cooling time)
materials_needed:
- Heat source (fire, stove, camp stove)
- Metal pot or container (heat-safe)
- Pre-filter cloth or coffee filter (optional but recommended)
- Clean storage container with lid
- Method to measure time (watch or count)
summary: Boiling is the most reliable and universally effective method for killing all waterborne pathogens including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasites. Requires only heat and container. Effectiveness 99.99%+ against all biological threats. Does not remove chemicals or heavy metals.
warnings:
- Boiling does not remove heavy metals, industrial chemicals, pesticides, or salt — use filtration/distillation for chemical contamination
- Storage container hygiene is critical — recontamination after boiling is common failure point
- Hot water can cause severe burns — handle carefully and allow adequate cooling time before drinking
- Boiling reduces water volume through evaporation — plan for 10-15% loss
- Fuel requirements significant for large volumes — conserve fuel by using minimal water and insulated containers
- At high altitude (>5000 ft), boiling time must be extended due to lower boiling point
steps:
- 'PATHOGEN KILL TEMPERATURES: Understanding thermal death points is critical. Bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella, Cholera): 160°F (71°C) for 30 seconds. Viruses (Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Rotavirus): 185°F (85°C) for 1 minute. Protozoan cysts (Giardia, Cryptosporidium): 160°F (71°C) for 2-5 minutes. Parasitic eggs: 150°F (65°C) for several minutes. Boiling water reaches 212°F (100°C) at sea level — well above all pathogen kill temperatures.'
- 'ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENT: Water boiling point decreases ~1°F per 500 ft elevation gain. Sea level = 212°F. 5,000 ft = 203°F. 10,000 ft = 194°F. 14,000 ft = 187°F. While 185°F+ still kills pathogens, safety margin decreases. CDC/WHO altitude guidelines: <6,500 ft (2000m) = 1 minute rolling boil. 6,500-13,000 ft (2000-4000m) = 3 minutes rolling boil. >13,000 ft (4000m) = 5 minutes rolling boil.'
- 'PRE-FILTRATION (highly recommended): Turbid/cloudy water contains suspended sediment that can harbor pathogens and absorb heat, reducing disinfection effectiveness. Pre-filter methods: 1) CLOTH FILTER: pour through clean cotton cloth (t-shirt, bandana) 2-3 times. Removes 50-70% of sediment. 2) COFFEE FILTER: removes finer particles. 3) SETTLING: let water sit undisturbed 2-4 hours, carefully decant clear water from top without disturbing sediment. 4) COMBINATION: settle, then cloth filter for best clarity.'
- 'CONTAINER SELECTION: Use metal pot, steel canteen cup, aluminum mess kit, or any metal container. Avoid: plastic bottles (melts), thin glass (cracks), ceramic with cracks. Minimum capacity: 1 quart (1 liter) recommended. Wider opening = faster boil, more evaporation. Lid reduces evaporation and fuel use by 30-40%.'
- 'BOILING PROCEDURE: 1) Fill container 3/4 full (leave expansion room). 2) Place over heat source (fire, stove). 3) Watch for ROLLING BOIL — large bubbles continuously breaking surface across entire water surface, visible steam production, audible bubbling. Not just simmering (small bubbles on bottom). 4) Start timing once rolling boil achieved. 5) Maintain rolling boil for: 1 minute (sea level to 6,500 ft), 3 minutes (6,500-13,000 ft), 5 minutes (above 13,000 ft).'
- 'FUEL EFFICIENCY TIPS: Use lid (saves 30-40% fuel). Only boil volume needed. Pre-warm water in sun if possible. Use insulated cozy or wrap pot in clothing after boiling to retain heat. Multiple small batches more fuel-efficient than one large batch. Windscreen around fire/stove increases efficiency 40%.'
- 'COOLING SAFETY: Do NOT add unboiled water to speed cooling (recontamination risk). Let cool naturally 15-20 minutes to drinkable temperature (120-140°F). Or pour between clean containers 10-15 times (aeration) to cool faster and improve taste. Keep covered during cooling to prevent airborne contamination (dust, insects).'
- 'STORAGE: Transfer cooled water to clean container with tight-fitting lid. Pre-sanitize storage container by boiling it empty for 1 minute or rinsing with previously boiled water. Label with date/time. Consume within 24 hours if stored at room temp (bacteria can regrow in nutrient-rich water). Refrigerated boiled water lasts 3-4 days. Never dip dirty cup/hands into storage container — pour out portion instead.'
- 'TASTE IMPROVEMENT: Boiled water tastes flat due to dissolved gas loss. Improve by: 1) AERATION: pour between containers 15-20 times to reintroduce oxygen. 2) Add pinch of salt per quart. 3) Let sit exposed to air 1-2 hours before sealing. 4) Add clean fruit/herb for flavor if available.'
- 'EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVES (no pot): 1) ROCK BOILING: heat rocks in fire (avoid river rocks - explosive), drop into water-filled leather/bark container. 6-8 fist-sized rocks boil 1 quart. Replace rocks every 2-3 minutes. 2) BOTTLE BOILING: fill plastic bottle 3/4, suspend above fire (not touching flame), water inside prevents plastic from melting until water boils. 3) BAMBOO: use green bamboo section as water container, suspend over fire.'
- 'VOLUME PLANNING: Plan for evaporation loss 10-15% during boiling. For 1 liter finished water, start with 1.1-1.2 liters. Daily water needs: sedentary = 2-3 liters, active = 3-6 liters, hot climate = 6-10 liters. Fuel requirements (wood): ~1 lb hardwood to boil 1 quart from cold. ~0.5 lb to re-boil already hot water.'
- 'VERIFICATION: How to confirm water actually boiled: 1) Visual: saw large bubbles across entire surface. 2) Audible: heard continuous vigorous bubbling. 3) Steam: saw significant steam production. 4) Duration: maintained rolling boil for full required time. When in doubt, boil longer — no harm in extra time.'
- 'LIMITATIONS: Boiling kills pathogens but does NOT remove: heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic), chemical pollutants (pesticides, solvents), salt/salinity, bad taste from minerals, radioactive particles, microplastics. For chemical contamination, use activated carbon filtration or distillation in addition to boiling.'

# Boiling for Water Disinfection

Boiling is the most reliable and universally effective method for killing all waterborne pathogens including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasites. Requires only heat and container. Effectiveness 99.99%+ against all biological threats. Does not remove chemicals or heavy metals.

## Quick Reference

**Boiling Times:**
- Sea level to 6,500 ft: 1 minute rolling boil
- 6,500 ft to 13,000 ft: 3 minutes rolling boil
- Above 13,000 ft: 5 minutes rolling boil

**Pathogen Kill Temperatures:**
- Bacteria: 160°F (71°C) for 30 seconds
- Viruses: 185°F (85°C) for 1 minute
- Protozoa: 160°F (71°C) for 2-5 minutes
- Boiling: 212°F (100°C) at sea level (overkill = safety margin)

**Altitude Effects:**
| Elevation | Boiling Point | Time |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| Sea level | 212°F (100°C) | 1 min |
| 5,000 ft | 203°F (95°C) | 1 min |
| 10,000 ft | 194°F (90°C) | 3 min |
| 14,000 ft | 187°F (86°C) | 5 min |

## Fuel Requirements

**Wood (hardwood):**
- 1 quart water from cold: ~1 lb wood
- 1 gallon water from cold: ~4 lbs wood

**Fuel savings:**
- Use lid: saves 30-40%
- Windscreen: increases efficiency 40%
- Pre-warmed water: saves 20%

## Daily Volume Planning

**Water needs per person:**
- Sedentary/cool: 2-3 liters
- Moderate activity: 3-6 liters
- High activity/hot: 6-10 liters

**Evaporation loss:** 10-15% during boiling (plan accordingly)
