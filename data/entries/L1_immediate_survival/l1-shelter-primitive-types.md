summary: Emergency shelters from natural materials. Debris hut (insulated cocoon), lean-to (rain protection), A-frame (simple roof). Prioritize insulation and wind/rain protection. Takes 2-6 hours to build
  depending on type.
warnings:
- Inadequate insulation causes hypothermia even if shelter keeps rain off
- Build shelter BEFORE dark - takes longer than expected
- Site selection matters - avoid low spots (cold air pools), widow-makers (dead branches overhead)
steps:
- 'DEBRIS HUT: (1) Ridge pole 8-10 ft long, one end on ground, other on stump/fork 3 ft high. (2) Lean ribs (sticks) against both sides. (3) Pile leaves/grass/debris 2-3 ft thick over frame. (4) Crawl inside
  (tight fit - body heat warms space). Best insulation.'
- 'LEAN-TO: (1) Horizontal ridge pole between two trees, 4-5 ft high. (2) Lean poles against ridge at 45 degrees. (3) Cover with bark, branches, leaves. (4) Build fire in front (reflects heat). Rain protection,
  less insulation.'
- 'A-FRAME: (1) Ridge pole on two forked sticks. (2) Lean poles on both sides (like tent). (3) Cover with bark/branches/debris. (4) Enclosed on three sides. Moderate insulation and protection.'
