summary: Preventing carbon monoxide poisoning and fire hazards when using fire in
  shelters.
steps:
- Never burn fire in a sealed space — ensure ventilation opening at top and bottom
  of shelter.
- Place fire near entrance or under vent hole, not in center of sealed room.
- 'Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless — symptoms: headache, dizziness, confusion,
  death.'
- Use small, controlled fires — large fires consume oxygen rapidly in enclosed spaces.
- Keep combustible materials at least 3 feet from fire.
- Extinguish fire completely before sleeping in enclosed space — use heated rocks
  for warmth instead.
warnings:
- Carbon monoxide poisoning kills silently in sleep — ventilation is non-negotiable.
- Charcoal and briquettes produce extreme CO — never use indoors.
- Snow shelters with fire require ventilation holes kept clear at all times.
- If anyone feels dizzy or headachy near indoor fire, evacuate immediately.
