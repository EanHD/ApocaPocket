summary: Cold water (below 15C/60F) kills fast. The 1-10-1 rule - 1 minute of cold shock (gasping, panic), 10 minutes of meaningful movement (swim to safety), 1 hour until unconsciousness. Most cold-water drowning victims die in the first minute from panic and gasping, NOT hypothermia. Knowing this saves lives.
warnings:
- Cold water shock causes an involuntary gasp — if you go under during this, you aspirate water and drown immediately
- People can look completely fine (treading water, talking) then suddenly go unconscious from hypothermia
- Alcohol consumption before water exposure dramatically increases drowning risk
- Wet clothing accelerates heat loss — even after exiting water, hypothermia continues if you do not change clothes
steps:
- 'THE 1-10-1 RULE: MINUTE 1 — Cold shock: You gasp uncontrollably, hyperventilate, heart rate spikes. Panic. This is when most people drown. MINUTES 2-10 — Cold incapacitation: fingers go numb, swimming becomes uncoordinated, you lose fine motor skills. This is your window to self-rescue (swim to shore, grab flotation). MINUTES 10-60 — Hypothermia onset: core temperature drops, you become exhausted, mentally confused. After about 1 hour (varies by water temp and body size), you lose consciousness and drown.'
- 'IF YOU FALL INTO COLD WATER: (1) DO NOT PANIC (easier said than done). The gasping will pass in 60 seconds. (2) FLIP onto your back immediately, head above water. Get control of your breathing. (3) ASSESS: Can you touch bottom? Is there something to grab (boat, log, ice edge)? How far to shore? (4) If close to shore (under 10m): SWIM immediately while you still have dexterity. Strong, fast strokes. Do not try to remove clothing yet — swim first. (5) If far from shore: FLOAT and minimize movement (conserves heat and energy). Tuck into HELP position (Heat Escape Lessening Position): knees to chest, arms wrapped around legs. Wait for rescue. (6) Call for help if anyone can hear.'
- 'SWIM VS WAIT DECISION: SWIM if: shore is close (under 25m), no rescue coming, you are in current heading toward worse danger (waterfall, rapids). WAIT/FLOAT if: shore is far, rescue is coming, water is calm, you have flotation (PFD, pack, log). Swimming produces heat but also circulates cold water against skin — in very cold water (under 5C), swimming can hasten hypothermia.'
- 'GETTING OUT: (1) Exit water as fast as possible. (2) If ice: do not stand on edge (it breaks). Kick legs to get horizontal, spread arms wide, pull yourself onto ice like a seal. Once on ice, roll away from hole (distributes weight). (3) If shore: crawl out, move away from water edge.'
- 'IMMEDIATE POST-IMMERSION: (1) GET OUT OF WET CLOTHES immediately. Wring out if no dry clothes available. (2) Insulate (dry clothes, sleeping bag, emergency blanket, even leaves/moss). (3) Cover head (huge heat loss from head). (4) Gradual rewarming: body-to-body contact with another person (skin to skin in sleeping bag), warm fluids (NOT hot), gentle movement. NO hot bath (causes dangerous cardiac effects). (5) Treat for hypothermia (see entry).'
- 'RESCUE OF COLD-WATER VICTIM: (1) Get them out of water using reaching pole, throw rope, or boat — DO NOT enter water yourself (you become a second victim). (2) Handle gently (rough handling can trigger cardiac arrest in hypothermic patients). (3) Remove wet clothing. (4) Horizontal position (lying down — standing can cause blood pressure drop and collapse). (5) Insulate and rewarm. (6) CPR if no pulse (see CPR entry). Hypothermic victims can survive prolonged submersion — continue resuscitation until they are warm and still not responsive.'
- 'PREVENTION: (1) Wear a PFD (life jacket) near cold water — keeps you afloat during cold shock. (2) Do not drink alcohol before boating/water activities. (3) Learn to swim. (4) File a float plan (tell someone where you are going, when you will return). (5) Carry emergency kit (dry clothes in waterproof bag, fire-starting materials, emergency blanket). (6) Practice cold-shock breathing control: cold shower exposure (60 seconds under cold water) teaches your body to suppress the gasp reflex.'
- 'WATER TEMPERATURE SURVIVAL TIMES (rough estimates): 0C (32F, ice water): under 15 minutes. 5C (41F): 30-60 minutes. 10C (50F): 1-2 hours. 15C (60F): 2-4 hours. 20C (68F): 6-12 hours. These are for exhaustion/unconsciousness — death follows shortly after. Actual time depends on body size, clothing, activity level.'
