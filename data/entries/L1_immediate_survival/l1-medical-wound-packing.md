summary: Wound packing is the primary technique for controlling life-threatening bleeding from junctional wounds (groin, armpit, neck) and deep lacerations where tourniquets cannot be applied. Pack within
  3 minutes — blood loss kills fast.
warnings:
- This is for LIFE-THREATENING bleeding only — spurting blood, blood pooling on ground, or blood-soaked clothing
- Do not remove packing once placed — this dislodges forming clots and restarts hemorrhage
- Wound packing is extremely painful — warn the patient and do it anyway. Pain is survivable; blood loss is not
- 'Abdominal evisceration (organs visible): do NOT pack. Cover with moist clean cloth and evacuate.'
- If blood soaks through, pack MORE material on top — never remove the first layer
steps:
- Expose the wound completely — cut or tear away clothing. You must see the source of bleeding.
- If available, use hemostatic gauze (QuikClot, Celox). If not, use the cleanest cloth available — torn cotton shirts, gauze, sanitary pads, even a clean sock.
- Using your fingers, push packing material DIRECTLY into the wound cavity, pressing firmly against the bleeding source. Start at the deepest point of the wound.
- Continue feeding material into the wound in a zigzag pattern, maintaining firm pressure with your fingers as you pack. Fill the ENTIRE wound cavity tightly.
- A deep groin or armpit wound may require 3-5 feet of gauze or equivalent cloth strips. Keep packing until the wound is completely filled and firm.
- Once packed, apply direct pressure with both hands on top of the packing for a MINIMUM of 3 minutes (5+ minutes is better). Do not peek.
- After holding pressure, apply a pressure dressing over the packing — wrap tightly with elastic bandage, belt, or torn cloth strips. It should be tight enough to maintain pressure but not cut off circulation
  below.
- 'Monitor patient for shock: pale skin, rapid weak pulse, confusion, rapid breathing. Lay patient flat, elevate legs 12 inches if no spinal injury suspected.'
- Document time of packing — this information is critical for medical personnel who will eventually treat the wound.
