summary: Building signal fires for rescue visibility in day and night conditions.
steps:
- Build three fires in a triangle (international distress signal), spaced ~100 feet
  apart.
- Prepare fires in advance — have them ready to light quickly when aircraft/rescuers
  spotted.
- 'For daytime: add green branches, wet leaves, or rubber to create thick white smoke.'
- 'For nighttime: use dry wood for bright, visible flame.'
- Build on high, open ground with maximum visibility to sky and horizon.
- Maintain fuel supply to keep signals burning for extended period.
warnings:
- Signal fires can cause wildfires — clear area around fire to bare earth.
- Smoke from burning plastics/rubber is toxic — stand upwind.
- Do not signal until rescue is plausible — conserve resources.

## Overview
Building signal fires for rescue visibility in day and night conditions.

## Step-by-step
1. Build three fires in a triangle (international distress signal), spaced ~100 feet apart.
2. Prepare fires in advance — have them ready to light quickly when aircraft/rescuers spotted.
3. For daytime: add green branches, wet leaves, or rubber to create thick white smoke.
4. For nighttime: use dry wood for bright, visible flame.
5. Build on high, open ground with maximum visibility to sky and horizon.
6. Maintain fuel supply to keep signals burning for extended period.

## Warnings
- Signal fires can cause wildfires — clear area around fire to bare earth.
- Smoke from burning plastics/rubber is toxic — stand upwind.
- Do not signal until rescue is plausible — conserve resources.
