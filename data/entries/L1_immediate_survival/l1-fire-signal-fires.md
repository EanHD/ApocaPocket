audit_status: verified
difficulty: intermediate
time_required: 30-60 minutes (preparation), instant ignition (when needed)
materials_needed:
- Tinder and kindling (enough for 3 fires if using triangle pattern)
- Smoke materials (green branches, evergreen boughs, wet leaves, rubber, oil)
- Firewood (15-20 lbs per fire for 30 minutes burn time)
- Fire starter (matches, lighter, ferro rod)
- Clear ground (10 ft radius per fire, cleared to bare soil)
- Optional: signal mirror, whistle, bright colored cloth
summary: Signal fires are the most visible long-range rescue signal — visible up to 20 miles (aircraft) during day (smoke) and 5-10 miles at night (flame). Three fires in triangle = international distress signal. Smoke column needs to contrast with environment (white smoke vs dark forest, dark smoke vs snow).
warnings:
- Signal fires can cause wildfires — clear area around each fire to bare earth (10 ft radius minimum)
- Smoke from burning plastics/rubber/foam is toxic — stand upwind, use only when aircraft visible
- Do not light signal fires until rescue is plausible — conserves fuel and prevents false alarms
- In dry/fire-prone conditions (drought, high winds), prioritize safety over signaling
- Aircraft response time: 15-45 minutes typical — keep fires burning long enough
steps:
- 'PATTERN SELECTION: Three fires in TRIANGLE pattern (international distress signal SOS) — spacing 75-100 ft apart (25-30 paces), forms equilateral triangle. Visible from aircraft as distinct geometric pattern = intentional/distress (not random campfire). ALTERNATIVE: straight line of 3 fires (also recognized). SINGLE FIRE: acceptable if fuel/time limited, but less distinctive — must produce exceptional smoke/flame.'
- 'SITE SELECTION: HIGH GROUND — ridgetops, hilltops, clearings, meadows, beaches. Need clear view of SKY (aircraft approach) and HORIZON (ground rescuers). Avoid: dense forest canopy (smoke trapped below trees), narrow valleys (poor visibility), areas immediately adjacent to dense vegetation (fire spread risk). Clearings 50+ ft diameter ideal. Near water = safer.'
- 'PREPARATION PHASE: Build fires in advance as \"ready to light\" piles. Each fire needs: BASE LAYER: flat rocks or cleared dirt (prevents ground fire), TINDER BUNDLE: fist-sized, under log/lean-to protection, KINDLING: pencil to finger thickness, 2-3 lbs per fire, laid in teepee over tinder, FUEL WOOD: wrist-thick branches, 15-20 lbs per fire, stacked nearby ready to add. IGNITION METHOD: waterproofed matches/lighter stored AT each fire location in ziplock. COVER: tarp/bark shelter over each fire pile to keep dry.'
- 'SMOKE MATERIALS (DAYTIME): Store near each fire. WHITE SMOKE (visible against dark backgrounds): green/fresh evergreen boughs (spruce, pine, fir) — produces thick white smoke, fresh grass, wet leaves, damp rotten wood. BLACK SMOKE (visible against snow/bright backgrounds): motor oil (small amount poured on fire), rubber (tires, boot soles, foam), plastic (minimal — toxic). VOLUME: need continuous thick smoke column 20-30 ft high. Add smoke material every 2-3 minutes to maintain column.'
- 'FLAME FIRE (NIGHTTIME): Use DRY wood only. BEST FUEL: dead standing wood (dry), split wood (catches faster), birch bark, fatwood. BUILD TALL: tepee or log cabin structure 4-5 ft high creates tall visible flame. Add wood continuously to maintain bright flame. BRIGHTNESS: aim for flame visible 5+ miles. Reflection: build near water or snow for enhanced visibility (reflected light doubles apparent brightness).'
- 'IGNITION PROCEDURE: 1) SPOT AIRCRAFT/RESCUE — visual or auditory confirmation. 2) LIGHT CENTER FIRE FIRST using prepared tinder/kindling. 3) Once center fire established (2-3 minutes), light remaining two fires in triangle. 4) ADD SMOKE MATERIAL immediately (daytime) OR fuel wood for flame (nighttime). 5) MAINTAIN for 30-60 minutes minimum — aircraft may circle, return, or call additional rescue units.'
- 'SMOKE TECHNIQUE: Place green boughs ONTO established flame (not smothering). Creates immediate white smoke. Add handful every 2-3 minutes. If smoke dissipates too fast, add more boughs. Wind: 0-5 mph = vertical column (ideal), 5-15 mph = angled column (still visible), 15+ mph = smoke disperses (use night flame instead). Aim for smoke column reaching 50-100 ft height.'
- 'SIGNALING DISCIPLINE: THREE PULSES RULE — three of anything = distress in universal signaling: 3 fires, 3 whistle blasts, 3 mirror flashes, 3 gunshots. Wait 1 minute, repeat pattern. CONFIRMATION: if aircraft dips wings, circles, or flashes lights = signal received. Maintain fires until rescue arrives or aircraft clearly departs. Do NOT waste fuel on false alarms (bird shadows, distant planes at 30,000 ft).'
- 'FUEL CALCULATION: For 3-fire triangle burning 30 minutes each: Need 45-60 lbs dry firewood total (15-20 lbs per fire). Plus 6-9 lbs green boughs for smoke. Conservative approach: prepare 2× this amount. FUEL PRIORITY: stockpile near fires before emergency, not during. Daily task in survival camp: gather 20-30 lbs wood for signal fires.'
- 'BACKUP SIGNALS: While fires burning, use supplementary signals: SIGNAL MIRROR (glass/polished metal) aimed at aircraft — visible 10-15 miles. WHISTLE (three blasts) for ground rescuers. BRIGHT CLOTHING laid in X or SOS pattern on ground (10 ft letters). MOVEMENT: wave arms overhead (Y shape = yes/help needed).'
- 'FIRE SAFETY: Clear 10 ft radius around EACH fire to bare soil. Remove dead grass, leaves, dry branches. Dig shallow firepit (6" deep, 2-3 ft diameter). Have water/dirt nearby to extinguish if necessary. NEVER leave signal fires unattended once lit. Extinguish completely before leaving area (if rescue successful) or if weather becomes dangerous (high winds, approaching wildfire).'
- 'PRACTICE DRILL: Build one signal fire in safe conditions. Time yourself: preparation should take 15-20 minutes. Practice lighting tinder with wet hands/wind. Test smoke production with green boughs — learn how much material produces optimal column. Practice triangle layout with pacing (75-100 ft spacing). Pre-position materials at each site.'

# Signal Fire Construction — Day and Night Signaling

Signal fires are the most visible long-range rescue signal — visible up to 20 miles (aircraft) during day (smoke) and 5-10 miles at night (flame). Three fires in triangle = international distress signal. Smoke column needs to contrast with environment (white smoke vs dark forest, dark smoke vs snow).

## Quick Reference

**Visibility Range:**
- Smoke (daytime): 10-20 miles (aircraft altitude dependent)
- Flame (nighttime): 5-10 miles
- Signal mirror: 10-15 miles (supplementary)

**Pattern Recognition:**
- 3 fires in triangle: International distress (SOS)
- 3 fires in line: Also recognized distress signal
- 1 large fire: Acceptable but less distinctive

**Fuel Requirements (per fire, 30 min burn):**
- Tinder: fist-sized bundle
- Kindling: 2-3 lbs
- Fuel wood: 15-20 lbs dry
- Smoke material: 3-6 lbs green boughs (daytime)

**Triangle Spacing:** 75-100 ft between fires (25-30 paces)

## Smoke Production Guide

**White Smoke (dark backgrounds):**
- Fresh evergreen boughs (best)
- Green grass/leaves
- Wet/damp wood

**Black Smoke (snow/bright backgrounds):**
- Motor oil (small amounts)
- Rubber (toxic — last resort)
- Burning foam/plastic (toxic — emergency only)

**Technique:**
- Add material every 2-3 minutes
- Target: 50-100 ft smoke column
- Duration: Maintain 30-60 minutes minimum

## Site Selection Criteria

**Ideal locations:**
✓ Ridgetops/hilltops  
✓ Open clearings (50+ ft diameter)  
✓ Beaches/shorelines  
✓ Meadows/fields  
✓ Near water (safety)

**Avoid:**
✗ Dense forest canopy  
✗ Narrow valleys  
✗ Adjacent to dense brush  
✗ High wildfire risk areas

## Aircraft Response Signals

**Rescue confirmation (aircraft will):**
- Dip wings side-to-side
- Circle your position
- Flash landing lights
- Drop message/supplies

**Continue signaling until:** Rescue personnel arrive OR aircraft clearly departs (not just passing over)
