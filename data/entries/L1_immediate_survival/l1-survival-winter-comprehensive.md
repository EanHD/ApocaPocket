summary: Winter survival in temperate climates (0 to -20F). Hypothermia and frostbite are main threats. Layered clothing, insulated shelter, fire, dry socks. Water sources freeze - melt snow. Travel is
  exhausting in deep snow. Conserve energy.
warnings:
- Wet clothing causes rapid hypothermia even in mild cold (40F)
- Snow blindness (UV damage to eyes) causes temporary blindness - wear sunglasses or improvise eye protection
- Breaking through ice into water is often fatal - test ice thickness, avoid if possible
steps:
- 'CLOTHING LAYERS: Base wicking layer, insulation layer, windproof shell. Avoid cotton. Wool and synthetic retain warmth when wet. Hat, gloves, warm boots, extra socks.'
- 'SHELTER: Windproof and insulated. Snow provides excellent insulation (pile snow around tent or shelter walls). Small shelters warm faster with body heat.'
- 'FIRE: Essential. Gather dry wood (standing dead trees, inner bark). Build fire on platform (prevents melting into snow and extinguishing). Maintain fire constantly - restarting is hard.'
- 'WATER: Melt snow or ice near fire. Do not eat snow (cools body). Dehydration is common in winter (cold air is dry).'
- 'TRAVEL: Deep snow is exhausting. Use snowshoes or skis if available. Travel on ridges (less snow). Avoid avalanche terrain (see entry).'
- 'FROSTBITE: Watch for numb fingers, toes, nose, ears. Rewarm gradually (body heat, warm water). Do not rub (damages tissue).'
