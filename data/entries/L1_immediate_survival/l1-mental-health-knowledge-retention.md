# Knowledge Retention: Keeping What You Learn

## Why This Matters
**Knowledge without retention = wasted effort.** In survival scenarios, you can't Google things. What's in your head (and accessible) is what you have. Master retention = never lose hard-won knowledge.

## The Forgetting Curve

### The Science
Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885) discovered humans forget predictably:
- **24 hours:** 50% gone
- **48 hours:** 70% gone
- **1 week:** 90% gone (without reinforcement)

**Good news:** Each review dramatically slows the curve. After 4-5 reviews, information moves to long-term memory.

**Visual pattern:**
```
100% ────┐
         │     ╲
 50%     │       ╲──── (review here)
         │          ╲──── (review here)
  0%     └────────────╲──── (stable)
       Day1  Day3  Day7  Day30
```

### Practical Implications
- **Don't learn once:** Plan to review
- **Front-load reviews:** More frequent at first, then taper
- **Accept the curve:** It's biology, not failure
- **Review before forgetting:** Catch it at 70-80% recall

## Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS)

### The Science
**Timing is everything.** Review too soon = waste of time. Too late = already forgotten. Optimal spacing maximizes retention with minimum time.

### Implementation Methods

#### Paper Flashcards (Leitner System)
**Setup:** 5 boxes labeled Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 30, Mastered

**Process:**
1. New cards start in Box 1
2. Got it right? → Move to next box
3. Got it wrong? → Move back to Box 1
4. Review each box on its schedule

**Time investment:** 10-20 cards in 15 minutes
**Retention:** 85-95% long-term

#### Notebook Method
**Setup:** Create review schedule pages (Today, +3 Days, +7 Days, +30 Days)

**Process:**
1. When you learn something, note it on "Today"
2. After reviewing, move it to "+3 Days"
3. Continue moving forward if recalled correctly
4. Move back if forgotten

**Best for:** Text-heavy information, processes, procedures

#### Digital SRS (if available)
- **Anki:** Gold standard, customizable
- **Quizlet:** Simpler, good for basic facts
- **SuperMemo:** Original algorithm, complex interface

**Advantage:** Auto-scheduling, large capacity
**Disadvantage:** Requires device, battery, screen time

### What to Put in SRS

**High value:**
- Critical identification (plants, threats, landmarks)
- Procedures (medical protocols, radio codes)
- Facts (dosages, measurements, formulas)
- Languages (vocabulary, phrases)

**Low value:**
- Stuff you use daily (already reinforced)
- Easily referenced (if you have the book)
- Overly specific trivia (unlikely to need)

## Teaching Others

### The Science
**Teaching = forced retrieval + organization + simplification.** Engaging all three cements knowledge.

**The Protégé Effect:** When you're responsible for someone else's learning, you learn better. Your brain prioritizes it.

### Effective Teaching Methods

#### The Feynman Technique
1. **Choose concept:** Pick what you want to retain
2. **Teach to a child:** Explain in simple terms (no jargon)
3. **Identify gaps:** Where did you struggle to explain?
4. **Review and simplify:** Go back, learn the gaps, simplify further

**Time investment:** 20-30 minutes per concept
**Retention boost:** Teaching = 90% retention vs 50% reading

#### Study Buddy System
**Setup:** Partner with someone, alternate teaching

**Benefits:**
- Accountability (scheduled sessions)
- Different perspectives (fill each other's gaps)
- Social reinforcement (learning together = bonding)

**Format:** 15 min teach, 5 min questions, 15 min swap

#### Group Teaching
**Scenario:** Training multiple people simultaneously

**Structure:**
1. **Lecture:** You explain (5-10 min)
2. **Demo:** You show (5-10 min)
3. **Practice:** They do, you watch (20-30 min)
4. **Teach-back:** They teach someone else (15 min)

**Your retention:** Near 100% (taught + demonstrated + corrected)

## Practice Schedules

### The Science
**Consistency beats intensity.** 15 min/day > 2 hours/week.

**Why:** 
- Daily practice = daily memory consolidation
- Sleep between sessions = memory strengthening
- Low friction = sustainable long-term

### Daily Practice (15 min)
**Structure:**
- 5 min: Review yesterday's material
- 5 min: New material
- 5 min: Flash through old cards (spaced repetition)

**Best time:** Morning (fresh mind) or before bed (sleep consolidation)

**Cumulative:** 15 min/day × 365 = 91 hours/year = significant mastery

### Weekly Deep Dive (1-2 hours)
**Structure:**
- 30 min: Review entire week's material
- 30 min: Practice application (hands-on)
- 30 min: Identify weak spots and drill

**Purpose:** Catch what slipped through daily reviews

### Monthly Audit (2-3 hours)
**Structure:**
- Review all flashcards from the month
- Test yourself on real applications
- Update/remove outdated information
- Plan next month's learning goals

**Purpose:** Quality control, prevent drift

## Testing Mastery

### Three-Level Test

#### Level 1: Recognition
**Question:** Can you recognize it when you see it?
**Test:** Multiple choice, matching, yes/no
**Standard:** 90%+ correct

**Example:** "Is this plant edible?" (see photo)

#### Level 2: Recall
**Question:** Can you produce it from memory?
**Test:** Fill-in-blank, short answer, drawing
**Standard:** 80%+ correct

**Example:** "Describe the key features of this edible plant"

#### Level 3: Application
**Question:** Can you use it in the real world?
**Test:** Hands-on, under realistic conditions
**Standard:** Successful execution 3/3 times

**Example:** Identify and harvest the plant in the field

### Stress Testing
**The Ultimate Test:** Can you do it when it matters?

**Conditions:**
- Time pressure
- Fatigue
- Distraction
- High stakes
- Physical discomfort

**Why it matters:** Knowledge under stress = truly retained knowledge. Practice under pressure.

**Example scenarios:**
- Medical procedure with timer running
- Plant ID while hiking (tired, hungry)
- Radio protocol during simulated emergency

## Note-Taking for Retention

### The Science
**Writing = encoding.** The act of writing (especially by hand) engages brain regions that passive reading doesn't.

### Effective Methods

#### Cornell Method
**Layout:**
- **Left margin (2 inches):** Keywords, questions
- **Right (6 inches):** Notes, details
- **Bottom (2 inches):** Summary

**For review:** Cover the right side, quiz yourself using left margin prompts

#### Mind Mapping
**Structure:** Central concept, branches for categories, twigs for details

**Benefits:**
- Visual/spatial encoding
- Shows relationships
- Easier to remember structure

**Best for:** Complex interconnected topics

#### The Key Points Method
**Format:** After reading/learning, write down 3-5 key points from memory

**Why it works:** Forces active recall, identifies what actually stuck

**Time:** 5 minutes after each learning session

### Digital vs. Handwritten

**Handwritten advantages:**
- Deeper encoding (slower = more processing)
- Works without battery/screen
- Better for diagrams

**Digital advantages:**
- Searchable
- Easy to reorganize
- Infinite copies/backups

**Best practice:** Handwrite first pass, digitize important stuff later

## Cross-Training

### The Science
**Transfer learning:** Applying knowledge in multiple contexts strengthens neural pathways and makes it more flexible.

### Application Strategy

#### Context Variation
**Practice the same skill in different settings:**
- Fire-starting: Different weather, locations, materials
- Plant ID: Different seasons, lighting, growth stages
- First aid: Different injuries, patients, stress levels

**Result:** Skill becomes robust, not brittle

#### Skill Combination
**Use the knowledge in conjunction with other skills:**
- Navigation + plant ID = foraging while moving
- First aid + communication = coordinating rescue
- Tool making + planning = building with intention

**Result:** Knowledge integrates into larger skill web

#### Teaching Different Audiences
**Explain the same concept to different people:**
- Beginner: Simple, fundamental
- Intermediate: Nuanced, practical
- Expert: Edge cases, optimization

**Result:** Deep, flexible understanding

## Physical Practice

### The Science
**Motor skills = muscle memory.** Different neural pathways than declarative knowledge. Requires physical repetition.

### Deliberate Motor Practice

**Structure:**
1. **Slow motion:** Execute skill at 1/4 speed (build correct pattern)
2. **Full speed:** Execute at normal pace
3. **Variable conditions:** Execute under different circumstances
4. **Automaticity:** Execute while distracted (talking, etc.)

**Time to automaticity:** 
- Simple skill: 50-100 reps
- Complex skill: 500-1000 reps

**Examples:**
- Tying knots
- Fire starting
- Weapon handling
- First aid procedures

### Maintenance Practice
**Once learned, motor skills decay slower than facts, but they DO decay.**

**Schedule:**
- **Weekly:** Critical/complex skills
- **Monthly:** Moderate skills
- **Quarterly:** Simple/stable skills

**Maintenance dose:** 10-20 reps, focused on quality

## Review Cycles

### The Retention Hierarchy

```

└─ Critical current learning
└─ Flashcard review (spaced repetition queue)

WEEKLY (30-60 min)
└─ All daily items from this week
└─ Hands-on practice of key skills
└─ Weak spot identification

MONTHLY (2-3 hours)
