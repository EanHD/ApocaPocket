# Advanced Wound Closure - Suturing, Stapling, and Adhesives

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️

**This is an ADVANCED medical procedure requiring formal training and supervised practice.**

- **Legal:** Performing wound closure without proper credentials is illegal in most jurisdictions
- **Training required:** Practice on suture pads, pig's feet, supervised clinical hours, certification
- **Infection risk:** Closing contaminated wounds can trap bacteria, causing abscess or sepsis
- **Use only when:** Clean wound, medical care unavailable for 8+ hours, wound won't heal by secondary intention

**This entry is for:**
- Trained medical personnel in resource-limited settings
- Wilderness medicine scenarios (delayed evacuation >24 hours)
- Collapse scenarios where no formal medical care exists

**If medical care available within 6-8 hours, clean wound, apply pressure dressing, and transport instead.**

**NEVER close:**
- Puncture wounds (deep, narrow entry - trap infection)
- Animal/human bites (except face - high infection risk)
- Wounds >6-12 hours old (contaminated)
- Grossly contaminated wounds (dirt, feces, foreign material embedded)
- Infected wounds (pus, red streaking, fever)

---

## Overview

Wound closure restores anatomy, reduces infection risk, minimizes scarring, and promotes healing. **Primary closure** (suturing immediately) is preferred for clean, recent wounds. **Delayed primary closure** or **healing by secondary intention** may be safer for contaminated wounds.

**Methods of closure:**
1. **Sutures** - Most versatile, strongest, best for high-tension areas
2. **Staples** - Fast, effective for scalp/trunk, not for face
3. **Tissue adhesive (dermabond)** - No needles, quick, limited to low-tension areas
4. **Steri-strips** - Tape reinforcement, low-tension wounds only

---

## Wound Assessment

### Decision Tree: Can This Wound Be Closed?

**YES - Safe to close primarily (suture/staple/glue):**
- ✅ Clean wound (no dirt/debris/contamination)
- ✅ <6-12 hours old (varies by location - see table below)
- ✅ Edges can be approximated without excessive tension
- ✅ Good blood supply (not ischemic, pale, or cold)
- ✅ Not a puncture wound
- ✅ Not a bite (exception: facial bites may be closed with antibiotic coverage)

**NO - Use delayed closure or secondary healing:**
- ❌ Contaminated wound (soil, feces, rusty metal)
- ❌ >12-24 hours old (depends on location)
- ❌ Puncture wound (stab, gunshot - see gunshot entry)
- ❌ Animal/human bite (body/extremities)
- ❌ Signs of infection (pus, red streaking, fever, foul odor)
- ❌ Devitalized tissue (gray, black, or dead tissue visible)
- ❌ Patient cannot care for wound properly (homeless, unable to keep clean)

### "Golden Period" for Primary Closure

| Body Location | Maximum Time Since Injury | Reason |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Face/scalp | 24 hours | Excellent blood supply, low infection risk |
| Trunk | 12 hours | Moderate blood supply |
| Arms/legs | 6-12 hours | Variable blood supply |
| Hands/feet | 6-8 hours | Poor blood supply, high contamination risk |
| Contaminated wound (any location) | 6 hours maximum | High infection risk |

**After golden period:** Clean wound daily, allow to heal by secondary intention OR perform **delayed primary closure** 3-5 days later (once infection risk passed).

---

## Pre-Closure Preparation

### 1. Anesthesia (Pain Control)

**Local anesthetic options:**
- **Lidocaine 1%** (most common)
  - Onset: 2-5 minutes
  - Duration: 1-2 hours
  - Maximum dose: 4.5 mg/kg (plain) or 7 mg/kg (with epinephrine)
  - Example: 70kg adult = 315mg max (plain) = 31.5mL of 1% solution
- **Lidocaine with epinephrine** (1:100,000 or 1:200,000)
  - Epinephrine causes vasoconstriction (less bleeding, longer duration)
  - **NEVER use on fingers, toes, nose, ears, penis** (can cause tissue death from lack of blood flow)
  - Duration: 3-6 hours

**Injection technique:**
- Use 25-27 gauge needle (small, less painful)
- Inject slowly (fast injection = more pain)
- Inject through wound edge (not through intact skin if possible - less painful)
- Infiltrate entire wound margin (1cm on each side)
- Wait 5-10 minutes before starting
- **Test anesthesia:** Pinch wound with forceps - if patient feels it, wait longer or inject more

**Buffering lidocaine (reduces injection pain):**
- Add 1mL sodium bicarbonate to 10mL lidocaine
- Makes solution less acidic = less burning on injection

**Field alternatives (no lidocaine available):**
- Ice pack for 10-15 minutes (mild numbing)
- Oral pain medication 30-60 minutes before (ibuprofen, acetaminophen)
- Distraction (conversation, music)
- Proceed without anesthesia only if absolutely necessary

### 2. Wound Cleaning (CRITICAL STEP)

**Irrigation:**
- **Pressure:** 8-12 PSI (pounds per square inch) - forceful jet
  - Use 30-60mL syringe with 18-19 gauge needle/catheter
  - Or: Squeeze water bottle with small hole poked in cap
- **Volume:** Minimum 200-500mL (more for dirty wounds)
  - 1L+ for heavily contaminated wounds
- **Solution:** 
  - Sterile saline or clean tap water (equally effective)
  - NOT hydrogen peroxide or betadine inside wound (damages tissue)
- **Technique:**
  - Direct jet across wound at 45-degree angle (flushes debris out)
  - Irrigate all wound surfaces and depths
  - Continue until water runs clear

**Scrubbing:**
- Use sterile gauze or soft brush
- Scrub wound edges gently (removes dead cells, bacteria)
- Can use dilute antiseptic on wound edges (not deep in wound)

**Debridement:**
- Remove obviously dead tissue (gray, black, non-bleeding)
- Remove embedded foreign material (gravel, glass, wood)
- Trim severely ragged edges (create clean wound margin)
- Cut perpendicular to skin (straight edges approximate better)

### 3. Hemostasis (Stop Bleeding)

- Apply pressure with gauze for 5 minutes
- Identify specific bleeders (spurting vessels)
- Ligate (tie off) or cauterize large vessels if available
- Small oozing stops once sutures in place (tissue compression)
- Pat dry before starting closure

## Suture Materials

### Suture Types

| Type | Examples | Absorption | Tensile Strength | Best For |
|------|----------|------------|------------------|----------|
| **Absorbable (dissolve)** | Vicryl, Dexon, Monocryl | 60-90 days | Moderate, decreases over time | Deep layers, mucous membranes, areas hard to remove sutures (children, mouth) |
| **Non-absorbable** | Nylon, Prolene, Silk | Never (must remove) | High, maintains strength | Skin closure, high-tension areas |
| **Monofilament** (single strand) | Nylon, Prolene | Varies | Lower tissue drag, less infection risk | Face, hands, clean wounds |
| **Braided** (multiple strands twisted) | Silk, Vicryl | Varies | Easier to handle and tie | Deep tissues, gut closure |

**General recommendations:**
- **Face:** 5-0 or 6-0 nylon (thin = minimal scarring)
- **Scalp:** 3-0 or 4-0 nylon (thick = strong, hair hides scars)
- **Trunk/extremities:** 3-0 or 4-0 nylon
- **Hands/feet:** 4-0 or 5-0 nylon (thin, precise)
- **Deep layers:** 3-0 or 4-0 absorbable (Vicryl, Monocryl)
- **Mucous membranes (mouth, vagina):** 3-0 or 4-0 absorbable

**Suture size guide:**
- Lower number = thicker suture (0, 1-0, 2-0, 3-0...)
- Higher number = thinner suture (4-0, 5-0, 6-0...)
- Think of it as "zeros" - more zeros = thinner

### Needle Types

**Curved vs. Straight:**
- **Curved** (most common) - Easier to maneuver, better control
- **Straight** - Used for easily accessible wounds, rare

**Needle point types:**
- **Cutting** (triangular point) - Tough tissue (skin, fascia)
- **Reverse cutting** - Skin (preferred for most closures)
- **Tapered** (round point) - Delicate tissue (muscle, intestines, vessels)

**Needle size:**
- Match needle curve to wound depth
- Larger needle for deep wounds
- Smaller needle for face (precision, minimal trauma)

---

## Suturing Techniques

### Basic Instrument Handling

**Needle holder:**
- Grasp needle 2/3 back from point (optimal leverage)
- Lock handles (ratchet mechanism)
- Wrist rotation drives needle (not arm movement)

**Forceps (pickups):**
- Use toothed forceps for skin (better grip, less crushing)
- Handle like a pencil
- Grasp wound edge gently (too much pressure = tissue damage)

**Scissors:**
- Sharp scissors for cutting suture
- Cut close to knot (leaves 3-4mm tail)

### Universal Suture Principles

1. **Evert wound edges** (roll outward slightly)
   - Edges that touch heal better than inverted edges
   - Inverted edges = depressed scar
2. **Match dermis to dermis** (deep layer to deep layer)
   - Reduces tension on skin sutures
3. **Equal bites** (same depth/width on each side)
   - Prevents lopsided scars
4. **Appropriate spacing:**
   - Distance between sutures = width of suture from wound edge
   - Too close = ischemia (tissue death)
   - Too far = gaping, poor healing
5. **Minimal tension:**
   - Knots should just approximate edges (not strangle tissue)
   - "Just kiss the edges together"

### 1. Simple Interrupted Suture (Most Common)

**Best for:** Most wounds, versatile, if one breaks others hold

**Technique:**
1. Insert needle 3-5mm from wound edge at 90-degree angle
2. Drive needle through dermis and exit at bottom of wound
3. Cross to opposite side at same depth
4. Exit 3-5mm from opposite wound edge (mirror image)
5. Pull through, leaving 3-4cm tail
6. Tie square knot (see knot-tying below)
7. Cut suture leaving 3-4mm tails

**Spacing:** 5-10mm apart (varies by location, tension)

**Advantages:**
- Independent sutures (if one breaks, others hold)
- Easy to remove selectively
- Good for irregular wounds

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming for long wounds
- More sutures = more scarring potential

### 2. Vertical Mattress Suture (Best for Everting Edges)

**Best for:** Eversion needed, high-tension areas, thick skin (back, palms, soles)

**Technique:**
1. **Far-far bite (wide and deep):**
   - Insert needle 8-10mm from wound edge
   - Pass deep through dermis and subcutaneous tissue
   - Exit 8-10mm from opposite edge
2. **Reverse direction** - come back across wound
3. **Near-near bite (shallow and close):**
   - Re-insert 2-3mm from edge (same side as exit)
   - Pass shallow through dermis only
   - Exit 2-3mm from opposite edge (starting side)
4. Tie knot on starting side

**Spacing:** 8-12mm apart

**Advantages:**
- Excellent eversion (edges roll outward)
- Strong, handles tension well
- Fewer sutures needed than simple interrupted

**Disadvantages:**
- Visible crosshatch scars (remove early)
- More tissue damage than simple
- Takes longer than simple

### 3. Horizontal Mattress Suture (Best for High Tension)

**Best for:** Very high tension (back, over joints), fragile skin (elderly)

**Technique:**
1. Simple interrupted bite (enter 5mm from edge, cross wound, exit 5mm opposite side)
2. **Do NOT tie** - instead advance 5-10mm along wound
3. Re-insert on same side, cross back to starting side
4. Looks like railroad tracks
5. Tie both ends together on starting side

**Spacing:** 5-10mm between pairs

**Advantages:**
- Maximum tensile strength
- Distributes tension over larger area (good for fragile skin)
- Good hemostasis (compression)

**Disadvantages:**
- Worst scarring (remove early)
- Can cause ischemia if too tight (check circulation)
- Difficult to remove (interwoven)

### 4. Running (Continuous) Suture (Fastest)

**Best for:** Long, straight wounds, low-tension areas, scalp (hidden by hair)

**Technique:**
1. Start with simple interrupted stitch, tie knot but don't cut
2. Continue with serial simple stitches along wound
3. Do NOT tie after each stitch (suture remains continuous)
4. End: tie off to last loop or insert final stitch and tie

**Spacing:** 5-8mm apart

**Advantages:**
- Fast (50% faster than interrupted)
- Good for long wounds (scalp lacerations)
- Distributes tension evenly

**Disadvantages:**
- If breaks, entire closure fails
- Difficult to adjust tension
- Must remove entire suture at once

### 5. Subcuticular (Buried Intradermal) Suture (Best Cosmesis)

**Best for:** Face, cosmetic closure, children (no suture removal visit)

**Uses absorbable suture** (Monocryl, Vicryl)

**Technique:**
1. Enter at one end of wound at depth of dermis
2. Take small horizontal bites within dermis on alternating sides
3. Stay within dermal layer (do NOT exit skin surface until end)
4. Exit at opposite end
5. Tie both ends OR use buried knot at each end

**Spacing:** Small bites every 3-5mm

**Advantages:**
- Best cosmetic result (no suture marks)
- No removal needed (absorbable)
- Comfortable (no external sutures)

**Disadvantages:**
- Technically difficult (requires practice)
- Can't use for high-tension wounds
- Slower than other techniques

### 6. Deep (Buried) Sutures (Tension Reduction)

**When needed:** Wounds >5mm deep, high tension, prevent dead space

**Uses absorbable suture** (Vicryl, Monocryl 3-0 or 4-0)

**Technique:**
1. Tie knot at bottom of wound (inverted stitch)
   - Enter at base of wound on one side
   - Exit at surface of dermis (do not penetrate skin)
   - Cross wound
   - Enter at surface of dermis opposite side
   - Exit at base of wound
2. Tie knot - knot gets buried (won't poke out of skin)
3. Close deeper layer before superficial

**Purpose:**
- Reduces tension on skin sutures (better healing, less scarring)
- Closes dead space (prevents hematoma/seroma)
- Aligns tissue layers (muscle to muscle, fat to fat)

## Knot Tying

### Square Knot (Reef Knot) - Standard

**Technique:**
1. **First throw:** Right over left, pull through (creates half-knot)
2. **Second throw:** Left over right, pull through (completes square knot)
3. **Additional throws:** Alternate 2-4 more times (total 4-6 throws)

**Mnemonic:** "Right over left, left over right"

**Tension:** Pull firmly but don't strangle tissue - edges should just touch (0.5-1mm gap acceptable)

**Common mistake:** Granny knot (right over left TWICE) - slips easily, insecure

### Instrument Tie (One-Handed Tie)

**Fastest method, uses needle holder:**
1. Hold needle holder in dominant hand
2. Wrap suture around needle holder tip once (counterclockwise for righties)
3. Grasp short tail with needle holder
4. Pull through loop
5. Reverse direction, wrap clockwise
6. Grasp tail, pull through
7. Repeat 2-4 more times alternating direction

**Advantage:** Conserves suture (can use short tails), faster with practice

### Surgeon's Knot (Extra Secure)

**Use for:** Slippery suture (Prolene), high tension, bleeding vessel

**Technique:**
1. First throw: Loop TWICE before pulling through (double wrap)
2. Second throw: Single loop (standard)
3. Additional throws: Single loops

**Advantage:** First throw locks (won't slip while tying second throw)

---

## Staple Application

### When to Use Staples

**Best for:**
- Scalp lacerations (hair hides staples)
- Trunk (chest, abdomen, back)
- Extremities (arms, legs)
- Long, linear wounds
- Speed critical (mass casualty, multiple wounds)

**Do NOT use:**
- Face (cosmetic area)
- Hands/feet (painful, poor cosmesis)
- Over joints (movement dislodges)
- Thin, delicate skin

### Stapling Technique

**Equipment:** Skin stapler (disposable, pre-loaded)

**Technique:**
1. Evert wound edges with fingers or forceps
2. Place stapler perpendicular to wound
3. Center stapler over wound (equal distance from each edge)
4. Press firmly until stapler fires (click)
5. Release - staple remains in place
6. Space 5-10mm apart

**Advantages:**
- Very fast (seconds vs. minutes for sutures)
- Lower infection risk (less tissue trauma, no buried suture)
- Less painful than sutures (for insertion, not removal)

**Disadvantages:**
- Poorer cosmetic result (wider scars than sutures)
- Painful removal (can be traumatic for children)
- Requires staple remover tool
- Cannot use for complex wounds (curved, irregular)

**Removal:**
- 7-14 days depending on location (same as sutures)
- Use staple remover tool
- Squeeze handles to deform staple (M shape → W shape)
- Gentle upward pull - staple lifts out

---

## Tissue Adhesive (Dermabond, Liquid Stitches)

### When to Use Tissue Adhesive

**Best for:**
- Face (children especially - no removal visit)
- Clean, straight, low-tension wounds <5cm
- Edges approximate easily without gaping
- Pediatric patients (no needles, painless)

**Do NOT use:**
- High-tension areas (joints, back, scalp)
- Irregular or gaping wounds
- Contaminated wounds
- Moist areas (mucous membranes, groin)
- Over joints or high-movement areas
- Hands/feet (frequent washing)

### Application Technique

**Preparation:**
1. Clean and dry wound thoroughly (adhesive won't stick to wet skin)
2. Approximate edges manually (fingers or forceps)
3. Hold edges together (edges must touch)

**Application:**
1. Apply thin layer along wound (do NOT let drip into wound)
2. Apply 3-4 coats (wait 30 seconds between coats)
3. Hold edges together 30-60 seconds (until adhesive sets)
4. Adhesive dries forming protective barrier

**Curing time:** Fully polymerized in 2-3 minutes

**Duration:** Adhesive sloughs off naturally in 7-10 days (no removal needed)

**Advantages:**
- Painless (no needles)
- Fast (2-3 minutes start to finish)
- Waterproof (can shower immediately)
- No removal visit (saves resources)
- Good cosmetic results (no suture marks)

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive (compared to sutures)
- Cannot use for high-tension wounds (will dehisce)
- Requires dry wound (won't stick if bleeding/oozing)
- Shorter shelf life (2-3 years vs. 5+ for sutures)

**Field alternative:** Super glue (cyanoacrylate)
- Dermabond IS medical-grade cyanoacrylate
- Regular super glue (Krazy Glue, Loctite) works but:
  - More toxic (formaldehyde release)
  - More exothermic (heat generation - burns)
  - Less flexible (cracks easier)
- **Use ONLY if no other option** - medical grade much safer

---

## Wound Dressing

### Immediate Post-Closure Dressing

**Purpose:** Protect wound, absorb drainage, prevent contamination

**Layers:**
1. **Contact layer:** Non-adherent dressing (Adaptic, Xeroform) - prevents sticking
2. **Absorbent layer:** Gauze pads (4x4s) - absorbs blood/fluid
3. **Securing layer:** Tape or wrap (holds dressing in place)

**Special considerations:**
- Face: Minimal dressing (open to air after 24 hours)
- Scalp: Wrap entire head (protects sutures, controls bleeding)
- Extremities: Wrap circumferentially (not too tight - check circulation)
- Joints: Immobilize if possible (splint, sling) - prevents dehiscence

### Dressing Change Schedule

**First 24-48 hours:**
- Leave initial dressing in place (allows clot formation)
- Exception: Change if soaked through (bleeding) or signs of infection

**After 48 hours:**
- Remove dressing
- Clean with soap and water or saline
- Pat dry
- Apply antibiotic ointment (Bacitracin, Neosporin) - optional, prevents scabs
- Re-dress OR leave open to air (face, scalp)

**Frequency:** Daily cleaning, re-dress if still draining or high contamination risk

---

## Wound Care and Suture Removal

### Post-Closure Instructions

**First 24-48 hours:**
- Keep dry (no showers/baths)
- Elevate injured area (reduces swelling)
- Ice packs 20 minutes every 2 hours (reduces swelling, pain)
- Minimal movement (prevents dehiscence)

**After 48 hours:**
- Can shower (soap and water, pat dry)
- Apply antibiotic ointment daily
- Watch for infection signs

**Activity restrictions:**
- Avoid strenuous activity until sutures removed
- No swimming (chlorine, bacteria risk)
- Splint/immobilize if over joint

### Suture Removal Timing

| Location | Days Until Removal | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Face** | 3-5 days | Excellent blood supply, minimal tension, early removal prevents suture marks |
| **Scalp** | 7-10 days | Hidden by hair, can leave longer |
| **Trunk (chest, abdomen, back)** | 7-14 days | Moderate tension, slower healing |
| **Arms/legs** | 7-14 days | Moderate healing rate |
| **Joints (elbow, knee, ankle)** | 14 days | High tension, movement delays healing |
| **Hands/feet** | 10-14 days | High use, slower healing |
| **Mattress sutures (vertical/horizontal)** | 7 days maximum | Higher ischemia risk, remove early |

**Signs ready for removal:**
- Wound edges sealed (no gaps)
- No drainage
- No redness/swelling/warmth
- Gentle tug on skin doesn't separate edges

### Suture Removal Technique

**Equipment:** Suture removal scissors or scalpel blade, forceps, antiseptic

**Technique:**
1. Clean wound with antiseptic
2. Grasp knot with forceps, lift gently
3. Cut suture close to skin on ONE side (not both - can't remove)
4. Pull suture out by knot (pulls cleanly through skin)
5. Remove every other suture first (if remaining sutures hold, remove rest)
6. Clean wound again
7. Apply Steri-strips perpendicular to wound (reinforcement for 7 more days)

**If wound separates during removal:**
- Stop removing sutures
- Re-suture if gaping (or delayed closure)
- Means removed too early

---

## Tension Management

### Undermining (Advanced Technique)

**When needed:** High-tension wounds where edges don't approximate easily

**Technique:**
1. Insert scissors or scalpel horizontally under skin edge
2. Dissect plane between dermis and subcutaneous fat
3. Free 1-2cm of skin on each side
4. Allows skin to advance toward center with less tension

**Caution:** Risks bleeding, nerve damage - requires experience

### Relieving Incisions (Advanced)

**When needed:** Very large defects, edges won't meet even with undermining

**Technique:**
1. Make small perpendicular cuts at wound ends (releases tension)
2. Close main wound
3. Close relieving incisions secondarily or allow to heal by secondary intention

---

## Special Wounds

### Scalp Lacerations

**Challenges:** Heavy bleeding (many vessels), hair interferes

**Technique:**
- Control bleeding first (direct pressure, hemostats on vessel edges)
- Trim hair around wound (NOT shave - increases infection risk)
- Close in single layer (scalp is single thick layer)
- 3-0 or 4-0 nylon, simple interrupted or staples
- Space 5-10mm apart
- Can use horizontal mattress if severe bleeding (compress vessels)

**Removal:** 7-10 days

### Eyebrow Lacerations

**Critical rule:** DO NOT trim or shave eyebrow (may not grow back or grows unevenly)

**Technique:**
- Close carefully (eyebrow alignment critical for cosmesis)
- Use hair as landmarks (match hair direction on both sides)
- 5-0 or 6-0 nylon
- Remove in 3-5 days

### Lip Lacerations

**Critical:** Align vermillion border (red/pink lip line) perfectly - 1mm mismatch = visible for life

**Technique:**
1. Place first stitch at vermillion border (establishes alignment)
2. Close deep layer (orbicularis oris muscle) with 4-0 absorbable
3. Close skin with 5-0 or 6-0 nylon
4. Close mucosa (inside mouth) with 4-0 absorbable

**Removal:** 3-5 days (skin sutures), absorbable dissolves

### Tongue Lacerations

**Most do NOT require closure** (heals rapidly, difficult to keep sutures in place)

**Close if:**
- Gaping >5mm
- Bleeding won't stop with pressure
- Through-and-through (both sides)

**Technique:**
- 3-0 or 4-0 absorbable (chromic gut or Vicryl)
- Simple interrupted
- No removal needed (absorbable)

### Nail Bed Lacerations

**Important:** Fingernail must be removed to access nail bed

**Technique:**
1. Digital block (anesthesia)
2. Remove nail (soak in warm water, slide blunt instrument under nail)
3. Repair nail bed with 5-0 or 6-0 absorbable
4. Replace nail (acts as splint) OR place non-adherent dressing
5. Finger splint for 7-10 days

**Outcome:** Nail grows back in 3-6 months (may be irregular)

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Closing contaminated wound immediately | Clean thoroughly, consider delayed closure in 3-5 days |
| Tying sutures too tight (blanching skin) | Just approximate edges - skin should remain pink |
| Placing sutures too close together (<3mm) | Space 5-10mm apart (prevents ischemia) |
| Using absorbable suture on skin | Non-absorbable (nylon, Prolene) for skin (absorbable loses strength too fast) |
| Inverting wound edges (edges roll inward) | Evert edges (roll outward slightly) - heals better, less depression |
| Closing wounds under tension | Undermine or accept smaller closure (tension = dehiscence) |
| Removing all sutures at once | Remove every other suture first (test wound strength) |
| Not using deep sutures in deep wounds | Deep sutures reduce tension, close dead space |
| Suturing bites (body/extremities) | Bites have 50% infection rate - leave open, delayed closure, antibiotics |
| Shaving skin around wound | Trim long hair, don't shave (increases infection risk) |

---

## Complications

### Dehiscence (Wound Breakdown)

**Causes:**
- Excessive tension
- Infection
- Premature suture removal
- Patient activity (movement, lifting)
- Poor nutrition (low protein, vitamins)

**Management:**
- If early (<48 hours): Re-suture (surgical revision)
- If late (>48 hours): Leave open, allow secondary healing OR delayed closure
- Address underlying cause (infection → antibiotics, tension → undermining)

### Infection

**Signs:** Redness, warmth, swelling, pus, fever, red streaking

**Management:**
- Remove some/all sutures (allows drainage)
- Open wound, irrigate, pack with gauze
- Antibiotics (cephalexin, doxycycline - see antibiotic guide)
- Daily dressing changes
- Consider delayed closure once infection cleared (3-5 days)

**Prevention:**
- Thorough cleaning before closure
- Avoid closing contaminated wounds
- Avoid closing bites
- Follow golden period guidelines

### Hypertrophic Scar / Keloid

**Hypertrophic scar:** Raised, red, stays within wound boundary
**Keloid:** Raised, grows beyond wound boundary (worse than hypertrophic)

**Risk factors:**
- Genetic (darker skin tones, family history)
- Location (chest, shoulders, ears - high-tension areas)
- Infection or prolonged healing

**Prevention:**
- Minimize tension (deep sutures, early removal)
- Avoid infection
- Silicone gel sheets after healing (reduces scar formation)
- Massage scar daily (once healed)

**Treatment:** Steroid injections, laser therapy, surgical revision (requires medical care)

### Suture Abscess

**Cause:** Buried suture material triggers inflammatory response

**Signs:** Small, firm lump at old suture site, may drain pus

**Management:**
- Remove buried suture (open wound, find and extract suture)
- Antibiotics if cellulitis present
- Usually resolves once suture removed

---

## When to Seek Advanced Medical Care

**Immediate evacuation needed:**
- Signs of necrotizing fasciitis (gas gangrene): Rapid spreading redness, severe pain out of proportion, blistering, crepitus (crackling under skin), fever, shock
- Arterial bleeding not controlled
- Tendon, nerve, or bone visible in wound (requires surgical repair)
- Wound dehiscence with bowel or organs visible (abdominal wounds)

**Seek care when available:**
- Dehiscence (wound separation) >1cm
- Infection not improving with antibiotics in 48 hours
- Extensive scarring or poor cosmetic outcome (can be revised later)
- Suture abscess not resolving
- Concern for retained foreign body (glass, metal)
