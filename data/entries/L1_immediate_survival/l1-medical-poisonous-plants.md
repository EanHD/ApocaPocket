summary: Certain plants kill with tiny doses. Death camas, water hemlock, poison hemlock, deadly nightshade, and foxglove are the most dangerous. All edible plants have poisonous look-alikes. This entry
  covers recognition, symptoms, and emergency response.
warnings:
- Edibility testing (see separate entry) does NOT work for highly toxic plants — one bite can be fatal
- Children are more susceptible to plant poisoning due to lower body weight
- Skin contact with some plants (poison hemlock, giant hogweed) causes burns and blisters
- No true 'antidote' exists for most plant toxins — treatment is supportive
steps:
- 'WATER HEMLOCK (Cicuta): The most violently toxic plant in North America. Looks like: white umbrella-shaped flower clusters, parsnip-like root with chambers that ooze yellow oil when cut. Found near water.
  LETHAL DOSE: one bite of root. SYMPTOMS: within 15 minutes — vomiting, seizures, respiratory failure, death. NO TREATMENT in the field. Only hospital care (ventilator) saves victims. AVOIDANCE: never
  eat white-flowered umbrella plants (carrot family) unless you are 100% certain of ID.'
- 'POISON HEMLOCK (Conium): Killed Socrates. Looks like: tall (6-10 ft), white umbrella flowers, purple blotches on hollow stems, parsley-like leaves. Smells musty. LETHAL DOSE: a few leaves. SYMPTOMS:
  progressive paralysis starting with legs, then respiratory muscles. Death by suffocation while conscious. TREATMENT: none in field. Medical: ventilator support until toxin clears. AVOIDANCE: Learn carrot
  family plants — many are edible (wild carrot, parsley) but look-alikes kill.'
- 'DEATH CAMAS (Zigadenus): Looks like: grassy leaves, white/cream flowers in spike, onion-like bulb BUT no onion smell. Found in meadows. Often mistaken for wild onion. LETHAL DOSE: one bulb. SYMPTOMS:
  vomiting, low blood pressure, cardiac arrest. TREATMENT: none in field. AVOIDANCE: If it looks like onion but doesn''t smell like onion, DO NOT EAT.'
- 'DEADLY NIGHTSHADE (Atropa belladonna): Looks like: purple/green bell-shaped flowers, shiny black berries, bushy plant. Found in waste areas, forests. LETHAL DOSE: 10-20 berries (2-4 for children). SYMPTOMS:
  dilated pupils, dry mouth, hallucinations, confusion, seizures, coma. TREATMENT: induce vomiting if recent (<30 min), activated charcoal if available. Keep airway open. Cool body (toxin causes fever).
  AVOIDANCE: Teach children NEVER eat wild berries without adult approval.'
- 'FOXGLOVE (Digitalis): Source of heart medication digitalis, but toxic. Looks like: tall spike of tubular pink/purple flowers, fuzzy leaves. LETHAL DOSE: a few leaves. SYMPTOMS: nausea, visual disturbances
  (yellow halos), irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest. TREATMENT: none in field. AVOIDANCE: Beautiful but deadly. Don''t confuse with comfrey (similar leaves but no flower spike).'
- 'WHITE SNAKEROOT: Killed Abraham Lincoln''s mother (via milk from cows that ate it). Looks like: white fuzzy flower clusters, opposite leaves, 2-4 ft tall. SYMPTOMS: ''milk sickness'' — trembling, vomiting,
  death. Toxin passes through milk and meat. AVOIDANCE: Know what your livestock eat if you have animals.'
- 'GENERAL SYMPTOMS OF PLANT POISONING: Digestive (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), neurological (confusion, seizures, paralysis), cardiac (irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure), respiratory (difficulty
  breathing). TIME MATTERS — most plant toxins act quickly.'
- 'FIELD TREATMENT (no hospital): (1) If ingestion was <30 min ago AND patient is conscious, induce vomiting (finger down throat). DO NOT induce vomiting if: patient unconscious, convulsing, or ingested
  petroleum/acid. (2) Activated charcoal if available (20-50g in water). (3) Treat symptoms: seizure = protect from injury, respiratory distress = open airway. (4) Keep patient hydrated if they can swallow.
  (5) Monitor closely. (6) Evacuate to medical care if possible.'
- 'PREVENTION: (1) NEVER eat a plant unless you are 100% certain of identification. (2) Learn common toxic plants in your region. (3) Teach children: no eating wild plants without adult permission. (4)
  Use multiple field guides to confirm ID — one book is not enough. (5) If in doubt, DON''T.'
