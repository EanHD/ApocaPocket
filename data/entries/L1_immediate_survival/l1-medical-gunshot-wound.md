# Gunshot Wound Treatment - Assessment, Stabilization, and Field Management

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️

**Gunshot wounds are SURGICAL EMERGENCIES. Field treatment is temporary stabilization only.**

- **Main cause of death:** Internal bleeding (not visible externally)
- **Most gunshot wounds need surgery:** Even "minor" wounds can have internal organ damage
- **DO NOT remove bullets or embedded objects:** Removal can cause fatal hemorrhage
- **Time-critical:** "Golden hour" - survival decreases dramatically >60 minutes without surgical care
- **Scene safety FIRST:** Do not approach until scene is secure (active shooter, violence)

**This entry is for:**
- Tactical medical personnel (military, law enforcement)
- First responders in mass casualty events
- Wilderness scenarios with prolonged evacuation
- Collapse scenarios where surgical care unavailable

**IF SURGICAL CARE AVAILABLE:** Rapid transport ("scoop and run") to trauma center is priority. Minimize scene time.

**This guide covers field stabilization:** Hemorrhage control, assessment, monitoring, and evacuation priorities.

---

## Overview

Gunshot wounds (GSWs) are penetrating injuries caused by projectiles fired from firearms. Tissue damage results from:
1. **Direct tissue crushing** (projectile path)
2. **Cavitation** (temporary wound cavity from energy transfer - can be 10-20x bullet diameter)
3. **Fragmentation** (bone/bullet fragments become secondary projectiles)
4. **Shockwave** (pressure wave damages adjacent structures)

**Key principles:**
- **Hemorrhage control is priority #1** (massive bleeding kills in minutes)
- **Assume internal damage exceeds external appearance** (entry wound may be small but internal devastation massive)
- **All gunshot wounds penetrate body cavities need surgical exploration** (abdomen, chest, pelvis)
- **Rapid evacuation** to surgical capability is life-saving intervention

---

## Scene Safety and Approach (FIRST PRIORITY)

### Tactical Assessment

**BEFORE approaching victim:**
1. **Active threat?** Gunfire continuing? Shooter still present?
   - **YES:** Do NOT approach. Wait for law enforcement to secure scene.
   - **NO:** Proceed with caution.
2. **Secondary hazards?** Fire, structural collapse, chemical exposure?
3. **Multiple victims?** Triage (see mass casualty entry).

**Scene types:**
- **HOT zone:** Active threat (gunfire, violence) - NO medical care, focus on suppression/evacuation
- **WARM zone:** Threat neutralized but unsafe (indirect fire, unstable structure) - Minimal care (tourniquet, drag to safety)
- **COLD zone:** Secured scene - Full medical care

**Personal protection:**
- Body armor if available
- Cover and concealment
- Second responder (buddy system)
- Communication (radio, phone)

### Care Under Fire (Hot Zone)

**If taking fire:**
1. **Return fire / take cover** (can't help if you're shot)
2. **Encourage casualty to self-aid** (apply own tourniquet if able)
3. **Suppressive fire / smoke** to enable extraction
4. **Move casualty to cover** (drag, not carry - stay low)
5. **NO medical care until in cover** (exception: tourniquet if massive extremity bleeding visible)

**Care under fire = Minimal:**
- Tourniquet for life-threatening extremity hemorrhage (if can apply in <10 seconds)
- Drag to cover
- Return fire

---

## Wound Assessment

### Entry vs. Exit Wounds

**Entry wound characteristics:**
- Usually SMALLER than exit wound
- Round or oval shape
- Margins inverted (skin edges fold inward)
- Abrasion ring (reddish ring around wound from friction)
- Powder burns (if close range <2 feet)
- Stippling (gunpowder embedded in skin - <3 feet)

**Exit wound characteristics:**
- Usually LARGER than entry wound (energy dissipation, tissue tearing)
- Irregular, stellate (star-shaped), or slit-like
- Margins everted (skin edges fold outward)
- No powder burns or stippling
- More tissue damage visible

**Important:** Exit wound may not exist (bullet lodged inside body)

### Counting Wounds

**Critical:** Count ALL wounds (front, back, sides)
1. Completely undress patient (cut clothing away - don't miss wounds)
2. Log-roll to examine back (protect spine)
3. Count entry and exit wounds
4. **Even number = likely through-and-through**
5. **Odd number = bullet retained OR multiple bullets**

**Example interpretations:**
- 1 entry, 1 exit = Through-and-through (simple trajectory)
- 1 entry, 0 exit = Bullet retained (surgical removal needed)
- 2 entries, 1 exit = Two bullets, one retained (or one bullet, odd trajectory)
- Multiple wounds, unclear pairing = Assume worst (internal damage, multiple organ systems)

### Trajectory Assessment

**Determine bullet path:**
- Entry location → Exit location (draw imaginary line)
- What organs lie along path?
- Did bullet cross body midline? (indicates major vessel risk)
- Did bullet angle up or down?

**High-risk trajectories:**
- Crosses midline (aorta, vena cava, heart)
- Traverses multiple body cavities (chest → abdomen)
- Near major vessels (neck, groin, axilla)
- Head or neck (CNS, airway, major vessels)

---

## Hemorrhage Control (PRIORITY #1)

### External Bleeding Control

**Follow bleeding control protocol** (see severe bleeding entry):
1. **Direct pressure** (3-10 minutes, don't lift dressing)
2. **Wound packing** (for deep wounds, junctional areas)
3. **Tourniquet** (life-threatening extremity bleeding only)

### Wound Packing for Gunshot Wounds

**When to pack:**
- Deep wounds (>1 inch)
- Junctional areas (groin, axilla, neck) - where tourniquets can't be applied
- Bleeding not controlled by direct pressure alone

**Technique:**
1. **Hemostatic gauze preferred** (QuikClot Combat Gauze, Celox) - contains clotting agents
2. **Expose wound** (cut away clothing, irrigate debris if time permits)
3. **Identify bleeding source** (bright red = arterial, dark red = venous)
4. **Pack directly onto bleeder:**
   - Insert gauze into wound cavity
   - Pack TIGHTLY (firm pressure)
   - Fill entire wound depth
   - Use entire gauze roll if needed (don't be shy)
5. **Apply direct pressure OVER packing** (3 minutes minimum, 5-10 minutes ideal)
6. **Do NOT remove packing** to check (breaks clot)
7. **Apply pressure dressing** over packing (wrap firmly with elastic bandage)

**Packing tips:**
- Use forceps or gloved finger to push gauze deep into wound
- Layer gauze (accordion-style) - easier to remove later
- Mark "PACKED WOUND" on patient (so surgeons know)
- Write time of packing

### Tourniquet Use for Gunshot Wounds

**Indications (extremity GSWs):**
- Arterial bleeding (spurting blood)
- Bleeding not controlled by direct pressure
- Multiple casualties (tourniquet allows moving to next patient)
- Unsafe scene (need to move immediately)

**Application:** See severe bleeding entry for technique

**Special considerations:**
- Place tourniquet 2-3 inches ABOVE wound (not on wound)
- If wound is high on limb (near hip/shoulder), place tourniquet as high as possible
- Tighten until bleeding stops AND no pulse distal to tourniquet
- DO NOT loosen or remove in field

**Junctional hemorrhage (groin, axilla) - where tourniquets don't work:**
- Use wound packing (see above)
- Apply junctional tourniquet if available (SAM Junctional Tourniquet, Combat Ready Clamp)
- Direct manual pressure (continuous, firm)

---

## Body Region-Specific Management

### 1. Extremity Gunshot Wounds (Arms, Legs)

**Assessment:**
- Pulses distal to wound (radial pulse for arm, dorsalis pedis/posterior tibial for leg)
- Sensation (can patient feel touch below wound?)
- Motor function (can patient move fingers/toes?)
- Severe pain out of proportion (compartment syndrome - see below)

**Management:**
1. Control external bleeding (pressure, packing, tourniquet if needed)
2. Splint extremity (prevents further damage, reduces pain)
3. Mark "CSM" (circulation, sensation, motor) status on patient
4. Reassess pulses every 15 minutes

**Complications:**

**Vascular injury (artery/vein damage):**
- No pulse distal to wound = artery severed/damaged
- Expanding hematoma (swelling, firm, pulsating mass) = contained arterial rupture
- Pale, cold extremity = inadequate blood flow
- **Action:** Tourniquet (if not already applied), urgent surgical repair needed

**Nerve injury:**
- Loss of sensation or motor function below wound
- May be temporary (swelling, stretch) or permanent (transection)
- **Action:** Document deficit, protect limb, surgical evaluation

**Fracture:**
- Obvious deformity, instability, bone visible
- Gunshot + fracture = "open fracture" (high infection risk)
- **Action:** Splint in position found (don't straighten unless no pulse), antibiotics (see below), surgery needed

**Compartment syndrome:**
- Severe pain, worse with passive stretch
- Tight, swollen compartment (leg or forearm especially)
- Weak pulses, numbness, pale skin (late signs)
- Caused by bleeding into muscle compartment (fascia doesn't stretch → pressure builds → cuts off blood flow)
- **Action:** URGENT surgical fasciotomy needed (<6 hours to prevent permanent damage)

### 2. Chest Gunshot Wounds (Thorax)

**High mortality** (20-30% even with optimal care)

**Assessment:**
- Breathing: Rate, depth, effort, equal chest rise
- Breath sounds: Listen both sides (decreased = pneumothorax, hemothorax)
- Shock signs: Rapid pulse, low blood pressure, pale skin
- Sucking chest wound: Air hissing through wound with breathing
- Tracheal deviation: Trachea shifted to one side (tension pneumothorax)

**Life-threatening chest injuries (immediate treatment):**

**a) Sucking Chest Wound (Open Pneumothorax):**
- Chest wall defect allows air into chest cavity
- Lung collapses (can't expand)
- **Signs:** Hissing/sucking sound with breathing, blood bubbling from wound
- **Treatment:**
  1. **Occlusive dressing** (seals wound)
     - Commercial chest seal (Halo, Bolin, Asherman) preferred
     - Improvised: Plastic (bag, packaging), tape on 3 sides (flutter valve - lets air out but not in)
  2. Position patient sitting up or wounded side down (improves breathing)
  3. Monitor closely (can progress to tension pneumothorax)

**b) Tension Pneumothorax (Air Trapped in Chest):**
- Air enters chest with each breath but can't escape
- Pressure builds → collapses lung → shifts heart → obstructs blood return → shock → death
- **Signs:**
  - Severe respiratory distress (gasping, can't breathe)
  - Trachea deviated away from injured side
  - Distended neck veins (if not in shock)
  - Absent breath sounds on injured side
  - Hyperresonant (drum-like) sound on injured side
  - Shock (rapid pulse, low BP, confusion)
- **Treatment:** **NEEDLE DECOMPRESSION** (life-saving, do immediately if suspected)
  - Insert 14-16 gauge needle (3.25 inch length minimum) into 2nd intercostal space (between ribs 2 and 3), mid-clavicular line (nipple line), just above 3rd rib
  - Aim perpendicular to chest wall (straight in)
  - Rush of air = confirms tension pneumothorax
  - Leave catheter in place, tape securely
  - Patient should improve immediately (if not, may need second decompression or wrong diagnosis)
  - Needle decompression buys time - surgical chest tube still needed

**c) Massive Hemothorax (Blood in Chest):**
- Blood fills chest cavity (up to 1.5-2L can accumulate)
- **Signs:**
  - Shock (rapid pulse, low BP, pale, weak)
  - Decreased breath sounds on injured side
  - Dull sound on percussion (vs hyperresonant in pneumothorax)
- **Treatment:**
  - Position patient wounded side down (gravity drains blood away from good lung)
  - Large-bore IV x2 (fluid resuscitation - see IV entry)
  - Permissive hypotension (target systolic BP 80-90 mmHg - too much fluid increases bleeding)
  - Urgent surgery (chest tube, possible thoracotomy)

**d) Cardiac Tamponade (Blood Around Heart):**
- Blood accumulates in pericardial sac (around heart)
- Compresses heart → can't pump effectively → shock → death
- **Signs (Beck's triad):**
  - Muffled heart sounds (hard to hear)
  - Distended neck veins
  - Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- **Treatment:**
  - Urgent pericardiocentesis (needle into pericardial sac) - advanced skill, high risk
  - OR urgent thoracotomy (open chest surgery) - only option if cardiac arrest imminent
  - **Field treatment limited** - rapid evacuation is key

**General chest GSW management:**
1. Seal sucking wounds (occlusive dressing)
2. Position sitting or wounded side down (improves breathing)
3. High-flow oxygen (if available)
4. IV access (2 large-bore IVs)
5. Monitor for tension pneumothorax (needle decompression if develops)
6. Rapid evacuation to surgical capability

### 3. Abdominal Gunshot Wounds

**Assume intra-abdominal injury until proven otherwise** (90%+ need surgery)

**Assessment:**
- Entrance/exit wounds location
- Abdominal distension (blood accumulating)
- Peritoneal signs: Tenderness, guarding (patient tenses muscles), rigidity (board-like abdomen)
- Evisceration (organs protruding through wound)
- Blood in urine (kidney/bladder injury)
- Shock signs

**Management:**
1. **Do NOT explore wound** (finger, instrument) - causes more damage
2. **Do NOT push organs back in** if eviscerated
3. **If evisceration:**
   - Cover organs with moist sterile dressing (saline-soaked gauze)
   - Cover with occlusive dressing (plastic wrap or bag)
   - Do NOT let organs dry out (causes necrosis)
4. **NPO (nothing by mouth)** - patient will need surgery (anesthesia risk if stomach full)
5. **IV fluid resuscitation** (see below)
6. **Position patient supine with knees bent** (relaxes abdominal muscles, reduces pain)
7. **Antibiotics** (broad-spectrum - see antibiotic guide):
   - Ceftriaxone 1-2g IV + Metronidazole 500mg IV OR
   - Ciprofloxacin 400mg IV + Metronidazole 500mg IV
8. **Urgent surgical evacuation**

**Complications:**
- **Hemorrhage:** Liver, spleen, major vessels (aorta, vena cava, mesenteric)
- **Hollow viscus injury:** Stomach, intestine, colon (spills contents into abdomen → peritonitis → sepsis)
- **Urinary tract injury:** Kidney, bladder, ureter (blood in urine)
- **Diaphragm injury:** Chest and abdominal wounds communicate

### 4. Head and Neck Gunshot Wounds

**Highest mortality** (40-90% depending on location and trajectory)

#### **Head GSWs:**

**Cranial (skull/brain):**
- **Prognosis poor** if:
  - Unresponsive (GCS <8)
  - Bilateral pupil dilation (both pupils large, non-reactive)
  - Posturing (abnormal rigid posturing - decerebrate/decorticate)
- **If conscious and responsive:** Chance of survival exists
- **Management:**
  1. Control scalp bleeding (scalp bleeds heavily - direct pressure, wrap head)
  2. Position head elevated 30 degrees (reduces intracranial pressure)
  3. Do NOT pack brain tissue back into skull
  4. Cover wound with moist sterile dressing
  5. Monitor neurological status (GCS, pupils) every 5-15 minutes
  6. Avoid hypotension (low BP worsens brain injury - maintain SBP >90 mmHg)
  7. Urgent neurosurgical evacuation

**Facial GSWs:**
- Airway obstruction risk (blood, swelling, tissue)
- Massive bleeding (facial vessels rich)
- **Management:**
  1. Airway control: Suction blood, position patient sitting forward (blood drains out, not into airway)
  2. Control bleeding (direct pressure, packing)
  3. Consider nasopharyngeal airway (if no skull fracture) or surgical airway if needed
  4. High-flow oxygen
  5. Rapid evacuation

#### **Neck GSWs:**

**Highest risk structures:**
- Carotid/vertebral arteries (massive bleeding, stroke)
- Jugular veins (bleeding, air embolism risk)
- Trachea (airway compromise)
- Esophagus (infection risk)
- Spinal cord (paralysis)

**"Zones" of neck (surgical importance):**
- **Zone I** (below cricoid cartilage/collarbone): Hardest to access surgically
- **Zone II** (cricoid to angle of jaw): Easiest surgical access, most common
- **Zone III** (above angle of jaw): Difficult surgical access

**Management:**
1. **Direct pressure** on bleeding (manual pressure, NOT tourniquet on neck)
2. **Wound packing** if deep wound (junctional)
3. **Airway assessment:** Stridor (high-pitched breathing), hoarseness, subcutaneous emphysema (air under skin - crackles when pressed)
4. **If airway compromise:** Surgical airway (cricothyrotomy) may be needed
5. **Position patient supine** (if bleeding) or sitting (if airway compromise)
6. **Prevent air embolism:** Occlusive dressing if large venous injury (air sucked into vein can cause stroke/death)
7. **Spinal precautions** (collar, backboard) if trajectory suggests spinal involvement
8. **IV access** (opposite arm if wound is on one side of neck)
9. **Urgent surgical evacuation**

### 5. Pelvic/Groin Gunshot Wounds

**High mortality** (major vessels, large blood loss potential)

**Anatomy at risk:**
- Iliac arteries/veins (major vessels to legs)
- Bladder (blood in urine)
- Rectum (fecal contamination)
- Genitourinary structures

**Management:**
1. **External bleeding control:**
   - Direct pressure in groin (compress femoral artery against pelvis)
   - Wound packing (deep, tight)
   - Junctional tourniquet if available
2. **Pelvic stabilization** if pelvic fracture suspected (wrap sheet around pelvis tightly)
3. **IV resuscitation** (blood loss often massive)
4. **Antibiotics** (broad-spectrum, covers coliforms)
5. **NPO** (likely need surgery)
6. **Foley catheter** (if trained) - monitors urine output, assesses for bladder injury (blood in urine)
7. **Urgent surgical evacuation**

---

## Internal Bleeding Recognition

**Key concept:** External bleeding you can see and treat. Internal bleeding is silent killer.

### Signs of Internal Hemorrhage (Shock)

**Early shock (Class I-II, <30% blood loss):**
- Mild tachycardia (pulse 100-120 bpm)
- Mild anxiety, restlessness
- Normal blood pressure (body compensates)
- Skin slightly pale, cool

**Moderate shock (Class III, 30-40% blood loss):**
- Tachycardia (pulse 120-140 bpm)
- Low blood pressure (SBP 90-100 mmHg)
- Confusion, anxiety
- Pale, cool, clammy skin
- Rapid breathing (25-30 breaths/min)
- Weak pulse

**Severe shock (Class IV, >40% blood loss):**
- Severe tachycardia (pulse >140 bpm) OR bradycardia (pulse <60 - very ominous)
- Severe hypotension (SBP <70 mmHg)
- Altered mental status (confused, combative, or unresponsive)
- Cold, clammy, mottled skin
- Very rapid, shallow breathing
- Thready or absent pulses

**Action:**
- **IV access** (2 large-bore IVs)
- **Fluid resuscitation:** See below
- **Urgent evacuation** to surgical capability (only definitive treatment for internal bleeding)

---

## Fluid Resuscitation

### Permissive Hypotension Strategy

**Concept:** Too much IV fluid before hemorrhage controlled increases bleeding (raises blood pressure, dilutes clotting factors, dislodges clots)

**Target blood pressure:**
- **Conscious patient with radial pulse palpable:** No IV fluids (or minimal)
- **Unconscious OR no radial pulse:** IV fluids to restore radial pulse (SBP ~80-90 mmHg)
- **Head injury:** Maintain SBP >90 mmHg (hypotension worsens brain injury)

**Fluid resuscitation protocol:**
1. **Two large-bore IVs** (14-16 gauge) if possible
2. **Crystalloid:** Normal saline or Lactated Ringer's
3. **Bolus:** 500mL-1L rapidly (wide open, squeeze bag)
4. **Reassess:** Pulse, blood pressure, mental status
5. **If no improvement:** Repeat bolus (up to 2-3L total)
6. **If still in shock after 2-3L:** Assume massive ongoing hemorrhage, expedite evacuation (fluids alone won't save - needs surgery)

**Blood products preferred** (if available):
- Whole blood > PRBC (packed red blood cells)
- Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets (replace clotting factors)
- Tranexamic acid (TXA) 1g IV (reduces bleeding, give within 3 hours of injury)

---

## DO NOT Remove Embedded Objects

**Critical rule:** Impaled objects (bullets, fragments, shrapnel, debris) should **NOT** be removed in field.

**Why:**
- Object may be plugging hole in major vessel (removal = fatal hemorrhage)
- Object may be adjacent to critical structure (heart, brain, spinal cord) - movement = catastrophic injury
- Only surgical team with blood products, instruments, and capability to repair damage should remove objects

**Exceptions (may remove):**
- Object interferes with CPR (directly over chest compression site)
- Object interferes with airway management
- Object causes ongoing injury (moving, cutting)

**Management of embedded object:**
1. **Stabilize object in place:**
   - Bulky dressings around object (donut-shaped padding)
   - Tape to secure (prevent movement)
   - Do NOT cut object shorter (vibration from sawing = more damage)
2. **Control bleeding around object** (direct pressure, NOT on object)
3. **Splint if in extremity** (immobilize entire limb)
4. **Document object location** (photo if possible, detailed description)
5. **Transport with object in place**

---

## Antibiotics for Gunshot Wounds

**All gunshot wounds are contaminated** (clothing, skin bacteria, environmental debris driven into wound by bullet).

**Antibiotic administration:**
- **Start early** (ideally within 3 hours of injury - "golden period")
- **Broad-spectrum coverage** (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, anaerobes)

**Recommended regimens:**

**First-line (IV if available):**
- Ceftriaxone 1-2g IV once daily + Metronidazole 500mg IV every 8 hours

**Alternative:**
- Ciprofloxacin 400mg IV every 12 hours + Metronidazole 500mg IV every 8 hours

**If no IV access (oral):**
- Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 875mg/125mg PO twice daily
- OR Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO twice daily + Metronidazole 500mg PO three times daily

**Duration:** 24-48 hours (bridge to surgical care), or 5-7 days if definitive care unavailable

**Tetanus prophylaxis:**
- If last tetanus booster >10 years: Give tetanus shot (0.5mL IM)
- If last tetanus booster >5 years AND heavily contaminated wound: Give tetanus shot

---

## Pain Management

**Gunshot wounds are EXTREMELY painful.**

**Pain control ladder:**

**Mild-Moderate pain:**
- Ibuprofen 600-800mg PO every 6-8 hours (if not bleeding heavily)
- Acetaminophen 1000mg PO every 6 hours

**Moderate-Severe pain:**
- Tramadol 50-100mg PO every 4-6 hours
- Oral opioids: Oxycodone 5-10mg PO every 4-6 hours, Hydrocodone 5-10mg PO every 4-6 hours

**Severe pain:**
- Morphine 5-10mg IV/IM every 2-4 hours OR
- Fentanyl 50-100mcg IV/IM every 1-2 hours (faster onset, shorter duration)

**Ketamine** (advanced):
- 10-30mg IV slow push OR 50-100mg IM
- Provides analgesia + dissociation (patient awake but pain-free)
- Useful in prolonged field care

**Pain management principles:**
- Start with lowest effective dose
- Reassess every 15-30 minutes
- Titrate up if inadequate pain control
- Monitor for respiratory depression (opioids) - have naloxone available
- Document all doses given

---

## Positioning and Monitoring

### Patient Positioning

**General:**
- **Supine** (flat on back) - default for shock
- **Legs elevated 12 inches** (if shock, no head/chest/abdominal injury)
- **Sitting up** (if chest wound, respiratory distress, facial bleeding)
- **Wounded side down** (if massive hemothorax - drains blood away from good lung)
- **Recovery position** (if unconscious but breathing, no spinal injury)

**Spinal precautions:**
- If trajectory suggests spinal involvement OR patient has neuro deficits (weakness, numbness, paralysis)
- Cervical collar + backboard OR improvised (tape head to backboard, rolled towels on sides)

### Continuous Monitoring

**Every 15 minutes minimum (every 5 minutes if unstable):**
- [ ] **Pulse:** Rate, strength, regularity
- [ ] **Blood pressure:** If cuff available (SBP goal >90 mmHg)
- [ ] **Respiratory rate:** Breaths per minute (normal 12-20)
- [ ] **Mental status:** Alert, confused, or unresponsive (AVPU scale)
- [ ] **Skin:** Color (pink, pale, mottled), temperature (warm, cool, cold), moisture (dry, clammy)
- [ ] **Bleeding:** Check all dressings for saturation
- [ ] **Urine output:** Goal 30-50 mL/hr (if Foley catheter in place)

**Document all vital signs** (on patient or paper):
- Helps receiving hospital assess trend (improving vs declining)
- Legal documentation

### Deterioration Signs (Immediate Action Required)

- Decreased level of consciousness (confusion → unresponsiveness)
- Blood pressure dropping
- Pulse increasing (>120 bpm) or weak/thready
- Respiratory distress increasing
- Bleeding through dressings
- New symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal distension)

**Action:** Reassess ABC's (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), tighten hemorrhage control, increase IV fluids, expedite evacuation

---

## Evacuation Priorities

**All gunshot wounds require hospital evaluation** (even "minor" extremity wounds - internal damage invisible).

### Immediate Evacuation (Red/P1 - Life-Threatening)

- Uncontrolled hemorrhage
- Chest wounds (pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac injury)
- Abdominal wounds
- Head/neck wounds (especially if airway compromise or neurological deficits)
- Shock (signs of internal bleeding)
- Vascular injury (no pulse distal to wound)

**Goal:** <60 minutes to trauma center ("Golden Hour")

### Urgent Evacuation (Yellow/P2 - Can Wait 2-4 Hours)

- Stable extremity wounds (pulse intact, controlled bleeding)
- Superficial wounds (clearly no deep penetration)
- Stable vital signs

### Delayed Evacuation (Green/P3 - Can Wait Hours)

- Very minor wounds (tangential/grazing, minimal tissue injury)
- Stable vital signs, no pain

**Even "green" patients need eventual evaluation** (risk of delayed complications: infection, missed injuries).

---

## Special Scenarios

### Prolonged Field Care (No Evacuation Available)

**When evacuation delayed >24 hours OR indefinitely (collapse scenario):**

1. **Continue hemorrhage control** (pack wounds, pressure dressings)
2. **Antibiotics:** Broad-spectrum, continue until infection signs resolve (7-14 days)
3. **Wound care:**
   - Day 2-3: Remove packing if bleeding controlled, irrigate wound (see wound cleaning entry)
   - Delayed primary closure (3-5 days) OR allow to heal by secondary intention
   - Daily dressing changes
4. **Pain control:** Oral pain ladder (ibuprofen → tramadol → opioids)
5. **Fluid support:** Oral if conscious, IV if needed (maintain hydration)
6. **Monitor for complications:**
   - Infection (fever, pus, increasing redness)
   - Compartment syndrome (severe pain, tense swelling)
   - Abscess formation (localized swelling, pus)
7. **Nutrition:** High protein diet (promotes healing)

**Expected outcomes:**
- Extremity GSWs (if vascular/nerve intact): May heal without surgery (high infection risk)
- Chest GSWs: High mortality without chest tube/surgery
- Abdominal GSWs: Very high mortality without surgery (peritonitis → sepsis)
- Head GSWs: Depends on consciousness and neuro status (conscious = better prognosis)

### Mass Casualty

**Triage priorities:**
1. **Immediate (Red):** Treatable life-threatening injuries (hemorrhage controllable, airway manageable)
2. **Delayed (Yellow):** Serious but stable (can wait 2-4 hours)
3. **Minimal (Green):** Walking wounded
4. **Expectant (Black):** Injuries incompatible with survival given resources (massive head trauma, cardiac arrest after GSW)

**Triage mistakes in mass shooting:**
- Spending too long on one patient (treat and move on)
- Attempting CPR on cardiac arrest from GSW (futile - massive blood loss)
- Ignoring "walking wounded" (self-evacuate if possible)

**Tourniquet first, ask questions later:** In mass casualty, rapid tourniquet on all extremity GSWs with severe bleeding (frees you to move to next patient).

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Approaching hot zone (active gunfire) | Wait for scene to be secured before providing care |
| Removing embedded bullets/objects | Stabilize in place (removal in OR only) |
| Exploring wound with finger/instrument | Leave wound alone (causes more damage, bleeding) |
| Pushing eviscerated organs back into abdomen | Cover with moist dressing, do NOT push back in |
| Giving fluids to conscious patient with palpable pulse | Permissive hypotension (minimal fluids until surgery) |
| Attempting CPR on GSW cardiac arrest in field | Futile without blood products and surgery (use resources elsewhere) |
| Missing back wounds (not log-rolling patient) | Completely undress and examine ALL surfaces (front, back, sides) |
| Applying tourniquet to neck/groin | Direct pressure, wound packing, or junctional tourniquet (NOT standard tourniquet) |
| Delaying evacuation to "stabilize" | Scoop and run (rapid transport > prolonged scene time for penetrating trauma) |

## When Survival is Unlikely (Expectant Category)

**Injuries incompatible with survival in field setting:**
- Massive head trauma (unresponsive, bilateral dilated pupils, brain tissue exposed)
- Cardiac arrest from GSW (survival <1% even with optimal care)
- Multiple torso GSWs with shock unresponsive to resuscitation
- Exsanguination (blood loss so massive patient in extremis)

**In mass casualty:** These patients receive comfort care only (pain management, presence) while resources go to salvageable patients.

**In one-on-one scenario:** Continue resuscitation efforts until clear futility or resources exhausted.
