summary: 'Above 8,000 feet (2,400m), thin air causes altitude sickness (AMS). Symptoms: headache, nausea, fatigue. HACE (brain swelling) and HAPE (lung fluid) are life-threatening. The only cure is DESCENT.
  Prevent by ascending slowly (no more than 1,000 ft/day above 8,000 ft).'
warnings:
- Altitude sickness kills healthy, fit people — fitness does NOT protect
- HACE and HAPE can develop in hours — someone fine at noon can be dying by midnight
- The ONLY treatment for severe altitude sickness is DESCENT — no amount of rest at altitude will cure it
- Children may not report symptoms clearly — watch for behavioral changes (irritability, refusal to play)
steps:
- 'ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS (AMS — mild): SYMPTOMS: headache (throbbing, worse at night), nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, dizziness, difficulty sleeping. Starts 6-12 hours after ascending. TREATMENT:
  (1) STOP ascending (do not go higher until symptoms resolve). (2) Rest for 24-48 hours at current altitude. (3) Hydrate aggressively (drink until urine is clear). (4) Ibuprofen for headache. (5) Acetazolamide
  (Diamox) 125-250mg twice daily speeds acclimatization. (6) If symptoms worsen or don''t improve in 24 hours, DESCEND. PREVENTION: Ascend slowly (camp no more than 1,000 ft higher each night above 8,000
  ft).'
- 'HIGH ALTITUDE CEREBRAL EDEMA (HACE — severe, LIFE-THREATENING): SYMPTOMS: Severe headache, vomiting, confusion, ataxia (stumbling, loss of coordination — test with heel-to-toe walk), altered mental status,
  seizures, coma. TREATMENT: (1) DESCEND IMMEDIATELY — even 1,000 ft descent can be life-saving. (2) Dexamethasone 8mg, then 4mg every 6 hours (steroid reduces brain swelling). (3) Oxygen if available.
  (4) Evacuate to medical care. TIMELINE: Hours matter. HACE can progress to death in 12-24 hours without descent.'
- 'HIGH ALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA (HAPE — severe, LIFE-THREATENING): SYMPTOMS: Shortness of breath at rest (not just on exertion), dry cough progressing to wet cough with pink/frothy sputum, chest tightness,
  rapid heart rate, bluish lips/fingernails, fatigue out of proportion to exertion. TREATMENT: (1) DESCEND IMMEDIATELY. (2) Keep warm (cold worsens HAPE). (3) Minimize exertion (rest during descent — be
  carried if possible). (4) Nifedipine 30mg extended-release every 12 hours (reduces pulmonary artery pressure). (5) Oxygen if available. (6) Evacuate. TIMELINE: HAPE progresses rapidly — can be fatal in
  24 hours.'
- 'ATAXIA TEST (critical for distinguishing AMS from HACE): Have the person walk a straight line heel-to-toe (like a sobriety test). If they stumble, lose balance, or cannot complete the line, this indicates
  HACE. DESCEND immediately.'
- 'PREVENTION: (1) Ascend slowly. Ideal: 1,000 ft elevation gain per night above 8,000 ft. ''Climb high, sleep low'' — you can day-hike higher, but descend to sleep. (2) Hydrate aggressively (dehydration
  worsens symptoms). (3) Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (depress breathing). (4) Consider acetazolamide (Diamox) 125mg twice daily starting 24 hours before ascent — aids acclimatization. (5) Listen to
  your body — ego kills at altitude.'
- 'FIELD DIFFERENTIATION: AMS = headache + nausea, person can still walk/function normally. HACE = confusion + ataxia, person cannot walk straight line. HAPE = shortness of breath at rest, wet cough. If
  unsure, treat as HACE/HAPE and descend.'
- 'DESCENT PROTOCOL: Even 1,000-1,500 ft (300-500m) descent often reverses symptoms dramatically. If patient cannot walk, carry them down. Speed matters more than method. Once lower, continue to monitor
  — symptoms can recur if you re-ascend too soon.'
- 'LONG-TERM ACCLIMATIZATION: Takes 4-7 days to fully acclimatize to a new altitude. Some people never acclimatize to extreme altitude (>18,000 ft) — individual variation. Acclimatization is lost within
  1-2 weeks after descending.'

# Altitude Sickness — Recognition & Treatment

Above 8,000 feet (2,400m), thin air causes altitude sickness (AMS). Symptoms: headache, nausea, fatigue. HACE (brain swelling) and HAPE (lung fluid) are life-threatening. The only cure is DESCENT. Prevent by ascending slowly (no more than 1,000 ft/day above 8,000 ft).
