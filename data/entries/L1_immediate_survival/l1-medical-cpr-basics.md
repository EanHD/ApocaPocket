## Overview
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for sudden cardiac arrest. Immediate chest compressions are critical - brain damage begins within 4-6 minutes without oxygen. This protocol is for lay responders on adult victims (age 8+).

## Recognition
**Cardiac arrest signs:**
- Unresponsive (no response to shouting/shaking)
- Not breathing or only gasping
- No pulse (if trained to check)

## Step-by-Step Protocol

### 1. Scene Safety (5 seconds)
- Check for hazards (traffic, fire, electrical, violence)
- Ensure safe for you and victim
- If unsafe, do not approach

### 2. Check Responsiveness (5 seconds)
- Tap shoulders firmly, shout "Are you okay?"
- No response = call for help immediately

### 3. Activate Emergency Response (30 seconds)
- **Call 911** (or local emergency number) or send someone
- **Request AED** (automated external defibrillator) if available
- Put phone on speaker if alone

### 4. Position Victim
- Roll onto back on firm, flat surface
- Clear airway obstructions if visible

### 5. Begin Chest Compressions

**Hand Position:**
- Center of chest (lower half of sternum)
- Between nipples
- Heel of one hand, other hand on top
- Fingers interlaced, lift fingers off chest
- Shoulders directly over hands

**Compression Technique:**
- **Depth:** 2 inches (5 cm) minimum, 2.4 inches (6 cm) maximum
- **Rate:** 100-120 compressions per minute (almost 2 per second)
- **Recoil:** Allow full chest recoil between compressions
- **Minimize interruptions:** <10 seconds for any reason

**Count aloud:** "One, two, three, four..." to maintain rhythm

### 6. Rescue Breaths (if trained)
- After 30 compressions, give 2 breaths
- Tilt head back, lift chin
- Pinch nose closed
- Seal mouth over victim's mouth
- Breathe for 1 second, watch for chest rise
- **If untrained or uncomfortable:** Compression-only CPR is effective

### 7. Continue CPR Cycle
- **30 compressions : 2 breaths** (if giving breaths)
- **Continuous compressions** (if compression-only)
- Do not stop until:
  - AED arrives
  - Victim shows signs of life (breathing, movement)
  - Emergency responders take over
  - You are physically unable to continue

### 8. AED Use (when available)
- Turn on AED, follow voice prompts
- Expose chest, wipe dry if wet
- Attach pads as shown on pictures
- Stand clear for analysis
- Deliver shock if prompted
- Resume CPR immediately after shock

## Critical Measurements
- **Compression depth:** 2.0-2.4 inches (5-6 cm)
- **Compression rate:** 100-120/minute
- **Compression:breath ratio:** 30:2 (or continuous if no breaths)
- **Maximum interruption:** <10 seconds
- **AED shock delivery:** Within 3-5 minutes ideal

## Special Populations

### Children (1-8 years)
- Same hand position, less force
- Depth: 2 inches (5 cm) or 1/3 chest depth
- Can use one hand if child is small
- 30:2 ratio (single rescuer) or 15:2 (two rescuers)

### Infants (<1 year)
- Two fingers on center of chest (just below nipple line)
- Depth: 1.5 inches (4 cm) or 1/3 chest depth
- 30:2 ratio (single) or 15:2 (two rescuers)
- Cover infant's mouth AND nose with your mouth for breaths

### Pregnant Women
- Standard CPR technique
- If advanced pregnancy, manually displace uterus to left

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Compressions too shallow (<2 inches)
- ❌ Not allowing full chest recoil
- ❌ Compressions too slow (<100/min)
- ❌ Hands positioned too high (on neck) or too low (on abdomen)
- ❌ Long interruptions (>10 seconds)
- ❌ Stopping too soon - continue until help arrives

## Warnings
- **Rib fractures are common and acceptable** - effective CPR may break ribs, especially in elderly
- Compressions must be **hard and fast** - quality matters more than perfect technique
- **Do not stop** to check for pulse unless victim shows obvious signs of life
- **Fatigue is real** - switch with another rescuer every 2 minutes if possible
- For **drowning victims**, give 5 rescue breaths BEFORE starting compressions if trained

## When NOT to Start CPR
- Obvious signs of death (rigor mortis, decomposition)
- Valid Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order
- Scene is unsafe and cannot be made safe

## Post-Resuscitation
If victim regains pulse/breathing:
- Place in **recovery position** (on side)
- Monitor breathing continuously
- Keep warm, reassure
- Wait for EMS - do not leave alone
