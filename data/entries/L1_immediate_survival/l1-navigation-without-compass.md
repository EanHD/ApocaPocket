summary: Compass and GPS fail. Natural navigation uses sun, stars, moss, tree growth, wind patterns. Sun rises east, sets west. North Star (Polaris) marks true north. Southern Cross points south. Moss grows
  on north side of trees in northern hemisphere (usually).
warnings:
- Moss on trees is unreliable in dense forests or wet climates
- Cloud cover prevents sun/star navigation
- Natural navigation provides direction only - still need map or terrain knowledge
steps:
- 'SUN METHOD: Sun rises east, sets west. At noon, sun is due south (northern hemisphere) or due north (southern hemisphere). Shadow-stick method: Plant stick upright, mark shadow tip, wait 15 min, mark
  again. Line between marks runs east-west.'
- 'NORTH STAR (Polaris): Find Big Dipper, follow pointer stars to Polaris (bright star). Polaris marks true north. Northern hemisphere only.'
- 'SOUTHERN CROSS: Find Southern Cross constellation, extend long axis 4.5x its length - that point is south. Southern hemisphere only.'
- 'MOSS: Grows thicker on north side of trees (northern hemisphere) due to less sun. Unreliable - check multiple trees.'
- 'PREVAILING WINDS: Learn dominant wind direction for region. Wind-shaped trees lean away from prevailing wind.'
