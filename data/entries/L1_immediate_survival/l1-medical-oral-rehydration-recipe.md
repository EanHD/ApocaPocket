summary: The WHO Oral Rehydration Solution is the single most effective treatment for dehydration from diarrhea, vomiting, or heat illness. It has saved millions of lives. The exact recipe matters — wrong
  ratios can worsen dehydration.
warnings:
- Too much sugar pulls water INTO the gut and worsens diarrhea — measure carefully
- Too much salt can cause hypernatremia (seizures, brain damage) especially in children
- ORS does not treat the underlying cause — bloody diarrhea, persistent vomiting, or fever >39°C need additional treatment
- Use CLEAN water — ORS made with contaminated water adds infection to dehydration
- Discard unused solution after 24 hours — bacteria multiply rapidly in sugar-salt water
steps:
- 'WHO formula: 1 liter clean water + 6 level teaspoons sugar (30g) + ½ level teaspoon salt (2.5g). This is the EXACT ratio — do not estimate.'
- 'If no measuring spoons: use the ''pinch and scoop'' method — one fistful of sugar, one three-finger pinch of salt per liter.'
- Water must be boiled and cooled (or otherwise disinfected) before mixing. Mix until fully dissolved — no granules should remain.
- 'Taste test: solution should taste like tears (slightly salty). If saltier than tears, add more water. If sweet, add tiny pinch of salt.'
- 'Dosing for adults: 200-400ml after each loose stool, sipped slowly over 15-20 minutes. Do NOT gulp — this triggers vomiting.'
- 'Dosing for children: 50-100ml per kg body weight over 4 hours. A 10kg child needs 500-1000ml over 4 hours, given by teaspoon every 1-2 minutes.'
- If patient vomits, wait 10 minutes then resume with smaller, more frequent sips (1 teaspoon every 1-2 minutes).
- Continue ORS until diarrhea stops plus 24 hours. Minimum 3 liters/day for adults with active diarrhea.
- 'Enhanced version: add ½ cup orange juice or mashed banana for potassium if available. Zinc supplements (20mg/day) reduce diarrhea duration by 25% in children.'
- 'Signs ORS is working: urine output increases, mouth becomes moist, skin turgor improves (pinched skin snaps back quickly).'
