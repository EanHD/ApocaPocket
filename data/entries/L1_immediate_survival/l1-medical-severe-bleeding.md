## Overview
Life-threatening hemorrhage is a leading cause of preventable death. Rapid, effective bleeding control can save a life in minutes. This protocol covers external bleeding control for field/emergency situations.

## Recognition of Severe Bleeding
**Life-threatening bleeding:**
- Blood spurting from wound (arterial)
- Blood pooling rapidly on ground
- Clothing soaked with blood
- Blood loss >500mL (about 2 cups)

**Signs of shock from blood loss:**
- Pale, clammy skin
- Rapid, weak pulse (>100 bpm)
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Altered mental status, confusion
- Thirst

## Step-by-Step Protocol

### 1. Scene Safety & Protection (10 seconds)
- Wear gloves if available (prevent blood-borne pathogen exposure)
- If no gloves: use plastic bag, cloth barrier, or victim's own hand
- Ensure scene is safe

### 2. Expose the Wound (15 seconds)
- Cut or tear clothing to fully expose wound
- Remove debris if easily accessible
- Do NOT remove impaled objects

### 3. Apply Direct Pressure (Minimum 3 minutes)

**Technique:**
- Place clean cloth/gauze directly on wound
- Apply firm, continuous pressure with palm of hand
- Do NOT lift to check - maintain pressure for 3+ minutes minimum
- If blood soaks through: add more cloth on top, keep pressing

**Pressure amount:**
- Use significant force - you should feel tired
- Lean body weight into the wound
- Do NOT release pressure prematurely

**Duration:**
- Minor bleeding: 3-5 minutes
- Moderate bleeding: 5-10 minutes
- Severe bleeding: 10+ minutes or until EMS arrives

### 4. Pressure Points (if direct pressure insufficient)

Use pressure points while maintaining direct pressure on wound.

**Major arterial pressure points:**

| Location | Artery | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Neck (side) | Carotid | Head/scalp bleeding (use EXTREME caution) |
| Shoulder/armpit | Subclavian | Upper arm/shoulder |
| Inner upper arm | Brachial | Forearm/hand bleeding |
| Groin crease | Femoral | Thigh/leg bleeding |
| Behind knee | Popliteal | Lower leg bleeding |

**Technique:**
- Press artery against underlying bone
- Use 2-4 fingers or thumb
- Press hard enough to stop pulse beyond that point
- Maintain pressure until bleeding controlled

**Carotid pressure point WARNING:**
- Press only ONE side at a time (never both)
- Use only if other methods fail
- Can cause stroke if done incorrectly
- Maximum 10 minutes

### 5. Wound Packing (for deep/junctional wounds)

**When to pack:**
- Deep wounds (>1 inch deep)
- Junctional areas (groin, armpit, neck)
- Direct pressure alone insufficient
- Before or instead of tourniquet for junctional wounds

**Technique:**
- Use sterile gauze (hemostatic gauze preferred: QuikClot, Celox)
- Pack gauze deep into wound cavity
- Fill completely - use entire gauze roll if needed
- Pack tightly, but don't push so hard you cause more tissue damage
- Once packed, apply direct pressure on top for 3 minutes
- Secure with pressure dressing

**Hemostatic gauze:**
- Contains clotting agents (kaolin, chitosan)
- Apply directly to bleeding source
- Pack for 3 minutes of direct pressure
- More effective than plain gauze for severe bleeding

### 6. Tourniquet Application (LAST RESORT for extremity bleeding)

**When to apply:**
- Life-threatening extremity bleeding
- Direct pressure ineffective after 3 minutes
- Multiple casualties (tourniquet allows you to move to next victim)
- Unsafe environment (need to move immediately)

**When NOT to use:**
- Non-extremity wounds (head, neck, torso, groin)
- Minor bleeding
- Bleeding controlled by pressure

**Technique:**

1. **Position:** Place tourniquet 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) ABOVE wound
   - Not on a joint
   - As high on limb as possible if in doubt
   - On bare skin if possible (cut clothing)

2. **Apply band:**
   - Wrap tourniquet around limb
   - Thread band through buckle
   - Pull tight

3. **Tighten windlass:**
   - Twist windlass rod until bleeding stops
   - Twist until you cannot feel pulse beyond tourniquet
   - May require 4-8 turns
   - Don't stop turning until bleeding completely stops

4. **Secure:**
   - Lock windlass in place
   - Secure strap

5. **Mark time:**
   - Write "TQ" and time applied on tourniquet
   - Or write on victim's forehead/arm
   - Time critical for hospital handoff

6. **Do NOT remove:**
   - Once applied, only trained medical personnel should remove
   - Do NOT loosen to check
   - Removing tourniquet in field can cause fatal rebleeding

**Commercial tourniquets (preferred):**
- CAT (Combat Application Tourniquet)
- SOFT-T
- SAM XT

**Improvised tourniquet (if no commercial available):**
- Use: triangular bandage, belt, cloth strip (2+ inches wide)
- Never use: rope, wire, cable (too narrow - causes tissue damage)
- Need rigid windlass (stick, pen, rod) to twist
- Less effective than commercial - apply high on limb

**Tourniquet complications:**
- Nerve damage (rare if <2 hours)
- Limb loss (extremely rare if <6 hours)
- Pain (expected - do not remove for pain)

### 7. Pressure Dressing

Once bleeding slowed:
- Wrap elastic bandage or cravat over packed wound
- Firm, but not cutting off circulation
- Check pulse/sensation beyond dressing
- Elevate wounded limb above heart if no fracture

### 8. Monitor for Shock

- Lay victim flat
- Elevate legs 12 inches (if no head/chest/abdominal injury)
- Keep warm (prevent hypothermia)
- Nothing by mouth
- Reassure victim
- Monitor breathing, pulse every 5 minutes

## Special Situations

### Arterial vs. Venous Bleeding

**Arterial (severe):**
- Bright red blood
- Spurting with pulse
- Rapid blood loss
- Requires immediate tourniquet if pressure fails

**Venous (moderate):**
- Dark red blood
- Steady flow
- Slower blood loss
- Usually controlled with direct pressure

### Scalp Wounds
- Bleed heavily even when not serious (lots of blood vessels)
- Apply firm pressure
- Wrap entire head with bandage
- Do NOT apply pressure if skull fracture suspected (soft/depressed area)

### Amputated Limb
- Control bleeding at stump (tourniquet likely needed)
- Wrap amputated part in clean, dry cloth
- Place in plastic bag
- Keep cool (do NOT place on ice directly)
- Transport with victim

### Internal Bleeding
**Cannot be controlled in field - requires surgery**

Signs:
- Bruising, swelling, rigidity of abdomen/chest
- Coughing/vomiting blood
- Blood in stool/urine
- Signs of shock without external bleeding

Action:
- Lay victim flat
- Keep warm
- Expedite evacuation
- Monitor closely
- Nothing by mouth

## Critical Measurements
- **Tourniquet placement:** 2-3 inches above wound (minimum)
- **Direct pressure duration:** 3+ minutes minimum, 10+ for severe
- **Gauze packing:** Fill entire wound cavity (1-4 gauze rolls)
- **Tourniquet removal:** Only by trained medics, ideally <2 hours
- **Shock position:** Legs elevated 12 inches

## Common Mistakes
- ❌ Lifting dressing to "check if bleeding stopped" (breaks clot)
- ❌ Tourniquet placed directly on wound or on a joint
- ❌ Tourniquet not tight enough (causes more bleeding)
- ❌ Removing tourniquet in field
- ❌ Using narrow material (<1.5 inches) for improvised tourniquet
- ❌ Not packing wound deep enough
- ❌ Giving victim water/food (aspiration risk if surgery needed)

## Warnings
- **Tourniquets save lives** - do not hesitate if needed for life-threatening extremity bleeding
- **Massive bleeding kills in 3-5 minutes** - act immediately
- **Pressure must be maintained** - do not release prematurely
- **Gloves protect you** - blood can carry hepatitis, HIV, other diseases
- **Call for help early** - bleeding control is time-sensitive
- **Shock can be delayed** - monitor victim continuously
- **Do NOT elevate limb with suspected fracture** - can worsen injury
