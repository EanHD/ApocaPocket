# Documentation Methods: External Memory Systems

## Why This Matters
**Human memory is fallible. Groups need shared records. Write it down or lose it.**

In survival scenarios:
- Individual memory fails under stress/injury/age
- Knowledge must transfer across people and time
- Patterns emerge only with recorded data
- Mistakes are costly—documentation prevents repetition

**Core principle:** If it's worth knowing, it's worth recording.

## Writing Materials

### Primitive Materials (When Resources Are Scarce)

#### Charcoal on Bark
**How:** Burnt wood + smooth bark (birch best)
- **Pros:** Widely available, easy to produce, contrast
- **Cons:** Smudges easily, fades, fragile
- **Best for:** Temporary notes, sketches, maps
- **Lifespan:** Days to weeks

**Production:** 
1. Burn hardwood in low oxygen (smoldering, not flames)
2. Let cool, break into writing sticks
3. Harvest smooth bark (peel gently, don't kill tree)
4. Store charcoal dry

#### Scratching in Clay/Wax Tablets
**How:** Sharp tool + soft surface
- **Pros:** Reusable, durable, weatherproof
- **Cons:** Heavy, limited space, requires material prep
- **Best for:** Daily logs, temporary calculations
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite (clay can be fired for permanence)

**Production:**
1. Knead clay to remove air bubbles
2. Form into tablets (6"×4" practical size)
3. Let dry partially (leather-hard, still scratchable)
4. OR fill wooden frame with beeswax for reusable tablet

#### Ink on Paper/Fabric
**How:** Homemade ink + any writing surface
- **Pros:** Permanent, portable, detailed
- **Cons:** Requires ink production, paper degrades
- **Best for:** Long-term records, detailed diagrams
- **Lifespan:** Years to decades (if stored properly)

**Simple ink recipes:**
- **Oak gall ink:** Crushed oak galls + water + iron (nails in vinegar) = black ink
- **Soot ink:** Fine soot + water + tree sap = black ink
- **Berry ink:** Crushed dark berries + salt + vinegar = purple/red ink
- **Blood ink:** Animal blood + charcoal = brown ink (last resort)

**Writing tools:** 
- Sharpened feather quill
- Carved reed pen
- Brush from animal hair + stick

### Modern Materials (When Available)

#### Paper and Pencil
**Why superior:** Cheap, portable, no ink needed, erasable (pencil)
- **Waterproof upgrade:** Write in pencil, spray with fixative or store in plastic
- **Archive upgrade:** Use acid-free paper, store dark/cool/dry
- **Organization:** Three-ring binders (expandable, reorganizable)

#### Waterproof Notebooks
**Field standard:** Rite in the Rain or similar
- **Why:** Survives wet conditions, tears, rough handling
- **Cost:** Worth it for critical records
- **Best for:** Field logs, weather data, navigation notes

#### Digital Notes (With Backup Plan)
**If you have devices:**
- **Pros:** Searchable, infinite copies, compact
- **Cons:** Requires power, hardware can fail
- **Critical rule:** ALWAYS have physical backup of essential info

**Backup strategy:**
- Print critical documents quarterly
- Maintain handwritten field notes
- Multiple SD card copies
- Cloud backup if internet available

## Drawing: Visual Records

### Why Drawings Beat Text
- **Faster:** A map takes 1 minute, written directions take 10
- **Clearer:** Spatial relationships, proportions, patterns
- **Universal:** Cross language barriers
- **Memorable:** Visual memory is stronger than verbal

### What to Draw

#### Maps
**Purpose:** Navigation, resource locations, threat zones

**Essential elements:**
- North arrow (consistent orientation)
- Scale (paces, meters, miles)
- Landmarks (distinctive features)
- Resources (water, food, materials)
- Hazards (cliffs, swamps, hostile zones)
- Routes (safe paths, alternates)

**Update frequency:** After each exploration, note changes

#### Diagrams
**Purpose:** How things work, assembly instructions, repairs

**Examples:**
- Tool construction (step-by-step)
- Trap mechanisms (trigger, catch, reset)
- Plant anatomy (identify edible parts)
- Wound types (medical documentation)
- Knot tying (stage-by-stage)

**Key:** Label everything, show sequences with arrows/numbers

#### Plant/Animal Identification
**Purpose:** Recognition, classification, edibility

**Critical details:**
- Overall shape and size (include scale reference)
- Leaf arrangement and shape
- Flowers/seeds/fruit
- Bark/stem texture
- Habitat context

**Format:** Full-page per species, multiple views, seasonal variations

#### Construction Plans
**Purpose:** Building shelters, tools, infrastructure

**Include:**
- Measurements (precise, in units you can reproduce)
- Materials needed (quantities, sources)
- Assembly sequence (numbered steps)
- Load points (where stress concentrates)
- Modifications (what worked/didn't work)

**Update:** Annotate with lessons learned after building

## Photography (If Available)

### Critical Use Cases
- **Plant ID:** Far faster than drawing, captures fine detail
- **Faces:** People you encounter, for security and memory
- **Construction:** Document building stages (for teaching/repetition)
- **Damage:** Injuries, equipment failure (for analysis)
- **Evidence:** Events, encounters, discoveries

### Best Practices
**Metadata matters:** Date, time, location (GPS if available)

**Composition:**
- Overall shot (context)
- Medium shot (main subject)
- Close-up (critical details)
- Scale reference (coin, ruler, hand)

**Organization:**
- Folder by category (plants, people, construction, etc.)
- Filename with date: 2026-02-19-oak-tree.jpg
- Backup immediately (SD cards fail)

**Battery conservation:**
- Shoot in bursts (don't leave camera on)
- Lower resolution for non-critical shots
- Delete bad shots promptly

### When Camera Fails
**Always have backup:** Carry a small sketchbook. You can't trust electronics alone.

## Audio Recording (If Available)

### High-Value Use Cases

#### Oral History
**Why:** Stories, knowledge, culture preserved in speaker's own voice
- Elder knowledge (skills, local history, warnings)
- Event documentation (first-hand accounts)
- Language preservation (pronunciation, idioms)

**Format:** 
- Identify speaker, date, location at start
- Ask open-ended questions
- Let them speak naturally (don't interrupt)
- Summarize key points in writing afterward

#### Instructions and Procedures
**Why:** Exactly how something is done, in real-time
- "This is how you start a fire with these materials"
- "Here's what I'm seeing/hearing/smelling when this works"
- Running commentary during complex tasks

**Advantage:** Captures nuance that written steps miss

#### Debriefs
**After critical events:**
- Medical incidents (what worked, what didn't)
- Encounters (neutral description for later analysis)
- Expeditions (discoveries, conditions, lessons)

**Format:** Who, what, when, where, why, how, outcome, lessons

**Rule:** Record within 24 hours (memory degrades fast)

### Equipment Care
- **Protect from moisture:** Waterproof case or bag
- **Battery discipline:** Charge fully, power off between uses
- **Backup:** Copy files to multiple locations weekly
- **Transcribe key content:** Audio fails, write down the critical parts

## Symbols and Shorthand

### Why Develop Your Own System
- **Speed:** 3x faster than writing full words
- **Consistency:** Everyone uses same notation = no confusion
- **Efficiency:** Limited paper/space/time

### Common Symbol Sets

#### Navigation/Map Symbols
```
△ = Landmark (mountain, hill, structure)
~ = Water (stream, river, lake)
||||| = Forest/vegetation
::::: = Open ground/field
X = Danger/hazard
⊕ = Resource cache
→ = Direction/route
□ = Structure/shelter
○ = Settlement/camp
```

#### Status Indicators
```
✓ = Completed/verified
? = Unknown/uncertain
! = Important/urgent
⚠ = Warning/caution
☠ = Danger/hazard
+ = Medical/health
- = Negative/failed
```

#### Quantities and Measurements
```
# = Number/quantity
@ = At/location
~ = Approximately
> = More than
< = Less than
= = Equal to/is
→ = Leads to/results in
```

### Group Standardization
**Critical:** Everyone must use the same symbols

**Process:**
1. Agree on 20-30 core symbols
2. Post reference sheet in common area
3. Practice using them consistently
4. Update only by group consensus

## Weather Logs

### Why Track Weather
- **Patterns emerge:** Predict next week/month/season
- **Agriculture planning:** When to plant, harvest
- **Safety:** Anticipate storms, cold snaps, floods
- **Long-term:** Climate trends (is it changing?)

### Daily Weather Log Format

```
DATE: 2026-02-19
TIME: 0600 | 1200 | 1800

TEMP: 42°F | 58°F | 51°F
SKY: Cloudy | Partly | Overcast
WIND: Light N | Moderate W | Calm
PRECIP: None | Light rain (1800-1830)

NOTES: Front moved in around 1700, 
temp dropped 10° in 2 hours. 
Rain expected to continue overnight.
```

**Minimum frequency:** 2-3 times per day
**Time investment:** 2 minutes per entry

### Monthly Summary
**At month end, analyze:**
- Average high/low temps
- Total precipitation
- Dominant wind direction
- Storm frequency
- Compare to previous years

**Result:** Predictive calendar for next year

## Medical Records

### Why Document Health
- **Track treatments:** What worked, what didn't
- **Spot patterns:** Recurring issues, seasonal illness
- **Allergies:** Life-or-death information
- **Baseline:** Normal vitals for comparison when sick

### Individual Medical File

**Page 1: Core Info**
```
NAME: [Full name]
DOB: [Date of birth]
BLOOD TYPE: [A+/B-/etc.]
ALLERGIES: [Medications, foods, materials]
CHRONIC CONDITIONS: [Diabetes, asthma, etc.]
MEDICATIONS: [Daily meds, dosages]
```

**Page 2+: Medical Log**
```

ISSUE: Laceration, left forearm, 3" long
TREATMENT: Cleaned, 6 stitches, bandaged
PROVIDER: [Who treated]
OUTCOME: Healing well, stitches out 2026-02-22
NOTES: Cut on sheet metal while building
```

**Update:** After every injury, illness, treatment

### Vital Signs Baseline
**Record when healthy:**
- Resting heart rate (count for 60 seconds)
- Blood pressure (if equipment available)
- Respiration rate (breaths per minute)
- Temperature (normal baseline)

**Why:** When sick/injured, compare to baseline to assess severity

## Inventory Tracking

### Why Track Resources
- **Prevent waste:** Use oldest first (FIFO)
- **Spot shortages:** Before you run out
- **Plan procurement:** Know when to gather/hunt/trade
- **Prevent theft:** Notice if supplies disappear

### Inventory Log Format

```
ITEM: [Name]
LOCATION: [Where stored]
QUANTITY: [Amount + units]
ACQUIRED: [Date obtained]
EXPIRES: [If applicable]
SOURCE: [Where it came from]
NOTES: [Condition, etc.]

EXAMPLE:
ITEM: Rice, white
LOCATION: Pantry, Shelf 2
QUANTITY: 12 lbs
ACQUIRED: 2026-02-01
EXPIRES: 2028-02
SOURCE: Trade with Miller family
NOTES: In sealed bucket, dry
```

**Update frequency:** 
- Weekly: Check quantities
- Monthly: Full audit
- Immediately: When adding or consuming large amounts

### Expiration Management
**For each category:**
- Foods: Check monthly
- Medicines: Check quarterly
- Batteries: Check annually
- Seeds: Check before planting season

**System:** 
- Use oldest first (rotate stock)
- Mark expiring items clearly (colored tag)
- Consume within 3 months of expiration (safety margin)

## Construction Notes

### Why Document Building
- **Replicate success:** Build it again the same way
- **Avoid failure:** Don't repeat mistakes
- **Teach others:** Transfer knowledge
- **Maintenance:** Remember how it was built

### Construction Log Format

```
PROJECT: [Name of structure/item]
DATE STARTED: 2026-02-10
DATE COMPLETED: 2026-02-15

MATERIALS:
- 24x 8ft 2×4 lumber (pine)
- 100x 3" deck screws
- 1x 4'×8' plywood sheet
- etc.

MEASUREMENTS:
[Detailed dimensions, drawing attached]

TOOLS USED:
- Saw, hammer, drill, level, etc.

ASSEMBLY SEQUENCE:
1. Built frame (2×4 corners, screwed)
2. Added cross-braces for stability
3. Attached plywood top
4. etc.

WHAT WORKED:
- Pre-drilling screw holes prevented splitting
- Level was essential for stability

WHAT FAILED:
- First design too wobbly, added braces
- Ran short on screws, needed 120 not 100

TIME INVESTED: ~20 hours total

NEXT TIME:
- Order extra materials (10% buffer)
- Build frame on flat ground first
```

**Attach:** Photos or diagrams at each major stage

### Maintenance Schedule
**For each structure, note:**
- Inspection frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Known weak points (check first)
- Replacement parts (keep spares)
- Repairs done (log when, what, who)

## Bind and Preserve

### Organization Systems

#### Three-Ring Binder (If Available)
**Advantages:** 
- Add/remove/reorganize pages easily
- Dividers for categories
- Plastic sleeves protect important pages

**Structure:**
- Section 1: Core info (contacts, maps, protocols)
- Section 2: Daily logs (current year)
- Section 3: Reference (ID guides, instructions)
- Section 4: Long-term (yearly summaries, patterns)

#### Bound Notebook
**Advantages:**
- Durable, pages don't fall out
- Chronological record (can't rearrange)
- Portable

**Best for:** Field logs, daily journals, sequential records

**Index:** Reserve first 10 pages for table of contents (add as you go)

#### Loose-Leaf + Box
**Advantages:**
- Flexible, expandable
- Easy to make with scrap paper
- Can separate by topic into multiple boxes

**Protection:** Store in waterproof container, elevated off ground

### Preservation Best Practices

#### Protect from Water
- Waterproof container (plastic bin, ammo can, sealed bag)
- Keep elevated (off floor, away from leaks)
- Silica gel packets (absorb humidity)

#### Protect from Light
- UV fades ink and paper
- Store in dark location or opaque container
- Covered box better than open shelf

#### Protect from Pests
- Insects eat paper/glue
- Rodents shred for nesting
- Sealed container is essential
- Cedar chips deter (but don't rely on alone)

#### Protect from Handling
- High-traffic documents: laminate or plastic sleeve
- Make copies of critical pages
- Handle with clean, dry hands

#### Temperature and Humidity
- Cool and dry best (60-70°F, 30-40% humidity)
- Avoid attics (too hot) and basements (too damp)
- Consistent conditions better than fluctuating

### Backup Strategy
**Critical documents = multiple copies**

**3-2-1 Rule:**
- **3 copies** minimum
- **2 different formats** (digital + paper)
- **1 offsite** (different location)

**Example:**
- Original in binder at main location
- Copy in waterproof cache 500m away
- Digital scan on SD card in bug-out bag

## Application Scenarios

**Solo survival:**
- Daily journal (observations, decisions, lessons)
- Resource map (water, food, materials)
- Weather log (pattern prediction)
- Health log (track injuries, treatments)

**Small group:**
- Shared medical records (everyone's allergies, conditions)
- Inventory system (who's responsible, what we have)
- Duty roster (who does what, when)
- Meeting notes (decisions made, reasons why)

**Long-term community:**
- Comprehensive library (skills, reference, history)
- Legal records (agreements, disputes, resolutions)
- Census (who's here, skills, relationships)
- Economic records (production, trade, debts)

## Quick Reference Card

```
DOCUMENTATION PRIORITY:
1. Medical records (allergies, treatments)
2. Resource inventory (what you have)
3. Maps (where things are)
4. Weather logs (predict patterns)
5. Construction notes (replicate success)

PRESERVATION BASICS:
□ Waterproof container
□ Dark/cool storage
□ Elevated (not on floor)
□ Multiple copies
□ Regular review/update

IF YOU WRITE NOTHING ELSE:
• Who you are (ID, blood type, allergies)
• Where you are (coordinates, landmarks)
• What you have (core resources)
• How to do critical skills (fire, water, first aid)

Remember: Memory fails. Paper persists. 
Document now, survive later.
```

**Final Truth:** The difference between a group that survives and one that thrives is documentation. Knowledge shared is knowledge squared.
