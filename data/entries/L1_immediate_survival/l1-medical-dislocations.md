summary: Dislocations occur when a bone is forced out of its joint socket. Shoulders and fingers are most common. Field reduction (putting the joint back) should only be attempted when medical care is unavailable
  — improper technique can cause nerve and blood vessel damage.
warnings:
- NEVER attempt field reduction if you suspect a fracture near the joint — this can cause catastrophic nerve/vessel damage
- Shoulder reduction should ideally be done within 1-2 hours — muscle spasm increases over time making reduction progressively harder
- Check pulse, sensation, and movement BEFORE and AFTER any reduction attempt
- If the joint will not reduce with gentle sustained traction in 2-3 attempts, STOP — splint in position found and evacuate
steps:
- 'SHOULDER — Cunningham technique (safest field method): have patient sit upright in a chair. Massage the trapezius (upper back/neck muscle) firmly for 2-3 minutes to relax spasm. Then massage the deltoid
  (shoulder cap) for 2-3 minutes. Then massage the bicep for 2-3 minutes. While massaging, ask patient to slowly shrug shoulders up toward ears and pull shoulder blades together. The shoulder often self-reduces
  during this sequence.'
- 'SHOULDER — External rotation method: patient lies on back. Elbow bent to 90°. Slowly rotate forearm outward (palm toward ceiling) while keeping elbow against the body. Move very slowly — 2-3 minutes
  to reach full external rotation. The head of the humerus slides back into the socket. Stop if patient reports sharp increase in pain.'
- 'SHOULDER — Stimson technique: patient lies face-down on elevated surface (table, log) with affected arm hanging straight down. Hang 5-10 lbs weight from the wrist (water bottle in a bag). Wait 15-30
  minutes. Gravity and muscle relaxation do the work. Safest method — lowest force.'
- 'AFTER SHOULDER REDUCTION: immediate sling-and-swath (arm against chest, bound to torso). Keep immobilized for 2-3 weeks. The joint is unstable and will re-dislocate easily.'
- 'FINGER DISLOCATION: usually obvious — finger bent at wrong angle. Grasp the dislocated segment firmly. Pull steady traction along the axis of the finger while gently guiding it back into alignment. You''ll
  feel/hear a ''clunk'' as it seats. Buddy-tape to adjacent finger for 2-3 weeks.'
- 'Check circulation after any reduction: pulse present, skin color normal, sensation intact, can wiggle fingers/toes. If circulation is compromised before reduction, that''s actually an indication to attempt
  reduction urgently — the joint is compressing blood vessels.'

# Shoulder and Finger Dislocation Reduction

Dislocations occur when a bone is forced out of its joint socket. Shoulders and fingers are most common. Field reduction (putting the joint back) should only be attempted when medical care is unavailable — improper technique can cause nerve and blood vessel damage.
