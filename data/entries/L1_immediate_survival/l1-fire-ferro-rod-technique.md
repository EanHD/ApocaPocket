summary: A ferrocerium rod (ferro rod) is the most reliable fire starter for field use — works when wet, at altitude, in wind, and produces 3000°C sparks. Success depends entirely on tinder preparation.
  The rod lasts thousands of strikes.
warnings:
- Ferro rod sparks are 3000°C — can ignite fuel, clothing, and volatile liquids. Be aware of surroundings.
- Scraping toward the tinder risks pushing the tinder bundle apart — learn to pull the rod backward instead
- Cheap ferro rods contain more iron and produce fewer, cooler sparks — invest in quality (>50% mischmetal)
- The black coating on new ferro rods must be scraped off to expose the alloy before first use
steps:
- 'TINDER PREPARATION (critical — this is where most people fail): you need material that catches spark and holds flame. Best natural tinders: birch bark (thin papery outer bark), cedar bark (shredded to
  cotton consistency), fatwood shavings (resin-saturated pine), cattail fluff, dried grass (crumbled fine), pine needles (dried), milkweed fluff, thistle down.'
- 'Prepare a tinder bundle: baseball-sized nest with the finest, driest material in the center, slightly coarser material around the outside. The spark must land on the finest material. This is a bird''s
  nest shape — hollow center.'
- 'ENHANCED TINDERS (carry these): cotton balls with petroleum jelly (coat thoroughly — burns 3-5 minutes), dryer lint, waxed cardboard, jute twine (pulled apart into fine fibers), charcloth (see char cloth
  entry). These are near-guaranteed to catch ferro rod sparks.'
- 'TECHNIQUE — Lock and scrape method (most reliable): hold the ferro rod stationary pressed against your tinder. Place the spine of your knife (or dedicated striker) on the rod. Pull the ROD BACKWARD while
  pressing the striker forward. This keeps the striker over the tinder and doesn''t disturb the bundle.'
- 'Alternative: push method — hold rod steady, push striker firmly along the rod toward the tinder. Faster but risks scattering tinder. Best for prepared tinders that won''t blow apart.'
- 'ANGLE: striker should meet the rod at 30-45°. Too shallow = shaving off metal without sparking. Too steep = sparks fly upward not forward. The sweet spot sends a shower of sparks directly into the tinder,
  2-3 inches away.'
- 'When tinder catches (you''ll see a glowing ember or small flame): gently blow with steady breaths to build it. Place into your pre-built fire lay (tinder → kindling → fuel, already assembled BEFORE you
  strike).'
- 'WET CONDITIONS: ferro rods work when wet — wipe dry on your shirt first. The challenge is dry tinder. Carry prepared tinder (petroleum jelly cotton balls) in a waterproof container. In the field, look
  inside dead standing trees, under bark slabs, in the center of dead grass clumps.'
- 'MAINTENANCE: ferro rods don''t expire. Store dry. If oxidation develops (white powder), scrape it off. A 6-inch rod provides 10,000-20,000 strikes. Carry a backup.'
