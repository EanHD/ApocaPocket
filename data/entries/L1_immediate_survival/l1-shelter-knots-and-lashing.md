summary: Key knots and lashing techniques needed for constructing field shelters.
steps:
- 'Bowline: creates fixed loop that won''t slip — use for ridgeline anchors.'
- 'Clove hitch: quick attachment to poles/trees — use for starting lashings.'
- 'Taut-line hitch: adjustable tension knot — use for guy lines on tarps.'
- 'Square lashing: binding two poles at right angles — use for frame construction.'
- 'Diagonal lashing: binding two poles crossing at angles — use for bracing.'
- 'Natural cordage: twist plant fibers (inner bark, grass, roots) into usable rope.'
warnings:
- Wet rope/cordage shrinks and tightens — account for this in shelters.
- Paracord inner strands can be extracted for lighter cordage needs.
- Natural cordage is weaker than manufactured — use thicker bundles for load-bearing.

## Overview
Key knots and lashing techniques needed for constructing field shelters.

## Step-by-step
1. Bowline: creates fixed loop that won't slip — use for ridgeline anchors.
2. Clove hitch: quick attachment to poles/trees — use for starting lashings.
3. Taut-line hitch: adjustable tension knot — use for guy lines on tarps.
4. Square lashing: binding two poles at right angles — use for frame construction.
5. Diagonal lashing: binding two poles crossing at angles — use for bracing.
6. Natural cordage: twist plant fibers (inner bark, grass, roots) into usable rope.

## Warnings
- Wet rope/cordage shrinks and tightens — account for this in shelters.
- Paracord inner strands can be extracted for lighter cordage needs.
- Natural cordage is weaker than manufactured — use thicker bundles for load-bearing.
