summary: 'Predicting weather without forecast: observe clouds, wind shifts, air pressure signs, animal behavior. High wispy clouds (cirrus) indicate weather change in 24 hours. Darkening clouds = storm
  approaching. Sudden wind shift = front moving through.'
warnings:
- Weather signs are general trends - not precise forecasts
- Mountain and coastal weather is unpredictable
- Severe weather can develop rapidly (thunderstorms, tornadoes) - seek shelter at first signs
steps:
- 'CLOUDS: Cirrus (high wispy) - weather change coming. Cumulus (puffy white) - fair weather if morning, storms if build tall in afternoon. Cumulonimbus (towering dark) - thunderstorms imminent. Stratus
  (low gray sheet) - drizzle or snow.'
- 'WIND: Steady wind from one direction = stable weather. Sudden shift or swirling = front approaching (expect rain/storms).'
- 'PRESSURE SIGNS: Difficulty starting fire (damp air, low pressure) = rain coming. Clear sharp distant views = high pressure, fair weather. Hazy distant views = moisture in air, rain possible.'
- 'ANIMAL BEHAVIOR: Birds flying low = low pressure, rain coming. Insects swarm = fair weather. Cattle lying down = rain coming (folklore, somewhat reliable).'
- 'RED SKY: Red sky at morning, sailors take warning (rain coming). Red sky at night, sailors delight (fair weather). Based on sunset light through moisture.'

# Weather Prediction — Cloud Types & Natural Signs

Predicting weather without forecast: observe clouds, wind shifts, air pressure signs, animal behavior. High wispy clouds (cirrus) indicate weather change in 24 hours. Darkening clouds = storm approaching. Sudden wind shift = front moving through.
