audit_status: verified
difficulty: beginner-intermediate
time_required: 5-15 minutes (per configuration)
materials_needed:
- Tarp (8×10 ft minimum, 10×12 ft ideal, silnylon or polyethylene)
- Paracord or rope (50-100 ft total, 4-5mm diameter)
- Stakes (6-10 tent stakes or carved wooden stakes)
- Optional: trekking poles for supports, small stones for button method
summary: 'A tarp is the most versatile shelter tool — a single 8×10 or 10×10 tarp can create 8+ distinct shelter configurations depending on weather, terrain, and number of occupants. Weight: 1-2 lbs. Setup
  time: 5-15 minutes. Packed size: football-sized bundle.'
warnings:
- ALWAYS orient the low/closed side toward prevailing wind — wind under a tarp creates sail effect and collapses it
- Tarp shelters provide NO insulation — you need ground insulation (see ground insulation entry) or you will lose body heat to the ground faster than the air
- Grommets are the weakest point — reinforce with small round stones wrapped in the tarp corner (button method) for additional tie points
- In lightning-prone areas, avoid tall ridgepoles or metal trekking poles as uprights
steps:
- 'A-FRAME: ridgeline between two trees at chest height. Drape tarp over line, stake both sides at 45° angle. PROS: best rain protection, sheds wind, fast setup. CONS: low headroom, enclosed feeling. BEST
  FOR: steady rain, cold nights.'
- 'LEAN-TO: tie one edge to a ridgeline at shoulder height, stake opposite edge to ground. PROS: open front for fire reflection, good headroom on one side, easy. CONS: no protection from wind reversal or
  diagonal rain. BEST FOR: calm conditions with a fire in front.'
- 'C-FLY / DIAMOND FLY: hang tarp from center point like a diamond (corner-to-corner). One corner staked high to a tree, opposite corner staked to ground. Side corners staked out. PROS: excellent rain runoff,
  360° visibility, great ventilation. CONS: less rain coverage at sides. BEST FOR: warm rainy conditions, tropical.'
- 'PLOUGH POINT: one corner tied high to a tree, opposite two corners staked wide at ground level, remaining corner staked close to ground behind you. Creates a pointed windbreak. PROS: excellent wind protection
  from one direction, good headroom. CONS: open sides. BEST FOR: strong directional wind.'
- 'HALF PYRAMID: one edge tied to ridgeline at hip height, opposite edge staked to ground. But fold the ground-edge under and stake it to create a floor/groundsheet on one half. PROS: built-in ground protection
  for gear, decent rain shed. CONS: small sleeping area.'
- 'CORNET / BURRITO: wrap tarp completely around you like a tube. Fold one end under as ground sheet, gather and tie the other end. PROS: full weather protection, warmest option, requires no poles or trees.
  CONS: claustrophobic, condensation, no ventilation. BEST FOR: emergency bivouac, extreme cold.'
- 'ADIRONDACK: like a lean-to but with the back portion folded under as a ground sheet and the front angled at 45°. Side edges can be folded in and staked to create wind walls. Requires a larger tarp (10×10+).
  PROS: rain protection + ground sheet + wind walls from one tarp. CONS: complex setup. BEST FOR: multi-day camps.'
- 'HAMMOCK TARP (RIDGELINE): if sleeping in a hammock, set ridgeline 12 inches above hammock. Drape tarp in A-frame configuration with 6-12 inch drip lines hanging below the tarp edges (prevents water from
  running down tie-outs to hammock). Stake sides at 30° for maximum coverage. PROS: off-ground sleeping + rain protection. CONS: requires trees at correct spacing (10-14 feet).'
- 'KNOTS NEEDED: taught-line hitch (adjustable ridgeline tension), bowline (non-slip loop at tie points), clove hitch (attaching to trees/poles), trucker''s hitch (mechanical advantage for tight lines).'
- 'GENERAL RULES: ridgeline should be TAUT (use trucker''s hitch for tension). All guy lines should angle at 45° from tarp for optimal stability and rain shedding. Dig a shallow trench (2-3" deep) around the uphill perimeter if rain is heavy to divert water. Door/opening faces away from wind. Add a space blanket under the tarp for radiant heat reflection (increases warmth 15-20°F).'
- 'STAKE PLACEMENT: drive stakes at 45° angle away from tarp (not vertical) for maximum holding power. Use rock behind stake in soft soil. Stake distance: 2-4 ft from tarp edge depending on guyline length and desired tarp angle.'
- 'TARP SPECIFICATIONS: Size: 8×10 ft for 1-2 people, 10×12 ft for 2-3 people, 12×12 ft for 3-4 or group gear. Material: silnylon (lightest, 8-16 oz), polyethylene (cheapest, 1.5-3 lbs), canvas (heaviest but durable, 4-6 lbs). Grommets: minimum 6 (corners + midpoints), 8-12 ideal for flexibility.'
- 'RIDGELINE SETUP: use 1/8" paracord or larger. Height: 4-5 ft for most setups, 5-6 ft for lean-to with tall person. Tension: tight enough that ridgeline doesn''t sag when tarp draped. Use trucker''s hitch or tensioner for easy adjustment.'
- 'PRACTICE DRILL: set up each configuration once in good weather to learn rigging before needing it in rain/dark. Time yourself: A-frame <5 min, lean-to <3 min, diamond fly <7 min. Mark your preferred tie-out points with small loops of colored cord for fast identification in field.'

# Tarp Shelter Configurations — 8 Setups

A tarp is the most versatile shelter tool — a single 8×10 or 10×10 tarp can create 8+ distinct shelter configurations depending on weather, terrain, and number of occupants. Weight: 1-2 lbs. Setup time: 5-15 minutes. Packed size: football-sized bundle.

## Configuration Quick Reference

| Config | Setup Time | Rain | Wind | Warmth | Headroom |
|--------|-----------|------|------|--------|----------|
| A-frame | 5 min | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★ |
| Lean-to | 3 min | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ |
| Diamond Fly | 7 min | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★★★ |
| Plough Point | 6 min | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ |
| Half Pyramid | 5 min | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
| Cornet | 2 min | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★ |
| Adirondack | 12 min | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ |
| Hammock | 8 min | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ |
