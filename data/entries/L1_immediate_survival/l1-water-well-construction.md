summary: A hand-dug well reaches the water table to provide a reliable water source. Wells 10-30 feet deep can be dug with hand tools in 1-4 weeks depending on soil. A properly constructed and protected
  well provides clean water for decades.
warnings:
- 'CAVE-IN IS THE #1 KILLER in well digging — always shore/line the walls as you dig. Never dig below un-shored walls.'
- Wells deeper than 10 feet require a ventilation system — carbon dioxide and methane accumulate in deep holes. Test with a candle lowered on a string — if it goes out, the air is dangerous. Ventilate before
  entering.
- Never dig alone — always have a person on the surface with a rope and the ability to pull you out.
- Contaminated wells kill more people worldwide than almost any other water issue — protection and sanitation are as important as the digging
steps:
- 'SITE SELECTION: locate at least 100 feet from any latrine, animal pen, or waste area. DOWNHILL from clean areas, UPHILL from contamination sources. Look for areas where the water table is likely shallow
  — near rivers/streams (but not in the flood plain), where vegetation is lush, where neighbors have successful wells.'
- 'DIAMETER: 3-5 feet is standard for hand-dug wells. This gives enough room to work inside. Round cross-section is strongest against collapse.'
- 'DIGGING: use a pick to loosen soil, shovel into a bucket, haul bucket up with rope and pulley. Line walls as you go — stone, brick, concrete rings, or tightly fitted timber. Each section of lining must
  be installed before digging further down.'
- 'WATER TABLE: you''ll know when you hit it — the hole starts filling with water. Dig 3-5 feet below the water table to create a reservoir. Bail water as you dig (bucket on a rope). This is the hardest
  part — you''re digging in water.'
- 'WELL LINING: most critical in the upper 10 feet where surface contamination can enter. Use impermeable material (concrete, clay, stone with cement mortar). Below the water table, use permeable lining
  (dry-stacked stone or gravel) to let water enter.'
- 'WELL HEAD: the top of the well must extend 1-2 feet above ground level. Build a concrete or stone apron sloping away from the well (3-foot radius minimum). Install a sealed cover or cap. This prevents
  surface water, animals, and debris from entering.'
- 'PUMPING: simplest is a rope-and-bucket (sanitary risk if bucket touches contaminated surfaces). Better: a hand pump. Simplest DIY pump: a cylinder with a check valve and plunger (see pump design entry).
  Even a simple bailer (tube with a check valve on the bottom, lowered on a rope) is more sanitary than an open bucket.'
- 'DISINFECTION: new wells should be disinfected before use. Pour a chlorine solution (1 cup bleach per 100 gallons of well water) into the well. Let sit 24 hours. Pump/bail until chlorine smell is gone.
  Water should be tested (or at minimum, boiled) for the first week.'
- 'MAINTENANCE: check cover integrity monthly. Test water clarity and taste regularly. If water becomes turbid after rain, surface contamination is entering — improve the well head seal and surface drainage.'

# Hand-Dug Well Construction

A hand-dug well reaches the water table to provide a reliable water source. Wells 10-30 feet deep can be dug with hand tools in 1-4 weeks depending on soil. A properly constructed and protected well provides clean water for decades.
