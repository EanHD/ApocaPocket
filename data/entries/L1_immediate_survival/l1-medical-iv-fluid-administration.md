# IV Fluid Administration - Intravenous Access and Fluid Therapy

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️

**This is an ADVANCED medical procedure requiring formal training.** 

- **Legal:** Performing IV insertion without proper credentials is illegal in most jurisdictions
- **Training required:** Practice on training arms, supervised clinical hours, certification
- **Infection risk:** Improper technique can cause sepsis (blood infection), which is fatal without antibiotics
- **Use only when:** Oral/rectal routes impossible AND patient's life depends on IV access (severe dehydration, shock, unconsciousness)

**This entry is for:**
- Trained medical personnel in resource-limited settings
- Wilderness medicine scenarios where evacuation is delayed >24 hours
- Collapse scenarios where no formal medical care exists

**If medical care is available within 6-8 hours, maintain oral hydration and transport instead.**

---

## Overview

Intravenous (IV) access allows direct delivery of fluids, medications, and blood products into the bloodstream. In emergencies, IV fluid administration can save lives when patients cannot drink (unconscious, vomiting, severe shock).

**When IV access is needed:**
- Severe dehydration with inability to drink (>10% body weight loss)
- Hypovolemic shock (blood loss, severe burns)
- Unconscious patient requiring hydration
- Medication delivery (antibiotics, pain control, seizure medications)
- Heat stroke requiring rapid cooling

**Oral rehydration is ALWAYS preferred if patient can drink and absorb fluids.** IV therapy has higher infection and complication risks.

---

## Anatomy: Vein Selection

### Upper Extremity Veins (First Choice)

#### 1. **Dorsal Hand Veins** (Easiest to see, most accessible)
- **Location:** Back of hand, between metacarpal bones
- **Advantages:** Easy to visualize, low infection risk, easy to secure
- **Disadvantages:** Small veins, painful, limits hand use, easy to dislodge
- **Best for:** Short-term access, conscious patients, small fluid volumes

#### 2. **Cephalic Vein** (Thumb Side)
- **Location:** Runs along radial (thumb) side of forearm, from wrist to elbow
- **Anatomical landmark:** Follow thumb line up forearm, vein runs parallel to radius bone
- **Advantages:** Large, straight, easy to palpate, stable placement
- **Disadvantages:** May be mobile (rolls when inserting needle)
- **Best for:** Moderate to large fluid volumes, longer-term access

#### 3. **Basilic Vein** (Pinky Side)
- **Location:** Runs along ulnar (pinky) side of forearm, from wrist to elbow
- **Anatomical landmark:** Follow pinky line up inner forearm
- **Advantages:** Often large and visible, good for larger catheters
- **Disadvantages:** Close to arteries and nerves in upper arm (stay mid-forearm)
- **Best for:** Larger catheters, rapid fluid administration

#### 4. **Median Antecubital Veins** (Elbow Pit)
- **Location:** Inside of elbow (antecubital fossa)
- **Three veins:** Median cubital (most prominent), median cephalic, median basilic
- **Anatomical landmark:** Center of elbow crease
- **Advantages:** Very large, easy to find, excellent for rapid fluid delivery
- **Disadvantages:** Limits arm movement, easy to kink/dislodge with arm bending
- **Best for:** Emergency access, unconscious patients, rapid resuscitation

#### 5. **External Jugular Vein** (ADVANCED - neck)
- **Location:** Side of neck, runs from jaw angle to clavicle
- **Anatomical landmark:** Turn head to opposite side, vein becomes visible
- **Advantages:** Large, accessible when peripheral veins collapsed (shock)
- **Disadvantages:** High infection risk, uncomfortable, difficult to secure, air embolism risk
- **Best for:** Severe shock when no peripheral veins accessible, LAST RESORT

### Vein Assessment: The "3 S's"

1. **See:** Can you visualize the vein? (straight blue line under skin)
2. **Straight:** Is the vein relatively straight for 2+ inches? (easier insertion)
3. **Spongy:** Does it feel spongy/bouncy when palpated? (healthy vein)

**Avoid veins that are:**
- Hard, cord-like (thrombosed - has blood clot)
- Very small (<2mm diameter visible)
- Over joints (will kink)
- Near infections, wounds, or burns
- On side of mastectomy or dialysis access

### Making Veins More Visible

**Techniques:**
1. **Gravity:** Hang arm down below heart for 30-60 seconds
2. **Tourniquet:** Tight band 4-6 inches above planned insertion site
3. **Tapping:** Gentle tapping over vein (not slapping - damages vein)
4. **Warmth:** Warm compress for 2-3 minutes (dilates veins)
5. **Fist pumping:** Have patient open/close fist 5-10 times
6. **Hydration:** If patient can drink, give 8-16oz water 30 min before

**DO NOT:**
- Slap the vein (causes bruising, makes insertion harder)
- Leave tourniquet on >2 minutes (causes blood clot risk)
- Use veins on legs unless absolutely no upper extremity access (higher clot risk)

## Equipment Needed

### Minimum Equipment
- [ ] **IV catheter** (14G-24G, size depends on need - see sizing below)
- [ ] **IV tubing** (drip set)
- [ ] **IV fluid bag** (see fluid types below)
- [ ] **Tourniquet** (rubber band, blood pressure cuff, or improvised)
- [ ] **Alcohol wipes** or antiseptic solution
- [ ] **Transparent dressing** or tape (secure catheter)
- [ ] **Gloves** (sterile if available, clean minimum)
- [ ] **Gauze pads** (2x2 or 4x4)
- [ ] **Sharps container** (or puncture-proof container for used needle)

### IV Catheter Sizing

| Gauge | Diameter | Color | Flow Rate | Best For |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 14G | 2.0mm | Orange | 300 mL/min | Massive trauma, rapid transfusion, surgery |
| 16G | 1.6mm | Gray | 180 mL/min | Trauma, rapid fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion |
| 18G | 1.2mm | Green | 90 mL/min | Most adults, general fluid therapy, medications |
| 20G | 0.9mm | Pink | 60 mL/min | Adults with small veins, standard hydration |
| 22G | 0.7mm | Blue | 35 mL/min | Children, elderly, fragile veins |
| 24G | 0.55mm | Yellow | 20 mL/min | Neonates, infants, very fragile veins |

**General rule:** Use largest catheter the vein can accommodate without trauma.

**Emergency situations:** 18G minimum (adults), 20-22G (children)

---

## Step-by-Step Insertion Technique

### 1. Preparation (5 minutes)

**Gather equipment:**
- Open sterile packages without contaminating contents
- Prime IV tubing (fill with fluid, remove all air bubbles)
  - Hang fluid bag on IV pole or elevated surface
  - Open roller clamp fully
  - Let fluid run through tubing until no air bubbles visible
  - Close roller clamp
  - Keep sterile end covered

**Patient preparation:**
- Explain procedure (reduces anxiety, movement)
- Position arm on flat surface, elbow slightly bent
- Apply tourniquet 4-6 inches (10-15cm) above planned insertion site
- Tourniquet should be tight enough to stop venous flow but NOT arterial flow
  - **Test:** You should still feel radial pulse at wrist
  - If no pulse = too tight (loosen)

### 2. Site Selection and Cleaning (2 minutes)

**Select vein:**
- Start distal (hand/wrist) and work proximal (elbow) - preserves veins for future attempts
- Choose straightest section possible (2+ inches)
- Avoid areas over joints, tendons, arteries

**Palpate vein:**
- Feel with index finger (not thumb - thumb has pulse, causes confusion)
- Vein should feel spongy, bouncy
- Trace path of vein with finger

**Clean site:**
- Scrub with alcohol/antiseptic in circular motion, working outward
- 30 seconds minimum (count to 30)
- Let air dry completely (10-20 seconds) - wet alcohol inactivates antiseptic
- **DO NOT touch site again** (re-contaminates)

### 3. Catheter Insertion (30-60 seconds)

**Stabilize vein:**
- Use non-dominant thumb to pull skin taut 1-2 inches below insertion site
- Prevents vein from rolling

**Insert catheter:**
1. Hold catheter in dominant hand like a pencil
2. **Bevel up** (opening of needle faces upward) - critical for smooth insertion
3. **Angle:** 10-30 degrees to skin
   - Shallow veins (can see clearly): 10-15 degrees
   - Deeper veins: 20-30 degrees
4. Warn patient: "Sharp stick coming"
5. Insert through skin FIRST, then advance into vein
   - Two-step process: skin → vein (not one motion)
6. **Watch for flashback** (blood appears in catheter chamber)
   - Flash = needle tip in vein
7. **Critical step:** Lower angle to nearly flat (almost parallel to skin)
8. Advance needle another 1-2mm to ensure catheter tip also in vein
9. **Hold needle still** with non-dominant hand
10. **Slide catheter forward** off needle into vein with dominant hand
    - Smooth, steady motion
    - Do NOT pull needle back yet (stabilizes catheter)
11. Once catheter fully advanced, release tourniquet
12. Apply pressure with finger over catheter tip (still inside vein) at skin entry point
    - Prevents blood flowing out when you remove needle
13. Remove needle, dispose in sharps container immediately
14. Blood will well up at catheter hub (normal)

### 4. Connection and Securing (2 minutes)

**Connect IV tubing:**
- Quickly attach primed IV tubing to catheter hub
- Twist to lock (Luer lock design)
- Open roller clamp, watch for fluid drip in drip chamber
- **Look for swelling at IV site:**
  - No swelling = catheter in vein ✓
  - Swelling = catheter in tissue (infiltration) - remove and restart

**Secure catheter:**
- Wipe any blood with gauze
- Apply transparent dressing over insertion site
  - Can see site through dressing (monitor for problems)
- Secure tubing with tape in loop (prevents pulling catheter out)
- Write date/time on dressing (track how long IV has been in place)

### 5. Set Flow Rate (see calculations below)

## Fluid Types and Selection

### Crystalloids (Most Common)

#### **Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl)**
- **Composition:** 154 mEq/L sodium, 154 mEq/L chloride
- **Uses:** 
  - Trauma/hemorrhagic shock (replaces blood volume)
  - Dehydration from vomiting/diarrhea
  - Medication dilution
- **Advantages:** Compatible with blood products, widely available
- **Disadvantages:** Large volumes can cause hyperchloremic acidosis (too much chloride)
- **Shelf life:** 2-3 years (check expiration)

#### **Lactated Ringer's (LR)**
- **Composition:** Sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, lactate (buffers pH)
- **Uses:**
  - Trauma resuscitation (preferred over NS by many)
  - Burns
  - General dehydration
- **Advantages:** More physiologic (closer to body's electrolyte balance)
- **Disadvantages:** Cannot use with blood products (calcium causes clotting)
- **Shelf life:** 2-3 years

#### **Dextrose 5% in Water (D5W)**
- **Composition:** 5% glucose in water
- **Uses:**
  - Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
  - Maintenance hydration (not resuscitation)
- **Disadvantages:** Does NOT stay in bloodstream (rapidly moves into cells), ineffective for shock
- **Shelf life:** 2-3 years

### Colloids (Less Common, More Expensive)

**Examples:** Albumin, hetastarch
**Uses:** Severe shock, burns (when crystalloids insufficient)
**Advantages:** Stay in bloodstream longer
**Disadvantages:** Expensive, shorter shelf life, allergic reactions possible

### Emergency Fluid Selection

| Situation | First Choice | Second Choice |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Trauma/bleeding | Lactated Ringer's | Normal Saline |
| Dehydration (vomiting/diarrhea) | Normal Saline | Lactated Ringer's |
| Burns | Lactated Ringer's | Normal Saline |
| Low blood sugar | D5W | Normal Saline + oral sugar if conscious |
| Heat stroke | Normal Saline | Lactated Ringer's |

**When in doubt: Normal Saline** (most versatile, compatible with everything)

## Flow Rate Calculation

### Drip Rate Formula

**Flow Rate (drops/min) = (Volume in mL × Drop Factor) ÷ Time in minutes**

**Drop Factor** (depends on tubing type):
- Standard tubing: 10-15 drops/mL
- Micro-drip tubing: 60 drops/mL
- **Check your tubing package** for drop factor

### Example Calculations

**Example 1:** Give 1000mL over 8 hours using 15 drop/mL tubing
- Volume: 1000mL
- Time: 8 hours = 480 minutes
- Drop factor: 15 drops/mL
- **Calculation:** (1000 × 15) ÷ 480 = 31 drops/minute

**Example 2:** Give 500mL over 4 hours using 10 drop/mL tubing
- Volume: 500mL
- Time: 4 hours = 240 minutes
- Drop factor: 10 drops/mL
- **Calculation:** (500 × 10) ÷ 240 = 21 drops/minute

### Quick Reference: Common Flow Rates

**Adult Maintenance** (standard hydration, not emergency):
- 125 mL/hr = ~31 drops/min (15 drop factor)
- This is about 1 drop every 2 seconds

**Adult Resuscitation** (shock, severe dehydration):
- **Initial bolus:** 500-1000mL over 15-30 minutes = wide open
- Then reassess and slow to maintenance

**Pediatric Maintenance:**
- **Formula:** 4 mL/kg/hr for first 10kg + 2 mL/kg/hr for next 10kg + 1 mL/kg/hr for each kg above 20kg
- **Example:** 25kg child = (4×10) + (2×10) + (1×5) = 65 mL/hr

**Pediatric Resuscitation:**
- **Bolus:** 20 mL/kg over 15-20 minutes
- **Example:** 25kg child = 500mL bolus
- May repeat up to 60 mL/kg total if still in shock

### Setting the Flow Rate

**Using roller clamp:**
1. Open clamp completely (wide open)
2. Count drops in drip chamber for 15 seconds
3. Multiply by 4 = drops per minute
4. Adjust clamp until you reach target drops/minute
5. Recount every 15 minutes (flow drifts)

**Wide open** (emergency): Roller clamp fully open, squeeze bag to increase pressure

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### What to Monitor

**Every 15 minutes for first hour, then hourly:**
- [ ] IV site (redness, swelling, pain)
- [ ] Flow rate (count drops, adjust if needed)
- [ ] Patient symptoms (feeling better? worse?)
- [ ] Urine output (goal: 30-50 mL/hr adult, 1 mL/kg/hr child)
- [ ] Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate)
- [ ] Fluid remaining in bag (plan next bag)

### Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **No flow** | Clamp closed | Open clamp |
| | Catheter against vein wall | Rotate catheter slightly, adjust arm position |
| | Catheter kinked | Straighten arm |
| | IV bag too low | Elevate bag higher (gravity drives flow) |
| | Blood clot in catheter | Flush with 5-10mL saline, if no flow → remove and restart |
| **Swelling at site** | Infiltration (catheter not in vein) | Stop IV, remove catheter, elevate arm, restart in different site |
| **Pain at site** | Irritation from fluid | Slow flow rate |
| | Infiltration | Remove and restart |
| | Phlebitis (vein inflammation) | Apply warm compress, restart different site |
| **Blood backing up tubing** | Bag empty | Change bag |
| | Bag lower than arm | Elevate bag |
| **Air bubbles in tubing** | Connection loose | Tighten connections, re-prime line |

### Complications (Serious)

#### **Infiltration/Extravasation**
- **Signs:** Swelling, coolness, pain at IV site
- **Action:** Stop IV, remove catheter, elevate arm, apply warm compress (increases absorption), restart in different site
- **Prevention:** Secure catheter well, avoid sites over joints

#### **Phlebitis (Vein Inflammation)**
- **Signs:** Redness, warmth, pain along vein, red streaking
- **Action:** Remove IV, apply warm compress, restart different site, monitor for infection
- **Prevention:** Use smallest catheter possible, change IV site every 72-96 hours

#### **Infection/Sepsis**
- **Signs:** Fever, chills, pus at IV site, red streaking up arm
- **Action:** Remove IV immediately, clean site, **START ANTIBIOTICS** (see antibiotic guide entry), seek advanced care
- **Prevention:** Sterile technique, clean site thoroughly, change site every 72-96 hours

#### **Air Embolism** (Air Bubble in Bloodstream)
- **Signs:** Sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion (rare but life-threatening)
- **Action:** Clamp IV immediately, lay patient on LEFT side with head down (traps air in right heart chamber), seek advanced care immediately
- **Prevention:** Prime tubing completely, check for bubbles, never leave IV line open to air

#### **Fluid Overload** (Too Much Fluid Too Fast)
- **Signs:** Shortness of breath, coughing, crackles in lungs, swelling in feet/legs
- **Action:** STOP IV or slow to minimal rate, sit patient upright, monitor breathing
- **Prevention:** Follow flow rate guidelines, don't exceed 40-50 mL/kg total without advanced monitoring

---

## When to Remove IV

**Routine removal:**
- Patient able to drink and absorb oral fluids
- Dehydration/shock resolved
- 72-96 hours elapsed (infection risk increases)
- No longer needed for medications

**Urgent removal:**
- Signs of infection (redness, pus, fever)
- Significant pain at site
- Catheter obviously not in vein (infiltration)
- Phlebitis (vein inflammation)

**Removal technique:**
1. Close clamp, stop fluid flow
2. Remove tape/dressing
3. Hold gauze over insertion site
4. Pull catheter straight out (smooth motion)
5. Apply firm pressure for 2-3 minutes
6. Apply bandage
7. Inspect catheter (ensure entire catheter removed - measure if concerned)
8. Dispose in sharps container

---

## IV Site Care

**Daily (while IV in place):**
- Check site every 4-8 hours
- Change dressing if wet, soiled, or loose
- Clean site with alcohol if dressing change needed
- Flush IV with 5-10mL saline every 8 hours if not actively infusing (keeps catheter open)

**Changing IV bag:**
- Never let bag run completely empty (air enters line)
- Change bag when 50-100mL remaining
- Close clamp on old bag
- Remove old bag, spike new bag with same tubing
- Open clamp, check for flow
- No need to re-prime if done properly (no air introduced)

---

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Bevel down insertion | Bevel up (opening faces upward) for smooth entry |
| Inserting too fast | Slow, controlled insertion - feel for "pop" into vein |
| Advancing catheter before flashback | Wait for blood return, then advance |
| Pulling needle out before advancing catheter fully | Catheter must be fully in vein before removing needle |
| Not releasing tourniquet before connecting tubing | Release tourniquet after catheter advanced |
| Touching cleaned site before insertion | Once cleaned and dry, DO NOT touch (re-contamination) |
| Inserting at steep angle (>30 degrees) | Shallow angle (10-30 degrees) - steep angles go through back wall of vein |
| Leaving tourniquet on >2 minutes | Loosen after 1-2 minutes, reapply if needed |
| Starting at elbow (antecubital) | Start distal (hand/wrist), preserve proximal veins for later |
| Not flushing IV when not actively infusing | Flush every 8 hours with 5-10mL saline (prevents clotting) |

---

## Emergency Scenarios

### Severe Dehydration
**Protocol:**
1. Insert 18G IV (adults) or 20-22G (children)
2. Normal Saline or Lactated Ringer's
3. **Adults:** 1000mL bolus over 30 minutes, reassess, repeat if needed
4. **Children:** 20 mL/kg bolus over 20 minutes, reassess, may repeat up to 60 mL/kg total
5. Goal: Improved mental status, urine output >30mL/hr, normal vital signs
6. Switch to maintenance rate once resuscitated

### Hemorrhagic Shock (Blood Loss)
**Protocol:**
1. Control bleeding first (see severe bleeding entry)
2. Two large-bore IVs (16-18G) if possible
3. Lactated Ringer's or Normal Saline
4. **Adults:** 1000mL bolus wide open, repeat as needed
5. **Goal:** Systolic BP >90 mmHg, pulse <100 bpm
6. **Permissive hypotension** if ongoing bleeding: Target SBP 80-90 (too much fluid increases bleeding)
7. Blood transfusion needed if no improvement after 2-3L crystalloid

### Heat Stroke
**Protocol:**
1. 18G IV
2. Normal Saline (room temperature or cool, NOT ice cold)
3. 1000mL over 30 minutes
4. External cooling simultaneously (wet patient, fan, ice packs to groin/armpits/neck)
5. Goal: Core temperature <102°F (39°C), mental status improved

### Unconscious Patient (Unable to Drink)
**Protocol:**
1. 18-20G IV
2. Normal Saline
3. Maintenance rate: 125 mL/hr (adults)
4. Monitor urine output (goal 30-50 mL/hr)
5. Reassess hydration status every 4 hours

---

## Field Considerations

### When Medical Care Unavailable

**IV site longevity:**
- Change site every 72-96 hours (infection prevention)
- Can extend to 5-7 days if absolutely necessary (monitor closely for infection signs)

**Sterility in field:**
- Boil instruments if possible
- Use cleanest alcohol/antiseptic available
- Gloves critical (improvise with plastic bags if needed)
- Clean site thoroughly (60 seconds if no antiseptic, just clean water)

**Fluid conservation:**
- Don't waste fluids - calculate total needs
- Oral rehydration whenever possible (more effective long-term, safer)
- 1L IV fluid = 2-3L oral fluids replaced (IV stays in bloodstream better)

**Limited supplies:**
- Single IV catheter = use wisely, don't remove unless necessary
- Reuse tubing if sterile technique maintained (change every 72 hours)
- Improvised IV pole: tree branch, rope, backpack hung high

### Sanitation and Infection Control

**Critical practices:**
- Wash hands (soap and water or alcohol gel) before procedure
- Clean skin thoroughly before insertion
- Use sterile or clean gloves
- Don't touch catheter tip or hub
- Dressing must stay clean and dry
- Remove at first sign of infection

**Infection rates:**
- Clean technique: ~5% infection rate
- Dirty/contaminated: 20-50% infection rate
- **Oral route almost never causes systemic infection** - use when possible

---

## When to Seek Advanced Medical Care

**Immediate evacuation/advanced care needed:**
- Signs of sepsis (fever >101.5°F, chills, confusion, rapid heartbeat)
- Air embolism suspected (chest pain, shortness of breath after IV start)
- Unable to establish IV access after 3 attempts AND patient deteriorating
- Fluid overload (pulmonary edema - shortness of breath, coughing frothy sputum)
- Suspected blood clot in vein (pain, swelling, redness, warmth along entire limb)

**Seek care when available:**
- Phlebitis (vein inflammation)
- Infiltration injury with significant swelling/pain
- Need for IV access >5-7 days
- Difficulty maintaining adequate flow rates
