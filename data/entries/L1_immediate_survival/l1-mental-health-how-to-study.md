# How to Study: Learning New Skills Fast

## Why This Matters
**In survival scenarios, the ability to learn quickly = competitive advantage.** New threats require new solutions. The faster you can acquire and apply knowledge, the better your odds.

## Memory Techniques

### Spaced Repetition (SRS)
**The Science:** Your brain forgets 50% of new info within 24 hours (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve). Reviewing at optimal intervals cements long-term memory.

**The Schedule:**
- **1st review:** 1 day after learning
- **2nd review:** 3 days after 1st review
- **3rd review:** 7 days after 2nd review
- **4th review:** 30 days after 3rd review
- **Maintenance:** Quarterly thereafter

**Time investment:** 5-10 minutes per review session
**Retention boost:** 80-90% vs 20-30% without review

### Chunking
**The Science:** Working memory holds 7±2 items (Miller's Law). Break complex information into digestible chunks.

**Examples:**
- Phone number: 555-123-4567 (3 chunks, not 10 digits)
- Plant ID: "Oak = lobed leaves + acorns + rough bark" (3 features)
- Radio protocol: "Who-What-Where-When-How" (5 W's)

**Application:**
1. Identify the 3-7 core concepts
2. Give each chunk a memorable label
3. Learn chunks one at a time
4. Combine once each is solid

**Time to mastery:** 20-40% faster than learning linearly

### Memory Palaces (Method of Loci)
**The Science:** Spatial memory is ancient and robust. Associate information with physical locations you know well.

**How to Build One:**
1. Pick a familiar route (your home, a trail, a building)
2. Identify 10-20 distinct locations along the route
3. Place vivid mental images at each location
4. Walk through mentally to recall

**Example:** Learning edible plants
- Front door = Dandelion (yellow door mat)
- Kitchen = Cattail (tall reeds in sink)
- Bedroom = Acorns (scattered on bed)

**Time to create:** 30-60 minutes for a 20-location palace
**Retention:** 2-3x better than rote memorization

### Active Recall
**The Science:** Retrieval practice strengthens neural pathways more than re-reading.

**Methods:**
- **Flashcards:** Question on front, answer on back
- **Blank paper test:** Write everything you remember (no peeking)
- **Teach-back:** Explain to someone (or pretend to)
- **Quiz yourself:** Create questions as you learn

**Don't:** Re-read passively. Highlight text. Copy notes word-for-word.
**Do:** Close the book and force yourself to remember.

**Difficulty sweet spot:** Should be challenging but not impossible. Aim for 70-85% correct on first try.

### Teaching Method
**The Science:** Teaching forces you to organize knowledge, identify gaps, and explain clearly. The Feynman Technique in action.

**Steps:**
1. Pick your topic
2. Explain it out loud as if teaching a beginner
3. Notice where you stumble (knowledge gaps)
4. Go back and study those gaps
5. Simplify your explanation (use analogies)

**Time investment:** 15-30 minutes per concept
**Benefit:** Deepens understanding, exposes blind spots

## Practice Schedules

### Deliberate Practice
**The Science:** Experts don't practice what they're good at—they drill their weak points.

**Framework:**
1. **Identify weakness:** What specific skill needs work?
2. **Isolated drill:** Practice just that component
3. **Immediate feedback:** Know if you got it right/wrong
4. **Repeat:** Until it's automatic

**Example:** Fire-starting
- Weak at: Getting tinder to catch spark
- Drill: 20 reps focusing only on tinder prep and spark catching
- Feedback: Did it catch? How fast?

**Time to improvement:** Noticeable gains in 1-2 hours of focused work

### The 20-Hour Rule
**The Science:** Josh Kaufman's research: ~20 hours of focused practice = basic competency in any skill.

**Requirements:**
- **Focused:** No distractions, full attention
- **Structured:** Follow a good method, not random trial
- **Feedback:** Know when you're doing it right

**Breakdown:**
- 30 min/day × 40 days = 20 hours
- 1 hour/day × 20 days = 20 hours
- 2 hours/day × 10 days = 20 hours

**Reality check:** Basic competency ≠ mastery. But it's enough to be functional.

### Flow State
**The Science:** Optimal learning happens when challenge matches skill level (Csikszentmihalyi).

**Flow conditions:**
- **Too easy:** Boring, mind wanders, no learning
- **Too hard:** Anxiety, frustration, give up
- **Just right:** Engaged, focused, time flies

**Calibration:**
- If bored: Increase difficulty (add constraints, speed up, combine skills)
- If frustrated: Decrease difficulty (break down further, slow down, get help)

**Signs you're in flow:**
- Lose track of time
- Fully absorbed
- Actions feel automatic
- Progress feels satisfying

## Study Environment

### Physical Setup
**The Science:** Environment affects cognition. Optimize for focus and comfort.

**Checklist:**
- **Light:** Natural light best, bright artificial if not (dim = drowsy)
- **Temperature:** 65-70°F optimal (too hot/cold = distraction)
- **Noise:** Quiet or consistent (white noise OK, intermittent noise = broken focus)
- **Comfort:** Good posture, not too comfortable (bed = sleep signal)
- **Tools ready:** Books, notes, water, snacks (avoid mid-session interruptions)

### Mental Setup
**Eliminate distractions:**
- Phone on silent, face-down (or different room)
- Close unneeded tabs/apps
- Tell others you're studying (no interruptions)
- Set a timer (time-boxed focus sessions)

**Pomodoro Technique:** 25 min focus + 5 min break × 4 = 2 hours of quality work

## Application Scenarios

**Learning plant identification:**
1. Chunk: Focus on 1-2 key features per plant
2. Active recall: Quiz yourself with photos
3. Spaced repetition: Review weekly
4. Teaching: Explain to someone else

**Mastering a repair skill:**
1. Deliberate practice: Drill the hardest step
2. 20-hour rule: Spend focused time with real materials
3. Flow: Start simple, increase complexity
4. Teaching: Document what you learned

**Memorizing critical information:**
1. Memory palace: Map data to familiar locations
2. Chunking: Group into logical sets
3. Active recall: Test yourself regularly
4. Spaced repetition: Review on schedule

## Quick Reference Card

```
EFFECTIVE STUDY CHECKLIST:

□ Practice weak points (deliberate practice)
□ Match challenge to skill (flow state)
□ Teach someone else (Feynman technique)

**Remember:** Learning how to learn is a meta-skill. The better you get at it, the faster you acquire everything else. In a survival scenario, this compounds exponentially.
