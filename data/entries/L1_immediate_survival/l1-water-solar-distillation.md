- Dig a hole 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep in a sunny location.
- Place a collection container in the center of the hole.
- Add green vegetation or contaminated water around the container (not in it).
- Cover the hole with clear plastic sheet, seal edges with soil/rocks.

warnings:
- Solar stills produce small amounts of water — supplement with other methods.
- Energy spent building may exceed water gained in some conditions.
- Plastic sheet is essential — no effective substitute exists.
