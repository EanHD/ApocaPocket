summary: 'Each environment kills you differently. Temperate forests are forgiving; deserts and arctic are brutal. This entry profiles major biomes: primary threats, water sources, shelter priorities, food
  availability, and common mistakes. Know your environment to prioritize correctly.'
warnings:
- Transitioning between biomes (mountain pass from forest to alpine) can catch you unprepared — weather changes in minutes
- 'Coastal areas seem abundant but have hidden dangers: tides, riptides, cold water even in summer'
- Tropical environments rot everything — gear, shelters, food — at 5× the rate of temperate climates
- Urban survival is its own category — avoid assumptions from wilderness survival
steps:
- 'TEMPERATE FOREST (easiest): Threats = hypothermia (wet + cold), getting lost. Water = abundant (streams, springs). Shelter = easy (natural materials, windbreaks). Food = moderate (forage, small game).
  Strategy: Shelter and fire first, then food. Biggest mistake: overconfidence leading to poor prep. Timeline: Survivable indefinitely with skill.'
- 'DESERT (extreme heat): Threats = dehydration (you can lose 1L/hour sweating), heat stroke, lack of shade. Water = scarce and precious. Shelter = shade structures, underground during day, insulated at
  night (deserts are COLD at night). Food = sparse (reptiles, insects, cacti). Strategy: Water is #1 always. Travel only dawn/dusk. Biggest mistake: walking in midday sun. Timeline: 24-48 hours without
  water = life-threatening.'
- 'ARCTIC/ALPINE (extreme cold): Threats = hypothermia, frostbite, wind chill, avalanche. Water = everywhere (snow/ice) but melting costs fuel/fire. Shelter = insulated (snow cave, debris, barrier from
  wind). Food = scarce (fish through ice, stored food critical). Strategy: Shelter + fire immediately. Stay dry (wet = death). Biggest mistake: sweating inside clothing (moisture freezes). Timeline: Hours
  to hypothermia in extreme conditions.'
- 'TROPICAL JUNGLE (heat + humidity): Threats = dehydration, infections, insect-borne disease, dangerous animals. Water = abundant but contaminated (parasites, bacteria). Shelter = waterproof and elevated
  (ground is wet, insects swarm). Food = abundant (fruit, fish, small game). Strategy: Boil ALL water. Stay dry (fungal infections). Biggest mistake: minor cuts becoming infected. Timeline: Infections can
  incapacitate in 48-72 hours.'
- 'COASTAL/MARINE: Threats = cold water immersion (even 15°C water = hypothermia in 1-2 hours), tides, storms. Water = abundant but undrinkable (seawater dehydrates you). Shelter = above high tide line,
  windbreak. Food = abundant (fish, shellfish, seaweed). Strategy: Fresh water is the constraint. Solar still, rain collection, or moving inland. Biggest mistake: drinking seawater or eating raw saltwater
  fish without fresh water (protein dehydration). Timeline: 3-5 days without fresh water.'
- 'PLAINS/GRASSLAND (exposure): Threats = sun exposure, wind, lightning, lack of natural shelter. Water = variable (rivers, ponds). Shelter = must be built (no natural materials). Food = moderate (game,
  wild grains). Strategy: Water first, then shelter from sun/wind. Fire is easy (dry grass tinder). Biggest mistake: camping in low areas (flash flood risk). Timeline: Manageable if water is present.'
- 'SWAMP/WETLAND (disease + discomfort): Threats = contaminated water, insects (disease vectors), hypothermia (wet + cool), difficult travel. Water = everywhere but dangerously contaminated. Shelter = raised
  platforms, avoiding standing water. Food = abundant (fish, waterfowl, plants). Strategy: Stay DRY, elevated, boil all water. Biggest mistake: wading through water (foot rot, leeches, parasites). Timeline:
  Infections and disease within days.'
- 'URBAN/COLLAPSED INFRASTRUCTURE: Threats = other humans (violence, disease), contaminated water, structural collapse, fire, no wild food. Water = stored in pipes (unsafe after days), rainwater, swimming
  pools (chlorinated). Shelter = existing structures (risk of collapse). Food = scavenging, urban foraging (parks, gardens). Strategy: Avoid people unless you know they''re safe. Water purification critical.
  Biggest mistake: trusting strangers in desperation. Timeline: Social collapse = days to weeks of relative safety.'

# Survival Environment Profiles — Threats & Priorities by Biome

Each environment kills you differently. Temperate forests are forgiving; deserts and arctic are brutal. This entry profiles major biomes: primary threats, water sources, shelter priorities, food availability, and common mistakes. Know your environment to prioritize correctly.
