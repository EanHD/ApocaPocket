# Apartment Fortification - Security Zones

## Overview

**In civil unrest, grid-down scenarios, or extended disasters, home security prevents theft, violence, and forced entry.** Apartments have unique vulnerabilities (shared walls, multiple access points, limited escape routes) but also advantages (elevation, fewer windows, smaller perimeter).

**Goal:** Create layered security that DELAYS intruders (not impenetrable fortress - that doesn't exist). Every 60 seconds of delay = higher chance they give up and move to easier target.

**Timeline:** Basic fortification in 2-4 hours with household items. Advanced reinforcement over 24-48 hours if time permits.

**Legal Note:** In normal times, fortification may violate lease agreements. In emergencies, survival trumps lease terms. Remove fortifications when normalcy returns.

---

## Security Layers (Defense in Depth)

```
LAYER 1: Building Perimeter (limited control)
         ↓
LAYER 2: Apartment Entry (door, locks)  ← PRIMARY FOCUS
         ↓
LAYER 3: Interior Barriers (safe room)
         ↓
LAYER 4: Escape Routes (if breach occurs)
```

**Philosophy:** You cannot control building perimeter (shared space), so focus on YOUR door and creating fallback positions inside.

---

## Layer 1: Building Perimeter Assessment

### Entry Points to Monitor

**Main entrance:**
- Does it lock? (buzzer system, key card)
- Can you secure it better? (wedge, additional lock)
- Visibility from your unit? (can you see who enters)

**Secondary entrances:**
- Fire exits (usually alarmed, but can be breached)
- Garage/parking (often unsecured, direct building access)
- Roof access (less common, but possible)

**Neighbor cooperation:**
- Can you organize building security (rotating watch, shared resources)?
- Identify trustworthy neighbors (mutual defense)
- Avoid advertising your supplies (opsec = operational security)

### Limited Fortification Options

**If you have control (small building, cooperative neighbors):**
- Barricade main entrance with furniture (couch, table, dresser stacked)
- Remove handle from outside (door only opens from inside)
- Post watch schedule (2-hour shifts, 24/7 coverage)

**If you DON'T have control (large building, hostile neighbors):**
- Assume building perimeter is breached
- Focus 100% on YOUR apartment door
- Plan escape route (fire escape, balcony)

---

## Layer 2: Apartment Door Fortification (PRIMARY DEFENSE)

### Door Assessment

**Your door is the critical chokepoint.** 90% of break-ins give up at a reinforced door.

**Check:**
- [ ] Door material: Solid core wood (good) or hollow core (weak - reinforce)
- [ ] Door frame: Solid wood or metal (good) or drywall/thin wood (weak - reinforce)
- [ ] Hinges: Interior (good) or exterior (can be removed - PIN THEM)
- [ ] Lock: Deadbolt (good) or just doorknob lock (inadequate)

---

### Reinforcement Priority Order

#### 1. Door Wedge / Door Stop (0-5 minutes, $5)

**Simplest, most effective first layer.**

**Method:**
- Rubber door wedge (buy 2-3, stack if needed)
- Jam under door from inside (as tight as possible)
- Test: Try pushing door from outside - should not budge

**Why it works:** Transfers force to floor (strongest point), not hinges/frame

**Upgrade:** Kickproof door brace (metal bar from doorknob to floor, $30-50)

---

#### 2. Deadbolt Reinforcement (10-20 minutes, $20-40)

**If you have a deadbolt:**
- Add strike plate reinforcement (metal plate, 3" screws into stud)
- Replace short screws (1") with 3" screws (penetrate door frame into wall stud)

**If you DON'T have a deadbolt:**
- Portable door lock (slides into door latch hole, $15-30)
- Security bar (like hotel doors have, $20)

**Key upgrade:** Door wrap-around strike plate (covers 12" of door frame, $25)

---

#### 3. Hinge Protection (15-30 minutes, $10)

**If hinges are on OUTSIDE (exterior doors sometimes):**
- Attacker can remove hinge pins, lift door off
- **FIX:** Install hinge pins or setscrew hinges (cannot be removed from outside)

**If hinges are on INSIDE (most apartments):**
- Already protected
- Optional: Add setscrew to hinge pin (prevents removal even from inside during struggle)

---

#### 4. Door Frame Reinforcement (30-60 minutes, $50-100)

**Problem:** Kicking door breaks FRAME (wood cracks around lock), not lock itself.

**Solution:** Door frame reinforcement kit
- Metal sleeve around door frame (both sides of deadbolt)
- 3" screws into wall studs
- Installation: Remove door trim, install sleeve, replace trim

**DIY alternative:**
- 2×4 lumber screwed to door frame (inside apartment)
- Less aesthetic, equally effective
- Paint to match wall (camouflage)

---

#### 5. Barricade System (2-4 hours, $50-200)

**For extended siege scenarios (riots, prolonged unrest).**

**Method A: Furniture Barricade**
- Heavy furniture (dresser, bookshelf, couch)
- Stack against door (weight = resistance)
- Secure to wall if possible (prevents toppling)
- Leave small gap (you need to peek through, talk to potential allies)

**Method B: 2×4 Cross Brace**
- Two 2×4 boards in "X" pattern across door
- Screwed into door frame on both sides
- Distributes force, prevents door flexing
- Removable (unscrew when needed)

**Method C: Floor-to-Ceiling Brace**
- 2×4 or pipe from floor to top of door frame
- Angled 45° (strong compression angle)
- Adjustable car jack or extendable rod
- **Most effective:** Cannot be defeated by kicking

---

### Window Security

**Ground floor / fire escape access:** High risk  
**Upper floors:** Lower risk (but not zero - fire escape, balcony)

#### Reinforcement Options

**1. Window Film (1-2 hours, $30-60 per window)**
- Security film (holds glass together when broken)
- Prevents easy entry (glass cracks but doesn't shatter)
- Application: Clean window, apply film, squeegee out bubbles
- 3M or Gila brands (4-8 mil thickness)

**2. Window Bars / Dowel Rods (15-30 minutes per window, $10)**
- Wood dowel or metal rod in window track (prevents opening)
- Cut to exact length (slightly longer than gap)
- Place in lower track (window cannot slide up/open)
- **Fire safety:** Keep one window WITHOUT bar (emergency exit)

**3. Window Coverings (blackout, concealment)**
- Heavy curtains or blankets (blocks light, prevents reconnaissance)
- Aluminum foil + duct tape (primitive but effective)
- **Why:** Outsiders cannot see supplies, movement, number of people

---

## Layer 3: Interior Safe Room

### Concept

**If door is breached, retreat to interior room.**

**Best room characteristics:**
- No windows (hallway, bathroom, walk-in closet)
- Solid door (can be reinforced same as entry door)
- Away from exterior walls (safer from gunfire)
- Water access if possible (bathroom ideal)

### Safe Room Setup

**Pre-stage supplies:**
- Water (1 gallon per person minimum)
- Food (energy bars, ready-to-eat)
- First aid kit
- Flashlight, batteries
- Phone (charged, call 911 if possible)
- Weapon (if you have one - last resort self-defense)
- Crowbar or tool (force exit if trapped)

**Reinforce safe room door:**
- Same techniques as entry door (wedge, deadbolt, barricade)
- Communication: Can you yell for help? Balcony access?

### Duration

**Goal:** Survive 15-30 minutes in safe room
- Intruders typically leave after 5-10 minutes (too risky to stay)
- Time for neighbors to call police (if phones work)
- Time for you to formulate escape plan

---

## Layer 4: Escape Routes

### Fire Escape (if you have one)

**Advantages:**
- Exterior descent (avoid interior danger)
- Access to ground level

**Disadvantages:**
- Exposed (visible to others)
- May be blocked or compromised

**Preparation:**
- Keep fire escape clear (no storage, plants, debris)
- Practice descent (in daytime, safe conditions)
- Rope or ladder (if fire escape is damaged or missing lower section)

### Balcony Escape

**Upper floors (2-4 stories):**
- **DO NOT JUMP** unless fire or imminent deadly threat
- Rope descent (25-50 ft rope, $30-50)
- Tie to balcony railing, rappel down
- Practice knot-tying (figure-8 follow-through, $20 climbing carabiner)

**Ground floor / 2nd floor:**
- Drop possible (8-12 ft = survivable)
- Technique: Hang from balcony edge, drop (reduces fall distance by 6 ft)
- Land on feet, roll sideways (parkour landing)

### Neighbor Balconies (side-to-side)

**If balconies are close (3-6 ft gap):**
- Wooden plank (2×10, 8 ft long)
- Bridge gap, crawl across
- **Test first** (weight-bearing, stability)
- Only in extreme emergency (high risk)

### Interior Hallway

**If apartment door breached but safe room holding:**
- Can you exit via different door (balcony door, bathroom window)?
- Can you signal neighbors (bang on walls, yell for help)?
- Do you have alternate escape (break through wall into adjacent unit if cooperative)?

---

## Noise & Light Discipline

### Noise

**Why it matters:** Quiet apartment = appears abandoned = less attractive target

**Techniques:**
- Whisper or write notes (no loud talking)
- Muffle sounds (blankets over windows, towels under doors)
- Avoid banging pots, moving furniture (sound travels through walls)
- No music, TV, radio (audible to outsiders)

**Exception:** If you're coordinating with neighbors or authorities, controlled noise is necessary (agreed-upon signals).

### Light

**Why it matters:** Light = occupied = potential supplies = target

**Techniques:**
- No lights visible from outside (especially at night)
- Blackout curtains, blankets, or aluminum foil on windows
- Use flashlight sparingly (red filter = less visible, preserves night vision)
- Candles only in interior rooms (no windows)

**Exception:** If you're signaling for rescue (SOS flashlight pattern, clearly communicating distress).

---

## Deception & Misdirection

### Appearing Abandoned (if you're bugging in)

**Exterior signs:**
- No movement visible through windows
- No trash outside door (suggests no occupancy)
- Dust/dirt on doorstep (wipe shoe prints, add thin layer of dust)

**Interior signs (if someone peers through window):**
- Minimal furniture visible
- No food on counters
- Overturned chair (looks ransacked already)

**Risk:** Someone might break in thinking it's empty. BUT, they're less likely to target if it looks already looted.

---

### Occupied and Defended (if you're deterring)

**Exterior signs:**
- Visible barricades (shows determination)
- "ARMED OCCUPANTS" sign (may deter, may attract)
- Dog barking sounds (recording on loop, or real dog)

**Risk:** Advertises that you have supplies worth defending. Use only if you're confident in your security and willing to show force.

**Middle Ground:** No overt signs, but clear signals if approached:
- Verbal warning through door ("We're armed, leave now")
- Visible light (flashlight shined at intruder)
- Sound of racking shotgun (universally understood)

---

## Communication Protocols

### Safe Knock / Password

**Establish with trusted neighbors BEFORE emergency:**
- Unique knock pattern (e.g., knock-knock-pause-knock-knock-knock)
- Verbal password ("Is anyone home?" / Response: "We're fine, thanks")

**Without pre-arrangement:**
- Verify identity through door peephole or door gap (chain lock)
- Ask questions only real neighbor would know ("What's your apartment number?" "What color is your door?")
- **NEVER OPEN DOOR** until 100% verified

### Radio Communication (if you have two-way radios)

**Frequency:** FRS/GMRS (Family Radio Service, no license needed)
- Channel 1-14 (pre-agree with neighbors)
- Low power (0.5W) = short range (building only)

**Code words:**
- "All clear" = no threats
- "Condition yellow" = suspicious activity
- "Condition red" = immediate threat

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Advertising supplies (talking about food, water) | Operational security - tell no one |
| Relying only on door lock | Multiple layers (wedge + deadbolt + barricade) |
| No escape plan | Pre-identify 2+ escape routes, practice |
| Turning on all lights at night | Blackout windows, interior lights only |
| Opening door to check | Use peephole or talk through door |
| Forgetting fire escape as threat vector | Secure fire escape window/door same as entry |
| Not coordinating with neighbors | Mutual defense is stronger than solo |
| Making noise (TV, music, arguments) | Noise discipline - appear abandoned |

---

## When to Abandon Apartment

**Evacuate if:**
- Fire in building (smoke, smell, visible flames)
- Structural damage (earthquake, explosion, cracks in walls)
- Confirmed threat approaching your floor (gunfire, shouting getting closer)
- Out of water (severe dehydration risk outweighs security risk)
- No help coming (authorities not responding, situation worsening)

**Bug-out procedure:**
1. Grab bug-out bag (pre-packed: water, food, first aid, ID, cash)
2. Check hallway (peephole, door crack, listen)
3. Move quickly but quietly (stairs not elevator)
4. Avoid main entrance if compromised (fire escape, back exit)
5. Rally point (pre-designated location if family separated)

---

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Force Continuum

**Verbal warning** → **Show of force** → **Physical defense** → **Lethal force (last resort)**

**Justified force (generally):**
- Imminent threat to life (attacker with weapon, violent entry)
- Reasonable belief of danger (broken door, aggressive threats)
- Proportional response (don't shoot someone stealing a can of beans)

**NOT justified:**
- Shooting fleeing intruder (self-defense stops when threat ends)
- Booby traps (illegal, harm first responders)
- Excessive force (beating unconscious attacker)

**Consult local laws** - self-defense laws vary (stand your ground vs duty to retreat).
