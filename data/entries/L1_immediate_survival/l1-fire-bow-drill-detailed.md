summary: The bow drill is the most reliable primitive friction fire method. Success depends on wood selection, proper dimensions, correct technique, and prepared tinder. Most failures come from wrong wood,
  wet materials, or insufficient speed/pressure.
warnings:
- 'Friction fire requires BONE-DRY wood — even slightly damp wood will produce smoke but no ember. Test: wood snaps cleanly, does not bend'
- This is physically demanding — expect 30-60 seconds of maximum effort. Rest and hydrate before attempting
- Resinous woods (pine, spruce, fir) generally do NOT work for friction fire — resin gums up instead of forming dust. Use for fireboard only if no alternative
- Practice this skill BEFORE you need it. Cold, hungry, and desperate is not when to learn bow drill
steps:
- 'WOOD SELECTION — Best pairings (spindle and fireboard should be same wood or similar hardness): Willow-on-willow (excellent), cottonwood-on-cottonwood (excellent), cedar-on-cedar (good), basswood-on-basswood
  (good), poplar-on-poplar (good). Spindle should be slightly harder than fireboard. Avoid hard woods (oak, maple, hickory) — they require extreme effort.'
- 'FIREBOARD: flat piece of dry wood, ~12 inches long, 3-4 inches wide, ½-¾ inch thick. Carve a small depression (socket) near one edge for the spindle. Cut a V-notch from the edge into the center of the
  depression — this collects hot dust to form the ember.'
- 'SPINDLE: straight, dry stick, thumb-width (¾ inch diameter), 12-18 inches long. Carve pointed end (top, goes in handhold) and blunt/rounded end (bottom, goes in fireboard). The blunt end creates more
  friction.'
- 'BOW: sturdy curved stick, arm-length (24-30 inches). String with paracord, bootlace, natural cordage, or twisted plant fiber. Tension should be tight enough that spindle doesn''t slip but loose enough
  to wrap spindle once.'
- 'HANDHOLD: hardwood piece, stone with depression, shell, or bone that fits in your palm. Lubricate the top socket with earwax, pine resin, or animal fat to reduce friction (you want friction only at the
  BOTTOM).'
- 'SETUP: kneel with one foot on the fireboard, pinning it. Place tinder bundle under the V-notch. Wrap bow string once around spindle. Set spindle in fireboard socket, press down with handhold.'
- 'TECHNIQUE: start with slow, full-length strokes to warm the wood. Increase speed and downward pressure gradually over 15-20 seconds. When thick smoke appears, increase to MAXIMUM speed and pressure for
  10-15 more seconds. You need consistent, full-length bow strokes — short jerky strokes won''t work.'
- 'EMBER: when you see a glowing coal forming in the V-notch dust pile, STOP. Do not disturb it. Gently lift the fireboard away. The ember should be smoking on its own — a self-sustaining dark red/brown
  coal.'
- 'TRANSFER: carefully tip the ember into your tinder bundle (dry grass, cattail fluff, cedar bark, birch bark — fine material in center, coarser outside). Gently fold tinder around the ember and blow with
  steady, gentle breaths. Increase blow intensity as it smokes more. It will burst into flame.'
- 'TROUBLESHOOTING: Black dust = too much pressure, not enough speed. No dust = not enough pressure. Dust but no ember = wood too damp, or notch too shallow. String slipping = tighten bow or add rosin/sap
  to string.'
