# Wickiup (Quick Dome Shelter) ⭐⭐⭐

**Level:** L1 (Basic)  
**Category:** Shelter  
**Difficulty:** Moderate (requires materials gathering)  
**Build Time:** 2-4 hours (semi-permanent)  
**Effectiveness:** EXCELLENT - weatherproof, insulated, durable

## Why This Is Underrated

Modern people think "survival shelter = lean-to or log cabin." Lean-tos are COLD (one open side, no insulation). Log cabins take 40+ hours to build. The wickiup is the **Goldilocks shelter** - warmer than a lean-to, faster than a cabin, sleeps 4-6 people, and stands up to wind and rain. Apache, Paiute, and other tribes used wickiups as **semi-permanent homes** (not emergency shelters) because they WORK.

**The truth:** A properly built wickiup is warmer than a modern tent, more durable than a tarp shelter, and can be built in an afternoon with zero modern tools.

## Historical Context

- **Age:** 10,000+ years (dome shelters found in Paleolithic sites globally)
- **Apache:** Primary dwelling (portable home moved seasonally)
- **Paiute:** Winter homes (withstood mountain snowstorms)
- **Great Basin tribes:** Used for centuries (proven design in harsh climate)
- **Wigwam confusion:** Wickiup (Southwest) vs wigwam (Eastern woodlands) - similar construction, different materials
- **Modern use:** Native Americans still build wickiups for ceremonies and teaching

**Historical durability:** Apache wickiups lasted 6-12 months with no maintenance (seasonal dwelling, not temporary).

## How It Works

### Design Principles
- **Dome shape:** Wind flows over curved surface (doesn't push in like flat walls)
- **Frame flexibility:** Bent saplings flex in wind (don't break)
- **Insulation layers:** Multiple layers of bark/grass/hides trap air (dead air = insulation)
- **Central fire:** Smoke hole at apex, fire in center (heats entire space evenly)
- **Ground seal:** Covering extends to ground (no drafts)

**Physics:** Dome is strongest shape (distributes weight evenly), smallest surface area per volume (less heat loss).

## Construction

### Site Selection
1. **Level ground:** Dome requires circular foundation (uneven = unstable frame)
2. **Drainage:** Slight slope or high ground (water runoff)
3. **Wind protection:** Behind hill, in grove of trees (not exposed ridge)
4. **Materials nearby:** Saplings, bark, grass within 100 yards (reduces labor)
5. **Water access:** Near stream or spring (but not IN floodplain)

### Materials Needed

#### Frame (20-30 saplings)
- **Length:** 8-12 feet (longer = larger wickiup)
- **Diameter:** 1-2" at base (flexible but strong)
- **Species:** Willow (best - very flexible), alder, young oak, hazel, maple
- **Green wood:** Fresh-cut (dry wood breaks when bent)

#### Covering (150-300 sq ft material)
- **Best:** Bark (birch, cedar, elm) - waterproof, insulating
- **Good:** Cattails, tule reeds, long grass (bundled)
- **Alternative:** Pine boughs, leafy branches, hides, canvas, tarps
- **Layering:** 3-4 layers minimum (more = warmer)

#### Lashing (50-100 feet)
- **Natural:** Inner bark strips, plant fiber cordage, rawhide
- **Modern:** Paracord, rope, wire

### Step-by-Step Build

#### 1. Mark Circle
- **Diameter:** 8-12 feet (8' = 2-3 people, 12' = 4-6 people)
- **Method:** Stake + string compass, or pace out circumference
- **Mark posts:** 20-30 marks around circle (where saplings will plant)

#### 2. Plant Saplings
- **Depth:** 6-12" deep (dig or pound with rock)
- **Spacing:** 12-18" apart (closer = stronger frame)
- **Angle:** Vertical at base (will bend inward)
- **Alternating sides:** Plant opposite pairs (creates arch)

#### 3. Bend and Tie
- **Method:** Bend sapling inward, tie to opposite sapling at apex (4-5 feet high)
- **Work around circle:** Bend and tie pairs (creates dome framework)
- **Final height:** 5-7 feet at center (tall enough to stand/crouch)
- **Check stability:** Push on frame (should flex, not break)

#### 4. Add Horizontal Hoops
- **Purpose:** Strengthens frame, provides attachment for covering
- **Method:** Weave flexible saplings horizontally around frame (like ribs)
- **Number:** 3-5 hoops (bottom, mid, top)
- **Lash at intersections:** Tie hoops to vertical frame poles

#### 5. Create Door Opening
- **Location:** Southeast (away from prevailing wind)
- **Size:** 2-3 feet wide, 4-5 feet tall (crawl-through)
- **Method:** Leave 2-3 frame poles unconnected at door (can spread for entry)
- **Door cover:** Hang hide or bark over opening (removable)

#### 6. Apply Covering (Bottom to Top)
- **Start at ground:** Lay bark, grass bundles, or hides (overlap like shingles)
- **Work upward:** Each layer overlaps previous (sheds water)
- **Lash to frame:** Tie covering to horizontal hoops (prevents wind lift)
- **Layers:** 3-4 layers minimum (more = better insulation, waterproofing)
- **Smoke hole:** Leave 12-18" opening at apex (smoke escape)

#### 7. Ground Seal
- **Method:** Bank soil around base (6-12" high)
- **Purpose:** Seals gap between covering and ground (blocks drafts)
- **Alternative:** Overlap covering onto ground, weight with stones

### Interior Setup
- **Fire pit:** Center of floor, 12-18" diameter, ringed with stones
- **Sleeping area:** Perimeter (feet toward fire, head toward wall)
- **Bedding:** Grass, pine boughs, hides (6-12" thick layer)
- **Storage:** Back of wickiup (away from door)

## Variants & Upgrades

### Cold Weather Modifications
- **Double wall:** Build inner dome 2-3 feet inside outer (air gap = insulation)
- **Extra layers:** 5-6 layers of covering (extreme insulation)
- **Reflector wall:** Stone or log behind fire (reflects heat outward)
- **Seal smoke hole:** Adjustable cover (close during extreme cold, open when fire lit)

### Rain Protection
- **Steep pitch:** Bend saplings more sharply at top (water sheds faster)
- **Waterproof layer:** Bark outer layer (overlapped like shingles)
- **Drainage trench:** Dig 6" trench around perimeter (diverts runoff)

### Semi-Permanent
- **Thicker posts:** Use 2-3" diameter poles (lasts 6-12 months)
- **Multiple layers:** Alternate bark + grass + bark (complex insulation)
- **Repair:** Replace covering annually (frame lasts multiple years)

## Advantages Over Other Shelters

### Vs. Lean-To
1. **Warmth:** Enclosed dome traps heat (lean-to open on one side = cold)
2. **Wind protection:** Dome sheds wind (lean-to channels wind through)
3. **Rain protection:** Complete coverage (lean-to front gets wet)
4. **Capacity:** Sleeps 4-6 (lean-to = 1-2)

### Vs. Log Cabin
1. **Build time:** 2-4 hours (cabin = 40+ hours)
2. **Tool requirements:** Can build with no tools (cabin requires axe minimum)
3. **Materials:** Flexible saplings (cabin requires large logs)
4. **Portability:** Can disassemble, move, rebuild (cabin = permanent)

### Vs. Modern Tent
1. **Durability:** Lasts months (tent = days to weeks in elements)
2. **Insulation:** Better than single-wall tent (multiple layer covering)
3. **Fire inside:** Can have fire for warmth (tent = condensation, fire hazard)
4. **Capacity:** Sleeps more per square foot (no standing height needed)

## Modern Applications

### Long-Term Survival
- **Semi-permanent base:** Weeks to months (while establishing sustainable camp)
- **Winter shelter:** Withstands snow load (dome shape sheds snow)
- **Group shelter:** Families, multiple survivors (shared warmth, resources)

### Primitive Skills Camps
- **Teaching shelter:** Build communal wickiup (group project)
- **Summer camp dwelling:** Comfortable, low-tech (connects people to history)

### Emergency Shelter
- **Alternative to tarp:** When no tarp available, wickiup uses natural materials
- **Injured party:** More comfortable than lean-to (can lie down, stay warm)

### Homesteading
- **Temporary housing:** While building permanent structure
- **Storage:** Cover goods, food, firewood (weatherproof)

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- **After storms:** Check frame integrity, re-tie loose saplings
- **Monthly:** Inspect covering (replace damaged sections)
- **Seasonal:** Replace covering (grass/bark degrades after 3-6 months)

### Repairs
- **Frame damage:** Remove broken sapling, insert new one, tie
- **Covering gaps:** Add new layer over gap (overlap existing covering)
- **Ground seal:** Re-bank soil after heavy rain (erosion creates gaps)

## Climate Adaptations

### Desert (Hot, Dry)
- **Shade first:** Focus on sun protection (heat more dangerous than cold)
- **Open weave:** Allow air circulation (ventilation prevents overheating)
- **Brush covering:** Ocotillo, mesquite branches (abundant, provides shade)

### Forest (Wet, Moderate)
- **Steep pitch:** Maximize water runoff
- **Thick bark:** Cedar, birch (waterproof layers)
- **Elevated floor:** Build on platforms logs (keeps bedding dry)

### Mountains (Cold, Windy)
- **Low profile:** 4-5 feet high (less wind exposure)
- **Double wall:** Extra insulation layer
- **Small door:** Minimize heat loss (crawl-through only)

## Safety Considerations

### Fire Hazard
- **Risk:** Dry grass/bark covering = highly flammable
- **Mitigation:** Keep fire small (12-18" diameter), use green wood (less sparks), attend fire constantly
- **Smoke hole size:** Large enough for smoke (prevents buildup inside)

### Carbon Monoxide
- **Risk:** Enclosed space + fire = CO buildup
- **Mitigation:** Adequate ventilation (smoke hole + door crack), never seal completely
- **Symptoms:** Headache, dizziness, nausea (EXIT immediately if symptoms occur)

### Structural Collapse
- **Risk:** Heavy snow, wind, or poor construction = collapse
- **Mitigation:** Strong frame (1-2" saplings), multiple horizontal hoops, snow shedding design

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Frame collapses during construction
- **Cause:** Saplings too thin, too dry (brittle), or planted too shallow
- **Fix:** Use thicker saplings (1.5-2"), fresh-cut only, plant 12" deep

### Problem: Smoke doesn't exit (fills interior)
- **Cause:** Smoke hole too small, wind blowing down, or fire too smoky (wet wood)
- **Fix:** Enlarge smoke hole to 18-24", adjust fire location, use dry wood

### Problem: Rain leaks through covering
- **Cause:** Insufficient layers, gaps in coverage, or improper overlap
- **Fix:** Add 1-2 more layers, check for gaps (fill with grass), ensure shingle overlap

### Problem: Cold drafts at ground level
- **Cause:** Gap between covering and ground
- **Fix:** Bank soil around perimeter (6-12" high), extend covering to ground, weight with stones

## Legal Considerations

### Public Land
- **National Forests:** Typically allowed with limits (14-day max stay, no damage to live trees)
- **BLM Land:** Generally allowed (check local regulations)
- **National Parks:** Prohibited (no gathering materials, no structures)
- **State Parks:** Varies (most prohibit structures)

### Private Property
- **Owner permission required:** Even for temporary structures
- **Liability:** Landowner may be liable for injuries (get written permission)

### Building Codes
- **Rural areas:** Usually exempt (temporary structures under code threshold)
- **Urban areas:** May require permits (even temporary structures)

## Final Notes

The wickiup is not an "emergency shelter" - it's a **legitimate home**. Apache families lived in wickiups year-round, through summer heat and winter cold. The design works because it's **engineered**, not improvised.

In a survival scenario lasting more than a few days, skip the lean-to and build a wickiup. It takes 2-4 hours, but it'll keep you warm and dry for months. That's not wasted time - that's investment in survival.

**Historical perspective:** If Native Americans chose wickiups over tipis, log cabins, and adobe houses in certain regions, it's because wickiups were the **best option** for that environment. The design is proven. Don't underestimate a "bent stick hut."
