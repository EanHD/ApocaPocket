# Nasopharyngeal Airway (NPA) - Insertion and Airway Management

## Overview

A **nasopharyngeal airway (NPA)**, also called nasal trumpet, is a soft rubber or plastic tube inserted through the nose to maintain an open airway in patients with:
- Decreased level of consciousness (but not deeply unconscious)
- Airway obstruction from tongue falling back
- Need for repeated suctioning

**Advantages over oropharyngeal airway (OPA):**
- Better tolerated (less gag reflex stimulation)
- Can use in semi-conscious patients (OPA requires deeply unconscious patient)
- Can use in patients with clenched jaw (trismus)
- Can use when oral trauma prevents OPA insertion

**When NPA is needed:**
- Unconscious or semi-conscious patient with airway compromise
- Snoring respirations (indicates tongue obstructing airway)
- Need for nasotracheal suctioning
- Patient cannot maintain own airway but has intact gag reflex

**This entry covers:**
- Indications and contraindications
- Sizing technique (nose-to-earlobe measurement)
- Step-by-step insertion
- Complications and management
- When to upgrade to advanced airway

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS ⚠️

**ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATIONS (NEVER USE NPA):**

1. **Suspected skull fracture:**
   - Basilar skull fracture (fracture at base of skull)
   - Cribriform plate fracture (roof of nasal cavity)
   - **Risk:** NPA can penetrate through fracture into brain (fatal)
   - **Signs of basilar skull fracture:**
     - Battle's sign (bruising behind ear)
     - Raccoon eyes (bruising around both eyes)
     - CSF leak from nose (clear fluid dripping - cerebrospinal fluid)
     - CSF leak from ear (clear fluid from ear canal)
     - Severe facial trauma with midface instability

2. **Severe facial trauma:**
   - LeFort fractures (midface fractures)
   - Nasal fractures (relative contraindication - may still attempt if no skull fracture)

**If skull fracture suspected, use oropharyngeal airway (OPA) or jaw-thrust only. If patient needs advanced airway, use oral intubation (NOT nasal).**

---

## Anatomy

### Nasal Passage

**Pathway:**
- Nostril (anterior nares) → Nasal cavity → Nasopharynx (behind nose) → Oropharynx (behind mouth)

**Structures:**
- **Turbinates:** Bony projections from lateral nasal wall (inferior, middle, superior)
  - Covered with mucosa (delicate, vascular - bleeds easily)
  - NPA passes BELOW inferior turbinate along floor of nose
- **Septum:** Divides nose into left and right chambers
  - Often deviated (one side larger than other)
  - Choose larger nostril for NPA insertion
- **Cribriform plate:** Thin bone at roof of nasal cavity (part of skull base)
  - Perforated (olfactory nerves pass through)
  - Easily fractured in head trauma
  - **Reason NPA contraindicated in skull fracture**

### Nasopharynx

- Space behind nose, above soft palate
- Connects to oropharynx (back of throat)
- NPA tip sits in nasopharynx, above base of tongue
- Relieves airway obstruction by keeping tongue forward

---

## Indications for NPA

**Use NPA when patient has:**

1. **Decreased level of consciousness** (but not deeply unconscious)
   - GCS 9-13 (moderate impairment)
   - Responds to verbal or painful stimuli
   - Able to protect airway somewhat but tongue falling back

2. **Intact or hyperactive gag reflex** (makes OPA impossible)
   - OPA triggers gagging, vomiting, laryngospasm
   - NPA bypasses most sensitive gag reflex areas

3. **Trismus** (clenched jaw, lockjaw)
   - Cannot open mouth to insert OPA
   - Trauma, seizure, medication side effect

4. **Oral trauma**
   - Facial injuries, dental injuries preventing OPA
   - Intact nasal passage

5. **Need for nasotracheal suctioning**
   - Frequent airway clearance needed
   - NPA provides conduit for suction catheter

### NPA vs. OPA: When to Use Which

| Feature | NPA | OPA |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Consciousness level** | Semi-conscious (GCS 9-13) | Deeply unconscious (GCS ≤8) |
| **Gag reflex** | Intact or hyperactive | Absent (no gag reflex) |
| **Jaw** | Can use with clenched jaw | Requires ability to open mouth |
| **Contraindications** | Skull fracture, severe facial trauma, coagulopathy | Conscious patient, intact gag reflex, oral trauma |
| **Tolerance** | Well-tolerated | Poorly tolerated if gag present |
| **Effectiveness** | Less effective if deeply unconscious | More effective for deeply unconscious |

---

## Equipment

**Nasopharyngeal Airway:**
- Soft rubber or plastic tube
- Flanged end (prevents tube from going too far into nose)
- Hollow (allows air passage, suctioning)
- Beveled tip (smooth insertion)
- Sizes: 6mm - 9mm internal diameter (ID)
  - 6.0-6.5mm: Small adult, adolescent
  - 7.0-7.5mm: Average adult female
  - 8.0-8.5mm: Average adult male
  - 9.0mm: Large adult male

**Additional supplies:**
- Water-soluble lubricant (K-Y Jelly, Surgilube) OR water (if no lubricant)
- Gloves
- Suction (if available)
- Gauze or tape (to secure)

**Alternative sizing guide:**
- Use patient's "pinky finger" diameter as rough guide
- NPA should fit through nostril without excessive force

---

## Sizing the NPA

**Critical:** Proper sizing prevents trauma and ensures effective airway.

### Nose-to-Earlobe Measurement (Standard Method)

**Technique:**
1. Hold NPA against side of patient's face
2. Place flanged end at nostril opening
3. Extend NPA along nose toward ear
4. Tip of NPA should reach **earlobe** (lobule)

**Length guide:**
- Adult: ~6-7 inches (15-18 cm)
- Adolescent: ~5-6 inches (12-15 cm)
- Child: Varies (rarely use NPA in children - OPA preferred)

**Diameter selection:**
- Choose largest diameter that fits comfortably through nostril
- Too small: Ineffective (doesn't relieve obstruction)
- Too large: Trauma, bleeding, won't advance

**Which nostril to use:**
- Inspect both nostrils (look for obstruction, bleeding, deviated septum)
- Choose larger, less obstructed nostril
- Right nostril often preferred (more direct path in most patients)
- If one fails, try other nostril

---

## Step-by-Step Insertion Technique

### 1. Preparation (30 seconds)

**Scene safety:**
- Gloves (universal precautions)
- Suction ready (if available)

**Patient positioning:**
- **Supine** (flat on back) with head in neutral position
- If spinal injury suspected: Maintain c-spine immobilization (jaw-thrust only, no head tilt)
- If no spinal injury AND patient breathing: Can tilt head slightly back (sniffing position)

**Equipment:**
- Select appropriately sized NPA (nose-to-earlobe measurement)
- Lubricate NPA generously (entire tube, especially tip)
  - Water-soluble lubricant preferred
  - If no lubricant: Use water or saline (DO NOT insert dry)
  - Lidocaine jelly (if available) - provides lubrication + local anesthesia (reduces discomfort)

### 2. Insertion (10-20 seconds)

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Inspect nostril:**
   - Look for obvious obstruction (polyps, foreign body, blood clots)
   - Clear visible obstruction if safe

2. **Hold NPA correctly:**
   - Grasp NPA near flanged end
   - **Bevel faces septum** (opening toward midline/septum, NOT toward turbinates)
     - Reduces trauma to turbinates
     - Some sources say bevel away from septum - either acceptable, but toward septum more common

3. **Insert gently:**
   - Align NPA parallel to floor of mouth (NOT angled upward toward forehead)
     - Common mistake: Angling upward (hits roof of nose, causes trauma)
     - Correct angle: Straight back toward occiput (back of head)
   - Apply gentle, steady pressure
   - Advance with slight twisting motion (helps navigate curves)

4. **Resistance:**
   - **Gentle resistance normal** (navigating turbinates, nasopharyngeal curve)
   - **Firm resistance:** STOP
     - Do NOT force (can perforate)
     - Try other nostril OR smaller NPA

5. **Advance until flanged end reaches nostril:**
   - Flange rests against nostril opening (prevents tube from going deeper)
   - Tip of NPA now in nasopharynx (behind soft palate, above tongue base)

### 3. Confirm Placement (5-10 seconds)

**Check:**
1. **Air movement:**
   - Feel for air coming out of NPA during exhalation (place hand near opening)
   - Listen for breath sounds through NPA (place ear near opening)

2. **Patient tolerance:**
   - Minimal coughing/gagging (NPA should be well-tolerated)
   - If patient coughs, gags violently, or becomes combative → May be too long or patient more conscious than thought

3. **Breathing improved:**
   - Less snoring (indicates tongue obstruction relieved)
   - More regular respiratory rate
   - Improved oxygen saturation (if pulse oximeter available)

4. **No bleeding:**
   - Small amount of blood normal (nasal mucosa very vascular)
   - Moderate to severe bleeding → See complications below

### 4. Secure (1 minute)

**Taping:**
- Tape NPA flange to nose or cheek (prevents accidental dislodgement)
- Use medical tape or adhesive (NOT circumferential taping around head - can increase intracranial pressure if head injury)

**Safety pin method (alternative):**
- Insert safety pin through flange (creates larger stopper)
- Tape safety pin to face

---

## Post-Insertion Management

### Monitoring (Continuous)

**Assess every 5-15 minutes:**
- [ ] **Airway patency:** Air moving through NPA
- [ ] **Breathing:** Rate, depth, effort, oxygen saturation
- [ ] **Level of consciousness:** Improving (good), worsening (bad - may need advanced airway)
- [ ] **Bleeding:** Check for blood around NPA or dripping from nose
- [ ] **Position:** NPA still in place (flange visible at nostril)

**If patient becomes more alert:**
- Patient may push out NPA (becoming conscious enough to protect own airway - good sign)
- Allow patient to remove if fully conscious and breathing normally

**If patient becomes less responsive:**
- May need advanced airway (endotracheal intubation)
- Suction as needed (through NPA if secretions)

### Suctioning Through NPA

**When needed:**
- Secretions audible (gurgling, wet breathing)
- Decreased oxygen saturation
- Respiratory distress

**Technique:**
1. Measure suction catheter: Catheter length should equal NPA length + 2 inches
2. Pre-oxygenate if possible (high-flow oxygen for 30 seconds)
3. Insert catheter through NPA WITHOUT suctioning (suction OFF)
4. Advance to end of NPA (do NOT force past NPA tip into trachea)
5. Apply suction while WITHDRAWING catheter (not while advancing)
6. Suction for max 10-15 seconds (causes hypoxia if too long)
7. Re-oxygenate between suction attempts

---

## Complications and Management

### 1. Epistaxis (Nosebleed)

**Most common complication** (10-30% of insertions)

**Prevention:**
- Adequate lubrication
- Gentle insertion (no forcing)
- Correct angle (parallel to floor of mouth, not upward)
- Appropriate size (not too large)

**Management if occurs:**

**Minor bleeding (small amount of blood at nostril):**
- Normal, self-limited
- Continue monitoring
- No intervention needed

**Moderate bleeding (steady drip):**
1. Leave NPA in place (removal may worsen bleeding)
2. Apply direct pressure: Pinch soft part of nose (below nasal bones) for 10 minutes
3. Lean patient forward (prevents blood going down throat → vomiting)
4. Ice pack to bridge of nose (vasoconstriction)
5. Usually stops within 10-15 minutes

**Severe bleeding (brisk flow, not stopping with pressure):**
1. Consider removing NPA (if bleeding clearly from NPA trauma)
2. Anterior nasal packing (if trained):
   - Insert ribbon gauze or hemostatic gauze (QuikClot)
   - Pack tightly from front to back
3. Seek medical care (may need posterior nasal packing or cauterization)

### 2. Vomiting/Aspiration

**Risk:** NPA can stimulate gag reflex (less than OPA, but still possible)

**Prevention:**
- Proper sizing (not too long)
- Slow, gentle insertion

**Management if vomiting:**
1. **Turn patient on side** (recovery position) - allows vomit to drain, prevents aspiration
2. **Suction** oropharynx (if available)
3. **Do NOT remove NPA immediately** (may still need airway support after vomiting)
4. **Reassess:** Once vomiting stops, check airway, breathing, consciousness level

**If aspiration occurs:**
- Suction aggressively
- High-flow oxygen
- Monitor for respiratory distress (aspiration pneumonia develops over hours-days)
- Antibiotics if prolonged (see antibiotic guide - cover oral flora)

### 3. Laryngospasm

**Rare but life-threatening:** Vocal cords spasm shut (complete airway obstruction)

**Trigger:** NPA too long (tip touches epiglottis or vocal cords)

**Signs:**
- Sudden inability to breathe (no air movement)
- Stridor (high-pitched sound) or complete silence
- Severe respiratory distress (accessory muscle use, cyanosis)

**Management:**
1. **Remove NPA immediately** (remove stimulus)
2. **100% oxygen** via bag-valve mask (high flow, positive pressure)
3. **Jaw thrust** (pulls tongue forward, opens airway)
4. **Suction** if secretions
5. **Positive pressure ventilation** may break spasm (force air past cords)
6. **If no improvement:** Prepare for advanced airway (intubation or surgical airway)

### 4. Kinking/Obstruction of NPA

**Cause:** NPA bends within nasal passage (soft material can kink)

**Signs:**
- Increased work of breathing despite NPA in place
- No air movement through NPA
- Patient deteriorating

**Management:**
1. Check for obstruction (blood clot, secretions blocking NPA lumen)
2. Suction through NPA (may clear obstruction)
3. If kinked: Remove and replace with stiffer NPA or OPA (if patient deeply unconscious)

### 5. Intracranial Placement (CATASTROPHIC)

**Cause:** NPA inserted through skull fracture (cribriform plate, basilar skull fracture)

**Prevention:** **NEVER use NPA if skull fracture suspected** (see contraindications)

**Signs (if occurs):**
- Clear fluid (CSF) from nose
- Severe bleeding
- Sudden neurological deterioration (loss of consciousness, seizure, posturing)

**Management:**
1. Remove NPA immediately
2. Neurosurgical emergency (immediate evacuation)
3. Supportive care (airway via OPA or advanced airway, manage bleeding, monitor neuro status)

---

## Removing the NPA

**When to remove:**
- Patient fully conscious (GCS 15)
- Patient able to protect own airway (coughs, swallows, speaks normally)
- Patient requests removal
- Need to replace with advanced airway (endotracheal tube)
- Severe uncontrolled bleeding

**Removal technique:**
1. Explain to patient (if conscious)
2. Remove tape/securing device
3. **Grasp flange** and pull straight out (smooth, steady motion)
4. Inspect NPA (ensure intact - no pieces left behind)
5. Suction nose/oropharynx if needed
6. Monitor patient (can they maintain own airway?)

**After removal:**
- Some minor bleeding common
- Instruct patient to breathe through mouth initially (nasal passage swollen)
- Monitor for airway compromise (may need to reinsert)

---

## NPA in Special Populations

### Children

**Generally avoid NPA in children** (OPA preferred)

**Reasons:**
- Smaller nasal passages (higher trauma risk)
- Adenoids (can obstruct NPA placement or cause bleeding)
- Less cooperative (difficult to size, insert)

**If NPA needed in child:**
- Size: Smaller than adult (5.0-6.5mm typical)
- Measurement: Same (nose-to-earlobe)
- Technique: Same, but EXTRA gentle

### Patients on Blood Thinners (Anticoagulation)

**Risk:** Increased bleeding (epistaxis harder to control)

**Considerations:**
- Still use NPA if needed (airway takes priority)
- Be extra gentle
- Prepare for potential bleeding (suction, gauze, pressure)
- Consider OPA as alternative (if patient deeply unconscious)

### Trauma Patients

**Priorities:**
1. **Assess for skull fracture FIRST** (contraindication)
2. **Spinal precautions** (if mechanism suggests spine injury)
   - Maintain c-spine immobilization during NPA insertion
   - Jaw-thrust instead of head-tilt
3. **Facial trauma:**
   - Inspect nasal passages (fractured nose may still allow NPA, but higher risk)
   - Severe midface trauma = contraindication

---

## Advanced Airway Considerations

### When NPA is Insufficient

**NPA is temporizing measure.** Patient may need advanced airway if:
- Deeply unconscious (GCS ≤8)
- Apneic (not breathing)
- Inadequate oxygenation despite NPA + oxygen
- Airway protection needed (aspiration risk, vomiting)
- Prolonged transport (>30 minutes) with decreased consciousness

**Advanced airway options:**
- **Endotracheal intubation** (gold standard - requires training, equipment)
- **Supraglottic airway** (LMA, King LT - easier than intubation)
- **Surgical airway** (cricothyrotomy - last resort if cannot intubate)

### NPA with Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) Ventilation

**If patient has inadequate breathing (respiratory failure):**
1. Insert NPA (maintains airway patency)
2. Apply BVM over mouth AND nose (seal both)
3. Ventilate (squeeze bag) with jaw-thrust
   - Rate: 10-12 breaths/minute (adults), 12-20 breaths/minute (children)
   - Volume: Enough to see chest rise (don't overinflate - causes gastric distension)

**NPA improves BVM effectiveness:**
- Prevents tongue obstruction
- Allows ventilation even if mouth clenched (air goes through NPA)

---

## Field/Austere Considerations

### Improvised NPA

**If commercial NPA unavailable:**

**DO NOT IMPROVISE** - high risk of trauma, infection, complications

**If absolutely necessary (life-threatening airway obstruction, no other option):**
- Use soft rubber tubing (NOT rigid plastic)
- Diameter: ~8-10mm (size of pinky finger)
- Length: Measure nose-to-earlobe, cut tubing
- Lubricate heavily
- Insert VERY gently (higher risk without beveled tip, flange)

**Safer alternatives:**
- Jaw-thrust maneuver (no equipment needed)
- Recovery position (side-lying - gravity pulls tongue forward)
- OPA (if patient deeply unconscious, available)

### Prolonged Field Care

**If NPA in place >24 hours:**
- Remove and clean NPA every 24 hours (prevents crusting, infection)
- Alternate nostrils if possible (reduces trauma to one side)
- Keep lubricated (prevents mucosal drying, adhesion)
- Monitor for sinusitis (fever, facial pain) - NPA blocks sinus drainage

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Using NPA with suspected skull fracture | Check for signs of basilar skull fracture FIRST (Battle's sign, raccoon eyes, CSF leak) - if present, use OPA only |
| Angling NPA upward toward forehead | Insert parallel to floor of mouth (straight back toward occiput) |
| Forcing NPA past resistance | Gentle pressure only - if firm resistance, try other nostril or smaller size |
| Inadequate lubrication | Lubricate entire tube generously (water-soluble lubricant or water) |
| Wrong size (too short or too long) | Measure nose-to-earlobe every time (patients vary) |
| Using NPA in fully conscious patient | NPA for semi-conscious only (GCS 9-13) - conscious patient will not tolerate |
| Removing NPA during active vomiting | Turn patient on side FIRST (allows drainage), then reassess need for NPA |
| Using rigid tube for improvised NPA | Soft, flexible material only (rigid tube can perforate) |

---

## Summary: NPA vs. Other Airway Adjuncts

| Method | Consciousness Level | Equipment | Skill | Effectiveness |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Jaw-thrust/Head-tilt** | Any | None | Basic | Moderate (temporary) |
| **NPA** | Semi-conscious (GCS 9-13) | NPA, lube | Basic-Intermediate | Good (temporizing) |
| **OPA** | Deeply unconscious (GCS ≤8) | OPA | Basic | Good (temporizing) |
| **Supraglottic airway (LMA, King)** | Deeply unconscious | Device | Intermediate | Very good |
| **Endotracheal intubation** | Deeply unconscious | Laryngoscope, tube, meds | Advanced | Excellent (definitive) |
| **Surgical airway** | Any (if cannot intubate) | Scalpel, tube | Advanced | Excellent (definitive, last resort) |
