# Diabetes Emergency Management

## Overview

Diabetes affects 37 million Americans (11% of population). In survival scenarios, insulin-dependent diabetics face life-threatening emergencies from blood sugar extremes. **This entry could save lives.**

**CRITICAL:** Diabetic emergencies can progress from symptoms to coma/death in hours. Early recognition and treatment are essential.

## Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) - IMMEDIATE DANGER

### Recognition
**Symptoms by severity:**

| Stage | Blood Sugar | Symptoms | Time to Treat |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|
| Mild | 55-70 mg/dL | Shakiness, sweating, hunger, anxiety | 15 minutes |
| Moderate | 40-55 mg/dL | Confusion, blurred vision, difficulty speaking | 5-10 minutes |
| Severe | <40 mg/dL | Seizures, unconsciousness, coma | IMMEDIATE |

**Early warning signs:**
- Shakiness, trembling hands
- Cold sweat (especially forehead, neck)
- Rapid heartbeat
- Intense hunger
- Irritability, confusion
- Pale skin

### Treatment Protocol

**The "Rule of 15":**
1. **Give 15 grams fast-acting carbs** (choose one):
   - 4 glucose tablets (4g each)
   - ½ cup (4 oz) fruit juice
   - 1 tablespoon honey or sugar
   - 5-6 hard candies
2. **Wait 15 minutes**
3. **Recheck symptoms**
4. **If no improvement:** Repeat 15g carbs
5. **If improved:** Give complex carbs (bread, crackers) to stabilize

**Severe hypoglycemia (unconscious):**
- **Do NOT** give food/drink by mouth (choking risk)
- **If glucagon available:** Inject 1mg IM (intramuscular) into thigh
- **Recovery position** (on side) to prevent aspiration
- **Call for help immediately** - they may seize or aspirate

⚠️ **SAFETY WARNING:** Untreated severe hypoglycemia can cause brain damage in 30-60 minutes, death within 2-3 hours.

## Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar) - SLOWER BUT DANGEROUS

### Recognition
**Symptoms (develop over hours to days):**

| Blood Sugar | Symptoms | Danger Level |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 180-250 mg/dL | Thirst, frequent urination, fatigue | Monitor |
| 250-400 mg/dL | Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fruity breath | Concerning |
| >400 mg/dL | Confusion, rapid breathing, altered consciousness | Emergency |

**Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - Type 1 Emergency:**
- **Fruity/acetone breath** (smells like nail polish remover)
- **Kussmaul breathing** (rapid, deep breaths)
- **Severe dehydration** (dry mouth, sunken eyes, low urine output)
- **Abdominal pain** (may mimic appendicitis)
- **Altered mental status** (confusion → drowsiness → coma)

### Treatment Protocol

**Mild hyperglycemia (180-250 mg/dL):**
1. **Hydrate:** Drink 8 oz water every hour
2. **Light exercise** (if able): 15-minute walk
3. **Avoid additional carbs**
4. **Monitor closely** (check symptoms every 2-4 hours)

**Moderate to severe (>250 mg/dL or symptoms present):**
1. **Aggressive hydration:** 16-32 oz water per hour
2. **Insulin if available:**
   - Type 1: Give correction dose per sliding scale
   - Type 2: Extra oral medication dose if prescribed
3. **Monitor ketones** (urine strips if available)
4. **NO exercise** (makes DKA worse)

**DKA treatment (if medical care unavailable - VERY RISKY):**
1. **Fluids:** 1-2 liters water in first hour, then 500mL/hr
2. **Insulin:**
   - IV access: 0.1 units/kg/hr continuous
   - IM injection: 0.15 units/kg, then 0.1 units/kg/hr
3. **Electrolytes:** Add salt to water (1/4 tsp per liter)
4. **Evacuate urgently** - DKA has 5-10% mortality even with treatment

⚠️ **SAFETY WARNING:** DKA can be fatal within 24-48 hours without proper treatment. Evacuation is critical.

## Insulin Storage Without Refrigeration

**Storage timeline:**
- **Unopened vials:** Can last 28 days at room temp (59-86°F / 15-30°C)
- **Opened vials:** Use within 28 days at room temp
- **Extreme heat (>86°F):** Insulin degrades faster, use within 14 days
- **Freezing (<32°F):** Destroys insulin, DO NOT USE frozen insulin

**Storage methods:**
1. **Evaporative cooling:**
   - Wrap vial in wet cloth in shade
   - Maintain 60-70°F / 15-21°C
2. **Zeer pot (clay pot cooler):**
   - Nest small pot in larger pot, fill gap with sand, pour water on sand
   - Evaporation cools inner pot to 50-60°F / 10-15°C
3. **Underground storage:**
   - Bury in waterproof container 2-3 feet deep
   - Maintains 50-60°F / 10-15°C year-round
4. **Avoid:**
   - Direct sunlight (degrades in hours)
   - Car glove box (can hit 120°F / 49°C+)
   - Metal containers (conduct heat)

**Testing insulin quality:**
- **Visual check:** Should be clear (or uniformly cloudy for NPH)
- **Clumping, crystals, discoloration:** DISCARD
- **Smell:** Should be odorless or faint insulin smell
- **When in doubt:** Use it (degraded insulin is better than none)

## Emergency Glucose Sources (No Glucometer)

**High-sugar foods (15g carbs):**
- Honey: 1 tablespoon (20g)
- White sugar: 1 tablespoon (12g)
- Maple syrup: 1 tablespoon (13g)
- Raisins: 2 tablespoons (15g)
- Orange juice: ½ cup (13g)
- Regular soda: 4-6 oz (15g)

**Foraging glucose sources:**
- Maple sap (spring): 2% sugar, boil to concentrate
- Birch sap (spring): 1% sugar, drink fresh
- Wild honey: Highest concentration (15-20g per tablespoon)
- Fruit: Apples, berries (10-15g per cup)

## Type 1 vs Type 2 Differences

| Aspect | Type 1 | Type 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Insulin production** | None (pancreas destroyed) | Reduced or ineffective |
| **Insulin dependency** | ALWAYS required | May not need insulin |
| **Hypo risk** | High (from insulin) | Lower (unless on insulin) |
| **DKA risk** | High (lack of insulin) | Lower (some insulin present) |
| **Survival without insulin** | Days to weeks (fatal) | Months to years (complications) |
| **Emergency priority** | EXTREME - insulin is life | HIGH - but more flexible |

---

## Medication Rationing (If Supply Limited)

**Type 1 (insulin-dependent) - CRITICAL:**
- **Minimum dose:** 0.3-0.5 units/kg/day (survival minimum)
- **Example:** 150 lb (70 kg) person needs 21-35 units/day minimum
- **Rationing strategy:**
  - Focus on basal (long-acting) insulin first (0.2-0.3 units/kg/day)
  - Ration bolus (fast-acting) for high-carb meals
  - Reduce carb intake to 50-100g/day to minimize bolus needs
  - Accept higher blood sugars (180-250 mg/dL) temporarily

**Type 2 (oral medications):**
- **Metformin:** Can skip doses, focus on diet control
- **Sulfonylureas (glyburide, glipizide):** Reduce dose to avoid hypos
- **If insulin:** Ration as above, but Type 2s can often survive without

⚠️ **WARNING:** Rationing insulin for Type 1 is EXTREMELY dangerous. Blood sugars will run high (250-400+ mg/dL), leading to DKA risk, dehydration, and long-term complications.

## Monitoring Without Glucometer

**Symptom-based assessment:**

| Blood Sugar Range | Physical Signs |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **<70 mg/dL (low)** | Shakiness, sweating, rapid heart, confusion |
| **70-180 mg/dL (normal)** | Feel normal, stable energy |
| **180-250 mg/dL (mild high)** | Thirst, frequent urination, fatigue |
| **250-400 mg/dL (high)** | Very thirsty, nausea, fruity breath |
| **>400 mg/dL (extreme)** | Confusion, rapid breathing, altered consciousness |

**Urine testing (if strips available):**
- **Glucose in urine:** Blood sugar >180 mg/dL (kidneys spill excess)
- **Ketones in urine:** DKA warning, test if blood sugar >250 mg/dL

---

## Exercise & Activity Impact

**Exercise lowers blood sugar:**
- **Moderate activity:** Drops 20-40 mg/dL per 30 minutes
- **Intense activity:** Drops 40-80 mg/dL per 30 minutes
- **Timing:** Effect lasts 2-24 hours after exercise

**Pre-exercise protocol:**
1. **Check blood sugar** (or assess symptoms)
2. **If <100 mg/dL:** Eat 15-30g carbs before activity
3. **If 100-250 mg/dL:** Safe to exercise
4. **If >250 mg/dL + ketones:** DO NOT exercise (makes DKA worse)

**During/after exercise:**
- Have fast-acting carbs accessible (glucose tabs, candy)
- Watch for delayed hypoglycemia (up to 24 hours later)
- Reduce insulin dose after exercise (if able to adjust)

---

## Evacuation Considerations

**Evacuate immediately if:**
- Severe hypoglycemia (unconscious, seizing) and no glucagon
- DKA symptoms (fruity breath, confusion, vomiting, rapid breathing)
- Blood sugar >400 mg/dL with confusion/altered consciousness
- Ran out of insulin (Type 1) with blood sugar climbing
- Unable to keep fluids down (vomiting)

**Prepare for evacuation:**
- Carry 3-7 day insulin supply + syringes
- Backup glucose sources (honey, candy, juice)
- Medical ID (bracelet or card with "Type 1 Diabetes" or "Type 2 Diabetes")
- Emergency contact info
- Glucagon kit (if available)

---

## Prevention & Long-Term Management

**Preventing emergencies:**
1. **Consistent carb intake:** Same amount at same times
2. **Monitor closely:** Check blood sugar or symptoms 4-6x daily
3. **Hydrate:** Dehydration worsens high blood sugar
4. **Avoid infections:** Illness raises blood sugar significantly
5. **Rotate injection sites:** Prevents lipohypertrophy (lumps)

**Survival priorities for diabetics:**
1. **Secure insulin supply first** (highest priority)
2. **Reliable carb source** (rice, oats, dried fruit)
3. **Water access** (dehydration is dangerous)
4. **Avoid infections** (delays healing, raises blood sugar)
5. **Plan for long-term** (rationing strategies, evacuation routes)

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Eating snow/drinking cold water for hypo:** Slows absorption, delays treatment
2. ❌ **Giving food/drink to unconscious person:** Choking risk, aspiration
3. ❌ **Exercising with high blood sugar + ketones:** Makes DKA worse
4. ❌ **Storing insulin in hot car:** Degrades in hours
5. ❌ **Ignoring mild hypo symptoms:** Can progress to severe in 20-30 minutes
6. ❌ **Over-correcting high blood sugar:** Causes rebound hypoglycemia ("insulin stacking")
7. ❌ **Not preparing for evacuation:** Delays treatment, worsens outcomes

---

## When to Seek Help

**IMMEDIATE evacuation:**
- Severe hypoglycemia (unconscious, seizing) and no recovery
- DKA symptoms (fruity breath, confusion, vomiting, rapid breathing)
- Blood sugar >600 mg/dL
- Unable to keep fluids down for >12 hours
- Chest pain, shortness of breath (cardiac complications)

**Seek help within 24 hours:**
- Blood sugar consistently >300 mg/dL despite treatment
- Moderate ketones in urine
- Vomiting or diarrhea (unable to eat/drink normally)
- Illness/infection (raises blood sugar significantly)

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **Hypoglycemia kills faster than hyperglycemia** (hours vs days) - treat aggressively with 15g carbs
2. ✅ **Insulin can survive 28 days at room temp** - use evaporative cooling to extend
3. ✅ **Type 1 diabetics need insulin to survive** - rationing is dangerous but possible (0.3-0.5 units/kg/day minimum)
4. ✅ **DKA is a medical emergency** - fruity breath, rapid breathing, confusion = evacuate
5. ✅ **Symptom-based monitoring works** - learn to recognize blood sugar ranges by how you feel

**Diabetics can survive in austere conditions, but require careful planning, monitoring, and resource prioritization. Insulin supply is life-critical for Type 1.**
