summary: Selecting appropriate fuel wood by type, moisture content, and intended use.
steps:
- 'Gather wood in stages: tinder → kindling (pencil-thin) → fuel (wrist-thick) → large
  logs.'
- Use standing dead wood — driest available. Avoid wood from the ground (absorbs moisture).
- Softwoods (pine, cedar) ignite easily but burn fast with more smoke — good for starting.
- Hardwoods (oak, maple, hickory) burn longer and hotter — best for sustained fire.
- 'Test dryness: dry wood snaps cleanly, feels light, sounds hollow when knocked together.'
- Split larger pieces to expose dry interior wood in wet conditions.
warnings:
- Green/live wood produces excessive smoke and poor heat.
- Driftwood and treated/painted wood release toxic chemicals when burned.
- Softwood sparks and pops — dangerous near shelters or dry conditions.

## Overview
Selecting appropriate fuel wood by type, moisture content, and intended use.

## Step-by-step
1. Gather wood in stages: tinder → kindling (pencil-thin) → fuel (wrist-thick) → large logs.
2. Use standing dead wood — driest available. Avoid wood from the ground (absorbs moisture).
3. Softwoods (pine, cedar) ignite easily but burn fast with more smoke — good for starting.
4. Hardwoods (oak, maple, hickory) burn longer and hotter — best for sustained fire.
5. Test dryness: dry wood snaps cleanly, feels light, sounds hollow when knocked together.
6. Split larger pieces to expose dry interior wood in wet conditions.

## Warnings
- Green/live wood produces excessive smoke and poor heat.
- Driftwood and treated/painted wood release toxic chemicals when burned.
- Softwood sparks and pops — dangerous near shelters or dry conditions.
