summary: 'Desert survival priorities: water, shade, avoiding heat stress. Dehydration kills fast in desert heat (130F+). Travel at night, rest in shade by day. Conserve water - do not ration (drink when
  thirsty). Signal for rescue. Many desert hazards (snakes, scorpions, flash floods).'
warnings:
- Dehydration symptoms (dark urine, dizziness, confusion) mean you are already in danger
- Desert temperatures swing 40-50F between day and night - prepare for both extremes
- Flash floods kill more people in deserts than dehydration - avoid washes during rain
steps:
- 'WATER: Priority 1. Find water sources (see entry) or carry enough. Minimum 1 gallon per day (more if active). Do NOT ration water - drink when thirsty. Body needs water to cool itself.'
- 'SHADE: Avoid midday heat (10am-4pm). Rest in shade or improvised shelter (tarp, rock overhang, dig trench and cover). Travel early morning, evening, night.'
- 'CLOTHING: Cover all skin (sun protection, reduces sweat evaporation). Light-colored loose clothing. Head covering essential (40 percent heat loss from head).'
- 'SIGNALING: Open terrain = high visibility. Use mirror, fire, bright clothing. Stay visible (ridgelines, clearings).'
- 'HAZARDS: Snakes and scorpions hide in shade (shake out boots, check before sitting). Flash floods in washes (move to high ground if rain visible). Quicksand (rare but possible near dry lakes).'

# Desert Survival — Water, Heat, Navigation, Hazards

Desert survival priorities: water, shade, avoiding heat stress. Dehydration kills fast in desert heat (130F+). Travel at night, rest in shade by day. Conserve water - do not ration (drink when thirsty). Signal for rescue. Many desert hazards (snakes, scorpions, flash floods).
