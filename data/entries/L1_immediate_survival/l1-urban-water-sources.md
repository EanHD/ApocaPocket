# Urban Water Sources - Emergency Extraction

## Overview

**In urban disasters, water supply fails but buildings contain 40-100+ gallons of extractable water.** Most apartments/homes have:
- Water heater: 40-50 gallons (standard residential)
- Toilet tanks: 1-2 gallons each (NOT bowls)
- Pipes: 5-15 gallons (drainage method)
- Ice makers, hot tubs, pools (if accessible)

**Survival priority:** Average person needs 1 gallon/day minimum (drinking + hygiene). Family of 4 = 4 gal/day. A 40-gallon water heater = 10 days for family of 4.

**Action window:** Extract within 24-48 hours of water service loss, before contamination or others take it.

## Water Heater Extraction (40-50 gallons)

### Location
- Basement, utility closet, garage, or laundry room
- Cylindrical tank, 4-5 feet tall, labeled "Water Heater"
- Gas or electric (both have water storage)

### Extraction Steps

**1. Turn off power/gas (0-2 minutes):**
- Electric: Flip breaker labeled "Water Heater" to OFF
- Gas: Turn knob to "Pilot" or "Off" (clockwise)
- **Why:** Prevents heating element from burning out when tank empties

**2. Turn off water inlet (2-3 minutes):**
- Locate cold water inlet pipe (usually top of tank, blue marking)
- Turn valve clockwise until tight (prevents contaminated water from entering)
- If no valve, skip (not critical)

**3. Attach drainage hose (3-5 minutes):**
- Locate drain valve (bottom of tank, looks like garden hose connection)
- Attach garden hose if available (or let water pour into buckets)
- Route hose to sink, bathtub, or collection containers

**4. Open drain valve (5 minutes):**
- Turn drain valve counter-clockwise
- Water may not flow initially - this is normal

**5. Open pressure relief valve (6 minutes):**
- Locate T&P (Temperature & Pressure) valve on side near top
- Lift lever or turn counterclockwise
- **Air must enter for water to drain** (physics: creates siphon effect)
- Water should now flow from drain valve

**6. Collect water (30-60 minutes total drainage):**
- First gallon may contain sediment - discard or filter
- Remaining water is clean (already boiled/heated)
- Fill containers, label with date

### Quick Reference Table

| Tank Size | Gallons | Family of 4 | Solo Person |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Small | 30-40 gal | 7-10 days | 30-40 days |
| Standard | 40-50 gal | 10-12 days | 40-50 days |
| Large | 50-80 gal | 12-20 days | 50-80 days |

**Assumes:** 1 gallon/person/day minimum (0.5 gal drinking, 0.5 gal hygiene)

---

## Toilet Tank Extraction (1-2 gallons each)

### Safety First
- **Toilet TANK (behind seat) = SAFE if no chemicals**
- **Toilet BOWL = NEVER SAFE** (bacteria, fecal contamination)

### Check for Contaminants
**SAFE if:**
- ✓ Clear water
- ✓ No blue/green cleaner tablets
- ✓ No strong chemical smell
- ✓ Just plain water

**NOT SAFE if:**
- ✗ Blue or colored water (cleaner tablets)
- ✗ Chemical smell
- ✗ Slimy or cloudy
- → Skip this toilet, find another

### Extraction Method
1. Remove tank lid carefully (ceramic, heavy, fragile)
2. Bail water with cup or ladle into clean container
3. **Do NOT drink directly** - always purify first (boil 1 min or filter)
4. Typical tank: 1-2 gallons

**Multiple toilets:** 3 toilets = 3-6 gallons total

---

## Pipe Drainage (5-15 gallons)

### Highest Faucet Method

**Concept:** Water sits in vertical pipes between floors. Gravity drains it downward.

**Steps:**
1. **Open highest faucet in building** (top floor, attic, roof)
   - Lets air in, breaks vacuum
   
2. **Open lowest faucet** (basement, ground floor)
   - Water drains from pipes via gravity
   
3. **Collect from lowest point** (bathtub, large sink)
   - May take 10-20 minutes to fully drain
   
4. **Estimate:** Multi-story building = 5-15 gallons from pipes

**Single-story homes:** Only 1-3 gallons in pipes (less vertical distance)

---

## Other Urban Water Sources

### Ice Maker / Freezer Ice
- **Amount:** 5-10 lbs ice = 0.5-1 gallon water when melted
- **Quality:** Safe (made from tap water before disaster)
- **Method:** Let melt naturally or accelerate with body heat

### Hot Tub / Jacuzzi
- **Amount:** 200-400 gallons
- **Quality:** NOT SAFE for drinking (chemicals, bacteria)
- **Use:** Flushing toilets, washing, cleaning (non-potable only)
- **If desperate:** Can be purified with extended boiling (10+ min) + filtration, but risky

### Swimming Pool (if accessible)
- **Amount:** 10,000-20,000 gallons (community pools)
- **Quality:** NOT SAFE for drinking (chlorine, algae, bacteria)
- **Use:** Flushing, washing, fire suppression
- **If desperate:** Requires multiple purification steps (shock, filter, boil) - last resort

### Radiator Water (Building Heating Systems)
- **Amount:** 10-50 gallons (building-wide system)
- **Quality:** MAY contain antifreeze, rust inhibitors
- **Safety:** Assume contaminated unless confirmed water-only
- **Use:** Non-potable only (cleaning, flushing)

### Canned Goods Liquid
- **Vegetables, fruits in water/juice:** SAFE to drink
- **Per can:** 2-4 oz liquid
- **10 cans:** ~1 cup total (not much, but counts)

## Water Treatment After Extraction

### Decision Tree

```
Is water from hot water heater (already heated)?
├─ YES → Safe to drink (internal tank heated regularly)
│         Optional: Boil 1 min for extra safety
│
└─ NO → Must purify before drinking

    Is water clear with no smell?
    ├─ YES → Boil 1 minute (sea level) or 3 min (altitude >6500ft)
    │         OR: Filter with 0.2 micron filter
    │         OR: Chemical treatment (2 drops bleach per quart)
    │
    └─ NO → Cloudy or smelly?
            1. Filter through cloth to remove sediment
            2. Boil 3-5 minutes
            3. Let settle, decant clear water
            4. If still questionable, skip (find better source)
```

### Bleach Treatment (if no boiling available)

| Water Amount | Regular Bleach (6%) | Concentrated (8.25%) |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 1 quart | 2 drops | 2 drops |
| 1 gallon | 8 drops (1/8 tsp) | 6 drops |
| 5 gallons | 1/2 tsp | 1/4 tsp |

**Method:**
1. Add bleach, stir well
2. Wait 30 minutes
3. Should smell slightly of chlorine (if not, repeat dose and wait 15 min)
4. Safe to drink

**Only use:** Unscented, plain bleach (no additives)

---

## Extraction Priority Order

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Water heater** (40-50 gal, cleanest, easiest)
2. **Toilet tanks** (1-2 gal each, if no chemicals)
3. **Pipe drainage** (5-15 gal, moderate effort)
4. **Ice maker / freezer** (0.5-1 gal, safe)
5. **Canned goods** (minimal, but safe)
6. **Hot tub** (last resort, requires purification)

**Skip entirely:** Toilet bowls, radiators (unless confirmed water-only), pools (unless desperate)

## Special Situations

### Contamination Concerns

**When to avoid water:**
- Brown or black (sewage backup possible)
- Strong chemical smell (industrial contamination)
- Oily sheen on surface (petroleum products)
- Dead animals visible in source
- Flood water (sewage mixing common)

**If in doubt, skip that source.** Dehydration takes 3 days; contaminated water can kill in hours.

### Multi-Unit Buildings

**Coordination:**
- Water heater in basement = shared resource
- Negotiate sharing (4 apartments x 10 gallons each = 40 gal allocation)
- Take your share early (before panic)

**Security:**
- Guard water heater location (high-value resource)
- Discreet extraction (at night, low-profile)
- Store water in hidden, secure location

### High-Rise Buildings

**Water pressure fails:** Upper floors lose water first (gravity-fed from roof tanks)

**Strategy:**
1. Go to roof - access water tower/tank (if safe and accessible)
2. Extract from mechanical rooms (building super may have key)
3. Ground floor still has water pressure initially (go down, not up)

---

## Storage After Extraction

### Containers
- Food-grade plastic: HDPE #2 or PET #1 (recycling code on bottom)
- Glass jars (canning jars, juice bottles)
- Clean 2-liter soda bottles (rinse well first)

**Avoid:**
- Milk jugs (protein residue, bacteria growth)
- Containers that held chemicals (never repurpose)

### Storage Method
1. Fill container to top (minimizes air, prevents bacterial growth)
2. Seal tightly
3. Label: "Water - [Date] - [Source]"
4. Store in cool, dark place (basements ideal)
5. Rotate every 6 months if long-term storage

**Shelf life:**
- Properly stored: 6-12 months
- Hot water heater water (already heated): Indefinite if sealed

---

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Drinking toilet bowl water | Only use toilet TANK water (and purify) |
| Not turning off water heater power | Always shut off before draining |
| Waiting too long to extract | Within 24-48 hours of water loss |
| Forgetting pressure relief valve | Must open for water to drain |
| Drinking pool water directly | Only for non-potable uses (or extreme purification) |
| Filling containers halfway | Fill to top to prevent bacterial growth |
| Not labeling water containers | Label date, source, treatment method |
| Mixing safe and unsafe sources | Keep separate (cross-contamination risk) |

---

## When to Evacuate

**Abandon water extraction if:**
- Building structure compromised (cracking, leaning, smoke)
- Fire or gas leak detected
- Violence or looting nearby (personal safety > water)
- Flood water entering building (sewage contamination)

**Take what you can carry, move to safer location.** Water heater extraction takes 30-60 minutes - only do if safe to stay that long.
