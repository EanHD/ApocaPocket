# Caregiver Support: Techniques & Sustainability

## Overview

Caregiving in survival scenarios is physically and emotionally demanding. This entry covers safe lifting and transfer techniques, personal care with dignity, feeding adaptations, pressure sore prevention, non-verbal communication, and caregiver burnout prevention. Caregiving is a group responsibility, not an individual burden.

**Key Principle:** Caregiver health enables care recipient health. Sustainability requires shared responsibility and rest.

## Lifting & Transfer Techniques

### Body Mechanics (Prevent Injury)

**Safe Lifting Principles:**
1. **Bend knees, not back** (use leg muscles, not spine)
2. **Keep load close** to body (reduces strain)
3. **Wide stance** (shoulder-width, provides stability)
4. **Tighten core** (engage abdominal muscles)
5. **Lift with legs** (straighten knees, keep back straight)
6. **Avoid twisting** (pivot with feet, not spine)

**Do NOT Lift If:**
- Person weighs >50% of your body weight (need assistance)
- You have back pain or injury
- Person cannot assist at all (dead weight)

⚠️ **Caregiver back injury is common and disabling. Ask for help.**

### Transfer Methods

**Stand-Pivot Transfer (Person Can Bear Some Weight):**
1. Position wheelchair/chair at 45° angle to destination
2. Lock wheels
3. Person scoots to edge of seat
4. Caregiver stands in front, blocks person's knees with own knees
5. Person leans forward, pushes up with arms
6. Caregiver supports at waist/shoulders
7. Pivot together (small steps)
8. Lower slowly into new seat

**Two-Person Transfer (Person Cannot Stand):**
1. Person 1 (behind): Arms under person's armpits, clasp hands on chest
2. Person 2 (at legs): Hands under knees
3. Lift on count of three
4. Move together, person 1 leads (walking backwards)
5. Lower gently

**Transfer Board (Slide Transfer):**
1. Position chairs close together (remove armrests if possible)
2. Place smooth board (plank, door) from seat to seat at 45° angle
3. Person scoots onto board
4. Slide across board to new seat (caregiver supports)
5. Remove board

### Equipment (Commercial & Improvised)

**Commercial Equipment:**
- **Transfer board:** Smooth, rigid board (12-24" wide)
- **Gait belt:** Fabric belt around person's waist (gives caregiver secure grip)
- **Slide sheet:** Low-friction fabric (person slides easily)
- **Hoyer lift:** Mechanical lift (rare in survival, but gold standard)

**Improvised Equipment:**
| Need | Improvised Solution |
|------|---------------------|
| Transfer board | Smooth plank, car hood, door, plastic sled |
| Gait belt | Rope or cloth belt around waist (NOT under armpits = injury risk) |
| Slide sheet | Slippery tarp, plastic sheeting, garbage bag |
| Lifting sling | Strong tarp or blanket (4 corners held by 4 people) |

## Personal Care

### Bathing

**Bed Bath (If Person Cannot Sit):**
1. **Prepare supplies:** Warm water, soap, washcloths (2), towels, clean clothes
2. **Privacy:** Cover person with blanket, expose only area being washed
3. **Order:** Face → neck → arms → chest → abdomen → legs → back → genitals
4. **Technique:** Wet cloth, soap, wash in circular motions, rinse cloth, wipe off soap
5. **Dry immediately** (prevents chills, skin breakdown)
6. **Change water** after washing genitals (use clean water for rest of body)

**Sitting Bath (If Person Can Sit):**
1. Stable chair or stool
2. Basin or shallow water
3. Assist as needed (wash back, feet)
4. Monitor for dizziness (sitting can lower blood pressure)

**Hair Washing:**
- Lean back over basin or edge of water source
- Wet, shampoo, rinse thoroughly
- Towel dry, comb gently (prevent tangles)

**Frequency:**
- Full bath: 2-3x per week minimum (or as needed)
- Spot cleaning (face, hands, genitals): Daily

### Toileting

**Commode Setup:**
- Stable chair with hole in seat
- Bucket underneath
- Handrails or supports for stability
- Privacy screen (tarp, blanket)

**Bedpan Use:**
1. Warm bedpan (cold metal is uncomfortable)
2. Person lifts hips or rolls to side
3. Slide bedpan under buttocks
4. Provide privacy
5. Clean person after use (front to back)
6. Wash hands (person and caregiver)

**Urinal (Males):**
- Bottle with wide opening
- Position, allow person to urinate
- Empty, rinse immediately

**Incontinence Management:**
- Absorbent pads (commercial diapers or improvised cloth layers)
- Change immediately when soiled (prevents skin breakdown)
- Clean skin with mild soap and water
- Barrier cream (petroleum jelly, diaper cream) protects skin

**Dignity Preservation:**
- Provide privacy (visual and auditory)
- Use matter-of-fact tone (not shameful or embarrassed)
- Allow person to do as much as possible independently
- Respect preferences (ask before assisting)

### Oral Care

**Daily Routine:**
- Brush teeth 2x daily (morning, evening)
- If person cannot rinse/spit: Use damp cloth with toothpaste, wipe teeth/gums
- Mouthwash or saltwater rinse (prevents infection)

**Dentures:**
- Remove nightly
- Clean with soap/toothpaste and water
- Store in water (prevents drying/cracking)

### Infection Prevention

**Hand Hygiene:**
- **Caregiver:** Wash hands before and after every care task
- **Person:** Wash hands after toileting, before eating

**Gloves (If Available):**
- Wear for toileting, wound care, handling bodily fluids
- Change between tasks (don't cross-contaminate)

**Waste Disposal:**
- Bury fecal waste >200 feet from water sources
- Burn or bury used toilet paper
- Clean bedpans/urinals with soap and water, rinse thoroughly

## Feeding

### Aspiration Risk

**What is Aspiration?**
- Food or liquid enters airway (trachea) instead of esophagus
- Can cause choking or pneumonia (aspiration pneumonia = life-threatening)

**High-Risk Individuals:**
- Stroke survivors
- Dementia/Alzheimer's
- Parkinson's disease
- Severe weakness or fatigue
- Anyone with swallowing difficulty (dysphagia)

**Signs of Aspiration:**
- Coughing or choking during/after eating
- Wet or gurgly voice after swallowing
- Difficulty breathing
- Recurrent lung infections

### Feeding Techniques (Reduce Aspiration Risk)

**Positioning:**
- **Sit upright** (90° angle) - NEVER feed lying flat
- Chin slightly tucked (narrows airway opening, widens esophagus)
- Support head if needed (pillow behind neck)
- **Stay upright 30 minutes after eating** (prevents reflux)

**Pacing:**
- Small bites (teaspoon size)
- Wait for swallow before next bite
- Check mouth (ensure food is swallowed, not pocketed in cheeks)
- Slow pace (15-30 minutes for meal)

**Cueing:**
- Verbal: "Take a bite. Chew. Swallow."
- Tactile: Light touch under chin (cue to swallow)
- Visual: Demonstrate (chew, then swallow)

### Texture Modification

**Dysphagia Diet Levels:**
| Level | Texture | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Regular | Normal | All foods |
| Soft | Fork-mashable | Cooked vegetables, ripe bananas, scrambled eggs |
| Minced & Moist | Small pieces, gravy/sauce | Ground meat with gravy, mashed potatoes |
| Pureed | Smooth, pudding-like | Applesauce, pureed soups, mashed banana |
| Liquidized | Drinkable | Smoothies, strained soups |

**Thickened Liquids (Reduce Aspiration Risk):**
- **Thin:** Water, juice, broth (highest aspiration risk)
- **Nectar-thick:** Thicker than water, can drink through straw (tomato juice consistency)
- **Honey-thick:** Drizzles off spoon slowly (honey consistency)
- **Pudding-thick:** Eaten with spoon, does not pour (lowest aspiration risk)

**Improvised Thickeners:**
- Cornstarch or flour (1-2 tbsp per cup liquid)
- Mashed potato flakes
- Blended cooked rice
- Ground crackers or bread

### Hydration

**Fluid Needs:**
- Minimum: 6-8 cups (48-64 oz) per day
- More if hot weather, fever, diarrhea

**Monitoring Hydration:**
- Urine color: Pale yellow = good, dark yellow = dehydrated
- Skin turgor: Pinch skin on back of hand, should snap back quickly
- Dry mouth, sunken eyes = dehydration

**Encouraging Fluids:**
- Offer small sips frequently (every 15-30 min)
- Flavor water (fruit, herbs)
- Ice chips (if chewing/swallowing safe)
- High-water foods (melon, soup, Jello)

### Nutrition

**Calorie Needs:**
- Sedentary adult: 1,500-2,000 cal/day
- Higher needs if healing wounds, fighting infection

**Balanced Intake:**
- Protein (muscle maintenance): Meat, beans, eggs, dairy
- Carbs (energy): Grains, fruits, vegetables
- Fats (concentrated energy): Nuts, oils, fatty fish
- Vitamins/minerals: Variety of foods

**Appetite Stimulants:**
- Serve favorite foods
- Small, frequent meals (6x per day vs 3 large meals)
- Social eating (eat together)
- Pleasant environment (clean, comfortable)

## Pressure Sore Prevention

### Repositioning Schedule

**Frequency:**
- **Bedbound:** Reposition every **2 hours** (day and night)
- **Wheelchair:** Weight shift every **15-30 minutes**

**Why It Matters:**
- Pressure cuts off blood flow
- Tissue dies without oxygen
- Pressure sore develops in 1-2 hours
- Deep sores take months to heal (or never heal)

**Repositioning Positions (Rotate Through):**
1. **Supine (back)** - 2 hours
2. **Left side** - 2 hours
3. **Supine (back)** - 2 hours
4. **Right side** - 2 hours
5. Repeat cycle 24/7

**30° Side-Lying (Optimal):**
- NOT 90° directly on hip (too much pressure on bony prominence)
- 30° angle (supported with pillows behind back)
- Reduces pressure on hip bone

### High-Risk Areas (Bony Prominences)

**Lying on Back:**
- Back of head
- Shoulder blades
- Elbows
- Tailbone (sacrum)
- Heels

**Lying on Side:**
- Ear
- Shoulder
- Hip
- Knee
- Ankle

**Sitting:**
- Tailbone
- Ischial tuberosities (sit bones)
- Shoulder blades (if leaning back)

### Skin Inspection

**Daily Checks (Morning & Evening):**
1. Expose high-risk areas
2. Look for redness, warmth, swelling
3. Press with finger (does redness blanch/turn white?)
4. Check for open sores, blisters, broken skin

**Pressure Injury Stages:**
| Stage | Appearance | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Stage 1 | Red area that doesn't blanch | Stop pressure immediately, increase repositioning |
| Stage 2 | Blister or shallow open sore | Clean, dress, relieve pressure 100% |
| Stage 3 | Deep crater, fat visible | Clean, pack wound, evacuate if possible |
| Stage 4 | Very deep, muscle/bone visible | Life-threatening, EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY |

⚠️ **Once a pressure sore opens, infection risk is high. Prevention is critical.**

### Cushioning & Surfaces

**Pressure-Relieving Surfaces:**
- Foam mattress (4" thick minimum)
- Air mattress (slightly deflated = conforms to body)
- Sheepskin or soft blankets (multiple layers)
- Water-filled cushions

**Wheelchair Cushions:**
- Foam (2-4" thick)
- Gel cushion (commercial)
- Air cushion (inflatable)

**Improvised Cushioning:**
| Need | Improvised Solution |
|------|---------------------|
| Mattress pad | Folded blankets, clothing, moss (in waterproof bag) |
| Heel protectors | Pillow under calves (heels float), cloth wrapped around ankles |
| Elbow pads | Soft cloth wrap, foam pieces |
| Wheelchair cushion | Folded blankets, inflated trash bags |

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Donut cushions (concentrate pressure on surrounding area = worse)
- ❌ Hard surfaces (wood, stone)

### Skin Care

**Keep Clean & Dry:**
- Wash daily with mild soap and water
- Pat dry (don't rub)
- Moisture = skin breakdown (change wet clothing/bedding immediately)

**Barrier Protection:**
- Petroleum jelly on high-risk areas (reduces friction)
- Zinc oxide cream (diaper cream) if skin irritated
- Powder (cornstarch, talcum) reduces moisture

**Avoid:**
- Massage directly on red areas (can worsen tissue damage)
- Hot water (dries skin)
- Harsh soaps (strip natural oils)

## Communication

### Non-Verbal Cues

**Reading Body Language:**
| Cue | Possible Meaning |
|-----|------------------|
| Grimacing, furrowed brow | Pain |
| Restlessness, fidgeting | Discomfort, need to reposition |
| Withdrawal, turning away | Overstimulated, need space |
| Reaching, pointing | Need or want something |
| Smiling, relaxed posture | Comfortable, content |

**Vocalizations (Non-Verbal People):**
- Moaning, groaning = pain or discomfort
- Crying = distress, fear, sadness
- Laughing = happy, comfortable
- Repetitive sounds = self-soothing or overstimulation

### Pain Assessment (Non-Verbal)

**FLACC Pain Scale (0-10):**
| Category | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|----------|---|---|---|
| **Face** | Smiling, no distress | Occasional grimace | Frequent grimace, clenched jaw |
| **Legs** | Relaxed | Restless, tense | Kicking, drawn up |
| **Activity** | Lying quietly | Squirming | Arched, rigid |
| **Cry** | No cry | Moans, whimpers | Crying steadily, screaming |
| **Consolability** | Content | Reassured by touch/talk | Difficult to console |

**Score:** Add points from each category (0-10 total)
- 0 = No pain
- 1-3 = Mild pain
- 4-6 = Moderate pain
- 7-10 = Severe pain

**Action:**
- Mild: Comfort measures (reposition, massage, distraction)
- Moderate: Pain medication (if available)
- Severe: Pain medication + investigate cause, consider evacuation

### Respecting Choices

**Autonomy:**
- Offer choices: "Do you want to eat now or in 10 minutes?"
- Respect refusals (don't force)
- Explain before acting: "I'm going to help you sit up now"
- Ask permission: "May I wash your face?"

**Consent:**
- Even non-verbal people can indicate yes/no (head nod, eye blinks, gesture)
- If person resists care (pulls away, pushes hand), stop and reassess
- Essential care (life-sustaining): Explain, go slowly, offer comfort

## Caregiver Burnout

### Recognize Signs

**Physical:**
- Exhaustion, insomnia
- Frequent illness (lowered immunity)
- Chronic pain (back, shoulders)
- Weight loss or gain
- Neglecting own health

**Emotional:**
- Irritability, anger
- Anxiety, depression
- Feeling overwhelmed or hopeless
- Guilt (never doing enough)
- Resentment toward care recipient

**Behavioral:**
- Withdrawing from others
- Neglecting responsibilities
- Using substances (alcohol, medications) to cope
- Decreased patience or compassion

⚠️ **Burnout reduces quality of care and harms both caregiver and care recipient.**

### Respite Strategies

**Respite = Break from Caregiving (Essential, Not Optional)**

**Scheduled Breaks:**
- 15-30 minutes every 4 hours (minimum)
- 2-4 hours off per day (another caregiver takes over)
- 1 full day off per week (if group can support)

**Respite Activities:**
- Rest, sleep, nap
- Personal hygiene (long bath, self-care)
- Solitude (walk alone, sit quietly)
- Hobbies (reading, crafting, journaling)
- Socializing (talk with others, not about caregiving)

**Micro-Breaks (During Caregiving):**
- Deep breathing (5 breaths, slow in/out)
- Stretch (shoulders, neck, back)
- Step outside (fresh air, change of scenery)
- Brief distraction (listen to music, look at photo)

### Ask for Help

**Why Caregivers Don't Ask:**
- Guilt ("It's my responsibility")
- Fear ("No one else can do it right")
- Shame ("I should be able to handle this")
- Isolation ("No one is available")

**Truth:**
- Asking for help is strength, not weakness
- Everyone needs support
- Sharing care improves outcomes
- Preventing burnout protects both people

**How to Ask:**
- Be specific: "Can you help me reposition John at 2pm?"
- Make it easy: "I need 30 minutes, can you sit with her?"
- Accept imperfection: Others may do tasks differently (that's OK)
- Express gratitude: "Thank you, that really helped me"

---

## Group Dynamics

### Share Caregiving

**Rotate Duties:**
- Assign shifts (2-4 hours each)
- Rotate tasks (one person does bathing, another does feeding)
- Primary caregiver + backup system

**Schedule Example (3 Caregivers, 24 Hours):**
| Time | Caregiver |
|------|-----------|
| 00:00-08:00 | Caregiver A (night shift) |
| 08:00-16:00 | Caregiver B (day shift) |
| 16:00-00:00 | Caregiver C (evening shift) |

**Benefits:**
- No single person exhausted
- Fresh perspective catches problems
- Care recipient interacts with multiple people
- Sustainable long-term

### Train Backups

**Cross-Training:**
- Teach multiple people all care tasks
- Practice together (demonstrate techniques)
- Create written/visual guides
- Normalize asking questions

**Documentation:**
- Care log (track repositioning, meals, medications)
- Procedure checklists (step-by-step guides)
- Contact info for emergencies

**Why Multiple Trained Caregivers:**
- Primary caregiver may become ill/injured
- Distributes knowledge (prevents single point of failure)
- Builds confidence (people more willing to help when trained)

### Emotional Support

**Caregiver Support Needs:**
- Validation: "This is hard work, you're doing great"
- Empathy: "I see how tired you are"
- Practical help: Do, don't just offer ("I'll bring you dinner")
- Non-judgment: Caregiving is messy and imperfect

**Group Check-Ins:**
- Daily brief meeting: "How is everyone doing?"
- Address concerns early (before crisis)
- Adjust plans as needed (increase support if caregiver struggling)
