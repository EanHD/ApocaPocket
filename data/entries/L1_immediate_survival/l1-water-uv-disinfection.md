summary: SODIS uses UV-A radiation and heat from sunlight to kill pathogens in water. Endorsed by WHO. Requires only clear PET plastic bottles and sunlight. Free, requires no chemicals or fuel.
warnings:
- 'SODIS does NOT work through glass — glass blocks UV-A. Must use PET plastic (recycle symbol #1) or clear plastic bags'
- SODIS does NOT remove chemical contaminants, turbidity, or bad taste
- Bottles must be clear and unscratched — scratches block UV penetration. Replace bottles when they become cloudy
- SODIS is NOT reliable in overcast or rainy conditions — you need direct sunlight
- Water must be clear (turbidity <30 NTU). If you cannot read newspaper print through the bottle, pre-filter first
steps:
- Collect clear PET plastic bottles (1-2 liter soda bottles work best). Remove labels so sunlight can penetrate from all sides. Bottles must be unscratched and clear.
- Pre-filter water through cloth (cotton shirt, bandana) if any visible particles. Water must be visually clear. If still cloudy, let it settle for 1 hour and decant.
- Fill bottles ¾ full, cap, and shake vigorously for 20 seconds. This oxygenates the water and speeds up pathogen killing (reactive oxygen from UV + dissolved O2).
- Top off bottle completely and cap tightly. Lay bottles horizontally on a reflective surface (corrugated metal roof, aluminum foil, light-colored surface). Horizontal position maximizes UV exposure through
  the thin side of the bottle.
- 'FULL SUN exposure times: 6 hours minimum on a clear sunny day. If partly cloudy: 2 full days. If >50% cloud cover: SODIS is unreliable — use another method.'
- 'Temperature boost: if water reaches 50°C (122°F) during treatment, 1 hour of sunlight is sufficient. Black-painted lower half of bottle increases heating. On hot metal roofs, bottles easily reach this
  temperature.'
- 'UV intensity varies by latitude: tropics (23°N-23°S) get strongest UV and SODIS works fastest. Above 50°N/S latitude, SODIS may be insufficient October through March.'
- 'Maximum bottle size: 2 liters. UV cannot penetrate deeply enough in larger containers. For larger volumes, use multiple bottles.'
- After treatment, drink directly from the bottle or pour into a clean container. Do not re-contaminate by adding untreated water or using dirty cups.
- SODIS kills bacteria (E.coli, cholera, salmonella), viruses (rotavirus, hepatitis A), and most protozoa. Cryptosporidium requires higher UV doses — if suspected, combine SODIS with filtration.
