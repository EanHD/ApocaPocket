# Cognitive Disabilities: Survival Adaptations

## Overview

Cognitive disabilities include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disabilities, PTSD, traumatic brain injury (TBI), dementia, and processing disorders. Survival strategies emphasize routine, clear communication, visual supports, and patient instruction. Everyone deserves accessible information and the opportunity to contribute meaningfully.

**Key Principle:** Simplify, structure, and support. Adapt communication to the person, not vice versa.

**Person-First Language:** "Person with autism" vs. "autistic" - respect individual preferences. Many in the autism community prefer identity-first language ("autistic person").

## Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

### Routine & Predictability

**Why It Matters:**
- Reduces anxiety and meltdowns
- Improves focus and cooperation
- Provides sense of control in chaotic situations
- Conserves mental energy

**Creating Routine:**
1. Establish daily schedule (wake, eat, work, rest, sleep at consistent times)
2. Post visual schedule (pictures or words)
3. Warn before transitions: "In 5 minutes, we'll eat lunch"
4. Use timers (visual countdown)
5. Same sequence daily (builds automatic response)

**Sample Daily Structure:**
| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| 07:00 | Wake, personal care | 30 min |
| 07:30 | Breakfast | 30 min |
| 08:00 | Morning tasks (water, fire) | 60 min |
| 09:00 | Break | 15 min |
| 09:15 | Work (assigned task) | 90 min |
| 10:45 | Break | 15 min |
| 11:00 | Work continues | 60 min |
| 12:00 | Lunch | 45 min |
| 12:45 | Quiet time | 30 min |
| 13:15 | Afternoon tasks | 90 min |
| 14:45 | Break | 15 min |
| 15:00 | Work/skill practice | 60 min |
| 16:00 | Prepare dinner | 60 min |
| 17:00 | Dinner | 45 min |
| 17:45 | Evening tasks | 30 min |
| 18:15 | Personal time | 60 min |
| 19:15 | Evening routine | 30 min |
| 19:45 | Sleep prep | 15 min |
| 20:00 | Sleep | — |

⚠️ **When disruptions occur (storm, emergency):** Explain what changed, what stays the same, and when routine will resume.

### Sensory Considerations

**Sensory Sensitivities (Common):**
- **Sound:** Loud noises, sudden sounds, multiple voices
- **Touch:** Certain textures, tight clothing, unexpected touch
- **Sight:** Bright lights, flashing, clutter
- **Smell:** Strong odors (smoke, cooking, body odor)
- **Taste:** Limited food preferences (texture, temperature)

**Creating Low-Stimulation Zones:**

**Quiet Zone Setup:**
1. Locate away from high-traffic areas
2. Soft surfaces (blankets, grass, sand)
3. Dim lighting (natural shade preferred)
4. Minimal noise (away from fire, people)
5. Predictable access (person can go anytime)
6. Visual boundary marker (rope, sticks) = "quiet zone, respect needed"

**Sensory Regulation Tools:**
- Fidget items (smooth stones, sticks, cord)
- Weighted blanket or heavy clothing
- Noise-dampening (cloth over ears, distance from noise)
- Sunglasses or brimmed hat (reduce visual input)
- Consistent textures (favorite clothing, blanket)

### Meltdowns vs. Tantrums

**Meltdown = Involuntary Neurological Response to Overwhelm**
- NOT behavioral (person cannot control it)
- Caused by sensory overload, exhaustion, anxiety
- Person may scream, hit self, rock, shut down
- Needs: Space, time, low stimulation

**Response to Meltdown:**
1. **Safety first:** Remove from danger (fire, water, hazards)
2. **Reduce stimulation:** Quiet, dim, fewer people
3. **Give space:** Don't crowd, restrain only if necessary for safety
4. **Wait:** Meltdown will pass (10 minutes to 1 hour)
5. **No punishment:** It's not a choice

**Prevention:**
- Monitor stress signals (increased stimming, withdrawal, irritability)
- Offer breaks before meltdown
- Maintain routine and predictability
- Reduce sensory triggers

### Communication Adjustments

**Concrete, Literal Language:**
- ✅ "Put the cup on the table" (specific action)
- ❌ "Take care of that" (vague)
- ✅ "We'll eat in 10 minutes" (precise time)
- ❌ "We'll eat soon" (unclear)

**Avoid Idioms & Sarcasm:**
- ❌ "It's raining cats and dogs" → ✅ "It's raining heavily"
- ❌ "Break a leg" → ✅ "Good luck"
- ❌ Sarcasm (tone and words don't match = confusing)

**Processing Time:**
- Ask question
- Wait 5-10 seconds (don't repeat immediately)
- Allow time to formulate response
- Don't rush or interrupt

**Visual Supports:**
- Written instructions
- Picture sequences (step-by-step photos/drawings)
- Checklists (check off completed items)

---

## Intellectual Disabilities

### Simple Language

**Guidelines:**
- Short sentences (5-10 words)
- One idea per sentence
- Common words (avoid jargon)
- Active voice ("Light the fire" not "The fire should be lit")

**Example Simplification:**
- Complex: "Prior to commencing the water purification process, ensure the receptacle is sanitized"
- Simple: "Before you clean the water, wash the container"

### Visual Aids

**Types:**
| Visual Aid | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| Picture schedule | Daily routine |
| Step-by-step photos | Multi-step tasks (starting fire, cooking) |
| Checklists (with images) | Task completion |
| Color coding | Organize belongings (blue bag = clothes, red bag = food) |
| Arrows/markers | Navigate camp safely |

**Creating Visual Instructions:**
1. Take photos of each step
2. Print or draw simple images
3. Sequence left-to-right or top-to-bottom
4. Number steps
5. Laminate or protect from weather
6. Keep in consistent location

### Repetition & Practice

**Learning New Skills:**
1. **Demonstrate:** Show the complete task
2. **Break down:** One step at a time
3. **Practice:** Repeat step until mastered
4. **Next step:** Add second step
5. **Chain:** Link steps together
6. **Repeat daily:** Practice until automatic

**Reinforcement:**
- Praise effort and completion: "You started the fire successfully"
- Specific feedback: "Good job stacking the wood correctly"
- Celebrate small wins
- Be patient with repetition (may take 20-50+ repetitions)

### Patient Instruction

**Teaching Pace:**
- One new skill at a time
- Mastery before moving on (80%+ success rate)
- Expect slower learning curve
- Avoid frustration (take breaks if needed)

**Task Difficulty:**
- Start with simplest version
- Gradually increase complexity
- Provide assistance as needed
- Scaffold (support, then fade support)

## PTSD & Trauma

### Trigger Awareness

**Common Triggers:**
- Loud noises (gunshots, fireworks, backfiring)
- Sudden movements
- Yelling/raised voices
- Physical restraint
- Specific smells (smoke, certain foods)
- Darkness or confinement
- Loss of control

**Identifying Triggers:**
- Ask person about known triggers (if safe to discuss)
- Observe reactions (freezing, startle response, withdrawal)
- Document (helps group avoid triggers)

**Reducing Triggers:**
- Warn before loud noises: "I'm going to chop wood now, it will be loud"
- Approach from front, never sneak up
- Use calm, level voice
- Give personal space
- Provide choices (restores sense of control)

### Safe Spaces

**Physical Safe Space:**
- Private area (tent, corner of shelter, behind barrier)
- Person can access anytime without permission
- Others do not enter without invitation
- Comfortable (blankets, familiar items)

**Emotional Safety:**
- Consistent, trustworthy people
- No judgment or pressure to share trauma
- Respect boundaries
- Predictable environment (routine helps)

### Grounding Techniques

**5-4-3-2-1 Method (When Triggered):**
1. Name **5 things** you can see
2. Name **4 things** you can touch
3. Name **3 things** you can hear
4. Name **2 things** you can smell
5. Name **1 thing** you can taste

**Purpose:** Brings person back to present moment (out of flashback)

**Physical Grounding:**
- Hold cold object (ice, cold water)
- Stomp feet on ground
- Clap hands
- Splash water on face
- Focus on breathing (5 seconds in, 5 seconds out)

### Predictable Routines

**Why Routine Helps PTSD:**
- Reduces hypervigilance (don't have to constantly predict what's next)
- Provides structure in chaos
- Builds trust (environment is reliable)
- Conserves mental energy

**Implementation:**
- Same as ASD routines (see above)
- Warn before changes
- Maintain as much normalcy as possible
- Rebuild routine quickly after disruptions

## Dementia & Memory Loss

### Labeling System

**What to Label:**
- Storage containers (FOOD, WATER, TOOLS)
- Locations (TOILET, SHELTER, FIRE)
- Personal items (NAME'S BAG)
- Paths (TO WATER, TO LATRINE)

**Label Format:**
- Large print (minimum 1-inch letters)
- High contrast (black on white)
- Simple words or pictures
- Durable (waterproof)

**Memory Aids:**
- Photo of person's sleeping area
- Picture of family/loved ones (comforting)
- Consistent placement (items never move)

### Consistent Placement

**"A Place for Everything":**
- Assign location for each item
- Never vary location
- Visual marker (tape outline on shelf, colored mat)
- Verbal reminder: "Your cup is always on the blue mat"

**Personal Space Setup:**
- Bed in same corner always
- Belongings in same order (left to right: clothes, shoes, personal items)
- Nighttime items within arm's reach
- No rearranging (even to "help")

### Supervision

**Levels of Supervision:**
| Stage | Supervision Level | Support Needed |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| Early | Periodic check-ins | Reminders, gentle redirection |
| Moderate | Line of sight | Constant visual monitoring |
| Advanced | Arm's length | Physical guidance, full assistance |

**Supervision Tasks:**
- Medication management (timed, observed)
- Fire safety (never alone near fire)
- Tool use (supervise sharp objects)
- Navigation (buddy system, never wanders alone)

### Wandering Prevention

**Why Wandering Happens:**
- Searching for "home" (disoriented)
- Following old routine (going to work)
- Restlessness, boredom
- Sundowning (confusion increases at dusk)

**Prevention Strategies:**

**Physical Boundaries:**
- Rope barrier around camp perimeter (visual reminder)
- Bell on rope (alerts if crossed)
- Locked or secured tent/shelter exit (person inside, caregiver nearby)

**Engagement:**
- Purposeful activity (folding clothes, sorting items)
- Supervised walks (accompanied, scheduled)
- Reduce boredom (music, conversation, simple tasks)

**ID System:**
- Bracelet with name, camp location
- Sewn-in labels on clothing
- Whistle on lanyard (if lost, blow continuously)

⚠️ **If Person Wanders:**
1. Alert group immediately (time is critical)
2. Search systematic grid pattern
3. Check water sources, paths, shade (common destinations)
4. Call name repeatedly (may recognize voice)
5. Bring back gently (don't scold)

## Task Breakdown

### One Step at a Time

**Multi-Step Task Example: Making Tea**

**Wrong Approach (Too Much at Once):**
- "Make tea" (person may not know where to start)

**Right Approach (Step-by-Step):**
1. "Get the cup" → Wait for completion
2. "Put tea bag in cup" → Wait
3. "Pour hot water into cup" → Wait
4. "Wait 3 minutes" → Use timer
5. "Remove tea bag" → Wait
6. "Add honey if you want" → Optional step
7. "Done, enjoy your tea" → Completion acknowledged

### Visual Checklists

**Checklist Components:**
- [ ] Checkbox (physical checking = satisfying completion)
- Picture or icon (visual reminder)
- Simple text (verb + object)
- Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...)

**Example: Morning Routine Checklist**
```
1. [ ] 🛏️ Make bed
2. [ ] 🪥 Brush teeth
3. [ ] 👕 Get dressed
4. [ ] 🍳 Eat breakfast
5. [ ] 💧 Fill water bottle
6. [ ] ✅ Check task board
```

**Reusable System:**
- Laminate checklist
- Use dry-erase marker to check boxes
- Erase at end of day (ready for tomorrow)

### Hands-On Demonstration

**Learning by Doing:**
1. **"I do, you watch"** - Complete task while person observes
2. **"We do together"** - Guide hands through task (hand-over-hand)
3. **"You do, I watch"** - Person completes task with supervision
4. **"You do alone"** - Person completes independently

**Repeat cycle** until person achieves consistent success.

**Key Points:**
- Go slowly (resist urge to rush)
- Praise attempts (not just perfection)
- Correct gently: "Let's try this way" (not "You did it wrong")
- Repeat as many times as needed

---

## Communication Strategies

### Clear, Concrete Language

**Do:**
- ✅ "Chop the wood" (specific action)
- ✅ "We eat at noon" (exact time)
- ✅ "Three people will gather berries" (specific number)

**Don't:**
- ❌ "Handle the wood situation" (vague)
- ❌ "We'll eat later" (ambiguous)
- ❌ "Some people should forage" (unclear)

### Avoid Idioms

**Idioms to Avoid:**
| Idiom | Literal Interpretation | Say Instead |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|
| "Break a leg" | Injure yourself | "Good luck" |
| "It's raining cats and dogs" | Animals falling from sky | "It's raining hard" |
| "Bite the bullet" | Chew ammunition | "Do the difficult thing" |
| "Under the weather" | Beneath the sky | "Feeling sick" |
| "Piece of cake" | Dessert | "Easy" |

### Confirm Understanding

**Don't Ask:** "Do you understand?" (Person may say yes to avoid embarrassment)

**Do Ask:**
- "Can you show me how to do it?" (demonstration proves understanding)
- "What's the first step?" (verbal confirmation)
- "Tell me in your own words" (paraphrase check)

**Alternative Confirmation:**
- Watch person complete task
- Ask questions: "What tool do you need next?"

---

## Group Support

### Patience

**Managing Frustration:**
- Remember: Cognitive disabilities are neurological, not behavioral
- Person is doing their best with available capacity
- Frustration delays learning (creates anxiety)
- Take breaks if you feel impatient

**Time Investment:**
- Teaching takes longer initially
- Independence develops over weeks/months
- Patience now = capability later

### Respect

**Dignity & Autonomy:**
- Include person in decisions (when appropriate)
- Don't talk about person as if they're not present
- Use age-appropriate language (don't talk to adult like a child)
- Value contributions (everyone has strengths)

**Person-First Language (When Preferred):**
- "Person with autism" (not "autistic person") - if individual prefers
- "Person with intellectual disability" (not "the disabled person")
- Ask individual's preference and respect it

### Appropriate Tasks

**Matching Skills to Tasks:**
| Skill Level | Appropriate Tasks |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Low support needs | Food prep, tool maintenance, crafts, teaching others |
| Moderate support | Gathering (with buddy), sorting items, fire tending (supervised) |
| High support | Simple repetitive tasks (folding, stacking), companionship, supervised activities |

**Task Adaptation:**
- Simplify complex tasks (break into smaller steps)
- Provide visual guides
- Pair with mentor (learns while contributing)
- Rotate tasks (builds multiple skills)

### Celebrate Successes

**Positive Reinforcement:**
- Acknowledge effort: "You worked hard on that"
- Specific praise: "You stacked the wood neatly"
- Public recognition (in group, if person is comfortable)
- Tangible rewards (first choice of food, extra personal time)

**Build Confidence:**
- Success → confidence → willingness to try new things
- Confidence is foundation for learning
- Celebrate small wins (not just major achievements)

---

## Medication & Medical Considerations

### Medication Management

**Common Medications:**
- **Antipsychotics** (schizophrenia, severe autism): Risperidone, olanzapine
- **Stimulants** (ADHD): Methylphenidate, amphetamine
- **Antidepressants** (depression, anxiety): SSRIs
- **Mood stabilizers** (bipolar): Lithium, valproate
- **Anti-anxiety** (panic, PTSD): Benzodiazepines

**Storage:**
- Cool, dry location (not extreme heat/cold)
- Original containers (with instructions)
- Protected from light (if light-sensitive)

**Administration:**
- Consistent times daily (use timer/schedule)
- Supervised (ensure person takes medication)
- Track doses (checklist or log)

⚠️ **Sudden Discontinuation Risks:**
- Withdrawal symptoms (nausea, anxiety, tremors)
- Return of symptoms (psychosis, mania, severe depression)
- Medical emergency possible

**Rationing Protocol:**
- If supply limited, do NOT stop suddenly
- Taper gradually (reduce by 25% per week)
- Prioritize essential medications (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers)
- Seek evacuation if medication runs out

### Behavioral Changes

**Monitor for Crisis Signs:**
- Severe aggression (danger to self/others)
- Psychosis (hallucinations, delusions)
- Suicidal ideation
- Severe self-injury
- Complete withdrawal (not eating, drinking, responding)

**Crisis Response:**
1. Ensure safety (remove dangerous objects)
2. Calm environment (reduce stimulation)
3. Do not restrain unless imminent danger
4. Speak calmly, give space
5. **Evacuate** if symptoms severe or prolonged
