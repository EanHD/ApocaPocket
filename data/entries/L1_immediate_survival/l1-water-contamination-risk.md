## Overview
Simple field risk matrix for choosing safer water sources under constraints.

## Step-by-step
1. Prioritize protected springs/deep wells over surface runoff.
2. Avoid sources downstream from settlements/agriculture.
3. Assess signs of algal blooms, odor, discoloration.
4. Treat all suspect sources before consumption.

## Warnings
- Clear water may still be biologically unsafe.
- Chemical contamination is often invisible without testing.
