difficulty: beginner-intermediate
time_required: 5-30 minutes (depending on method)
materials_needed:
- Commercial filter (Sawyer, LifeStraw, Katadyn) OR improvised materials (cloth, sand, charcoal, gravel)
- Container for filtered water
- Pre-filter cloth (bandana, coffee filter)
- Optional: backup chemical disinfection (iodine/chlorine tablets)
summary: Water filtration removes sediment, protozoa (Giardia, Crypto), and bacteria through physical barriers. Pore size determines effectiveness 0.1-0.2 micron filters remove protozoa and bacteria (99.99%+), 0.02 micron removes viruses. Improvised filters remove sediment only - must combine with boiling/chemical treatment. Filter first, then disinfect for maximum safety.
warnings:
- Most field filters do NOT remove dissolved chemicals, heavy metals, salt, or viruses (>0.2 micron filters)
- Virus removal requires <0.02 micron filter OR chemical/UV disinfection after filtration
- Improvised filters (cloth, sand, charcoal) remove SEDIMENT ONLY — do not remove pathogens without additional treatment
- Filters can clog or crack — carry backup treatment method (tablets, boiling capability)
- Cold water filtration is slower — warm water flows faster through filters
steps:
- 'FILTRATION BASICS: Understanding what filters remove vs retain. Sediment (dirt, debris): removed by any filter. Protozoan cysts (Giardia 8-14 microns, Cryptosporidium 4-6 microns): removed by 0.1-1 micron filters. Bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella 0.5-3 microns): removed by 0.1-0.3 micron filters. Viruses (Hepatitis A, Norovirus 0.02-0.1 microns): require <0.02 micron OR hollow fiber filters with chemical treatment. Chemicals, heavy metals, salt: NOT removed by mechanical filters (need activated carbon or distillation).'
- 'COMMERCIAL FILTER TYPES: 1) HOLLOW FIBER FILTERS (Sawyer Mini, LifeStraw): 0.1-0.2 micron pore size, removes protozoa + bacteria, lifespan 100,000+ gallons, weight 2-3 oz, must be kept from freezing (cracks fibers), flow rate 1-2 liters/minute. 2) CERAMIC FILTERS (Katadyn, MSR): 0.2-0.3 micron, can be scrubbed clean, fragile (can crack), lifespan 13,000 gallons, weight 8-16 oz. 3) PUMP FILTERS (MSR Guardian, Katadyn Hiker): 0.1-0.2 micron, fast flow (1 liter/minute), heavy (1-1.5 lbs), good for groups. 4) GRAVITY FILTERS (Platypus GravityWorks): hang bag, gravity feeds through filter, hands-free, 1.5-4 liters capacity.'
- 'PRE-FILTRATION (critical for filter life): Turbid/muddy water clogs filters rapidly. ALWAYS pre-filter: 1) Let water settle 2-4 hours in container, decant clear water from top. 2) Strain through cloth (bandana, t-shirt, coffee filter) 2-3 times. 3) Use pre-filter screen if included with commercial filter. Pre-filtering extends filter life 300-500%. In emergency, pre-filter even if takes extra time.'
- 'IMPROVISED SAND FILTER (removes sediment + some bacteria): Requires: 5-gallon bucket or cut plastic bottle, gravel (2-3 layers: fist-sized, pebble, fine gravel), sand (fine grain, clean, 8-12 inches deep), charcoal (activated if possible, crushed to pea-size, 4-6 inches), cloth (bottom layer to hold materials). Construction: Bottom to top layers: cloth, fine gravel (2 inches), coarse gravel (2 inches), sand (8-12 inches, most critical layer), crushed charcoal (4-6 inches), gravel (2 inches). Total depth: 16-24 inches. Pour water slowly into top, collect from bottom spout/hole. First 2-3 liters flush the system (discard). Flow rate: 1 quart per 10-15 minutes. EFFECTIVENESS: removes 90-95% sediment, 50-70% bacteria, minimal protozoa removal. MUST boil or chemically treat filtered water after.'
- 'CLOTH FILTRATION (basic sediment removal): Tightly woven cotton cloth (t-shirt, sari cloth, bandana) folded 4-8 layers. Pour water through slowly. Removes 50-70% of sediment and large particulates. Reduces cholera bacteria (which attach to plankton) by 50%. Removes NO protozoa or viruses. Improves water clarity for subsequent boiling/chemical treatment. Wash cloth after each use. Effectiveness increases with more layers (diminishing returns after 8 layers).'
- 'TRIPOD FILTER (layered cloth method): Tie three long sticks in tripod, suspend cloth bag filled with: first layer (bottom) = fine cloth or coffee filter, second layer = crushed charcoal (if available), third layer (top) = coarse cloth or grass. Pour water through layers. Gravity fed. Similar to sand filter but faster setup (10 minutes). Less effective but useful when materials limited.'
- 'BOTTLE FILTER (primitive): Cut bottom off plastic bottle (2-liter), invert, stuff with filtration layers (bottom to top): cloth/cotton ball plug, charcoal (crushed), sand (fine), gravel (small), cloth/grass (pre-filter). Pour water in top (cut bottom now facing up), collect from bottle mouth (original top). Flow rate: 1 cup per 5-10 minutes. Must follow with boiling.'
- 'USING COMMERCIAL FILTERS: 1) READ INSTRUCTIONS — pore size, flow rate, capacity, maintenance. 2) Prime filter per instructions (usually backflush with clean water). 3) Pre-filter source water through cloth. 4) Connect filter between dirty water source and clean container. 5) Pump/squeeze/gravity feed per design. 6) MAINTAIN: backflush every 20-50 liters (extends life), store dry, protect from freezing. 7) TRACK USAGE: mark on filter or log to know when approaching lifespan limit. Reduced flow = clog (backflush) or end of life (replace).'
- 'COLD WEATHER CONSIDERATIONS: Hollow fiber and ceramic filters CRACK if water inside freezes (expanding ice). Prevention: 1) Store filter inside sleeping bag at night. 2) Blow air through filter after use to expel water. 3) Keep filter in inside jacket pocket when traveling. If filter freezes: assume compromised, use backup method (boiling, chemical). Some manufacturers (MSR Guardian) advertise freeze-proof designs.'
- 'FILTER + DISINFECTION COMBO (maximum safety): BEST PRACTICE: Filter first (removes sediment and protozoa/bacteria), then chemically disinfect or boil (kills viruses and any remaining pathogens). Why combo: 1) Filtering clarifies water making chemical treatment more effective. 2) Removes bad taste/smell improving drinkability. 3) Chemical treatment kills viruses that many filters miss. 4) Redundancy = safety. Time: filter 1 liter in 2-5 minutes, chemical treat for 30 minutes, total 35-40 minutes.'
- 'FILTER VERIFICATION: How to confirm filter working: 1) Visual: filtered water is clear (not cloudy). 2) Flow rate: consistent with manufacturer specs (slowing = clog). 3) Taste: no sediment grit when drinking. 4) Inspection: no cracks in housing or filter element. If uncertain: boil filtered water before drinking.'
- 'EMERGENCY NO-FILTER OPTION: If no filter or materials: 1) SETTLE + DECANT: let water sit 4-6 hours, carefully pour clear water from top without disturbing sediment. 2) BOIL: rolling boil for 1-3 minutes (altitude adjusted). This is always safe but requires fuel. 3) CHEMICAL TREAT: clear water (settled) with iodine/chlorine tablets per instructions.'

# Emergency Water Filtration Systems

Water filtration removes sediment, protozoa (Giardia, Crypto), and bacteria through physical barriers. Pore size determines effectiveness: 0.1-0.2 micron filters remove protozoa and bacteria (99.99%+), 0.02 micron removes viruses. Improvised filters remove sediment only - must combine with boiling/chemical treatment. Filter first, then disinfect for maximum safety.

## Filter Effectiveness by Pore Size

| Pore Size | Removes | Typical Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1-5 micron | Sediment, some protozoa | Pre-filter only |
| 0.2-1 micron | Sediment, protozoa, bacteria | Most field filters |
| 0.02-0.1 micron | + Viruses | Advanced/hollow fiber |
| <0.01 micron | All pathogens | Reverse osmosis |

## Commercial Filter Comparison

| Type | Pore Size | Weight | Lifespan | Cost | Best For |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|------|----------|
| Hollow Fiber (Sawyer) | 0.1μ | 2 oz | 100,000 gal | $20-40 | Solo/light |
| Ceramic (Katadyn) | 0.2μ | 8-12 oz | 13,000 gal | $60-90 | Cleanable |
| Pump (MSR) | 0.1μ | 16-20 oz | 2,000 gal | $90-150 | Groups |
| Gravity (Platypus) | 0.2μ | 10 oz | 1,500 gal | $120 | Camp |

## Improvised Sand Filter Construction

**Layer order (bottom → top):**
1. Cloth barrier (holds materials)
2. Fine gravel - 2 inches
3. Coarse gravel - 2 inches
4. **Sand - 8-12 inches** (primary filtration)
5. Crushed charcoal - 4-6 inches (taste/odor)
6. Top gravel - 2 inches (pre-filter)

**Container:** 5-gal bucket or cut 2-liter bottle  
**Flow rate:** 1 quart per 10-15 minutes  
**Effectiveness:** 90-95% sediment, 50-70% bacteria  
**CRITICAL:** Must boil or chemically treat after filtering

## Treatment Chain for Maximum Safety

**Best practice sequence:**
1. **Pre-filter:** Cloth or settling (removes sediment)
2. **Filter:** Commercial or improvised (removes protozoa/bacteria)
3. **Disinfect:** Boil or chemical (kills viruses + remaining pathogens)

**Total time:** 35-45 minutes for 1 liter  
**Result:** 99.99%+ pathogen removal
