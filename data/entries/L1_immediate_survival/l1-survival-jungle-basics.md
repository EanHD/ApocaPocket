summary: 'Jungle survival challenges: abundant water (but often contaminated), dense vegetation (slow travel, poor visibility), high heat and humidity (exhaustion, heat rash), disease (malaria, dengue,
  infections), dangerous animals. Priorities: water purification, dry shelter, avoiding infections.'
warnings:
- Jungle water is often contaminated with parasites - purify all water
- Fungal infections and foot rot develop quickly in constant moisture - keep feet dry
- Many jungle plants and animals are toxic - do not eat unknown species
- Malaria and dengue mosquitoes are deadly - prevent bites
steps:
- 'WATER: Abundant but contaminated. Boil, filter, or treat. Collect rainwater (cleanest). Vines may have drinkable water (cut high, let drain into container - not all vines are safe).'
- 'SHELTER: Keep dry (constant rain). Elevated platform (off wet ground, away from insects). Thatched roof (palm fronds, large leaves). Hammock if available.'
- 'TRAVEL: Extremely slow (dense vegetation). Use machete or follow animal trails, streams. Navigation difficult (no landmarks, canopy blocks sun/stars). Use compass.'
- 'FIRE: Hard to start (everything is wet). Find dry tinder under bark, in tree hollows. Maintain fire constantly (wet fuel smokes heavily).'
- 'INSECTS: Mosquitoes, leeches, ants, ticks. Cover skin, use repellent if available, check for leeches daily. Sleep under mosquito net.'
- 'DISEASE: Malaria, dengue, parasites, bacterial infections. Prevent mosquito bites, purify water, keep wounds clean. Seek medical care if fever or illness develops.'
