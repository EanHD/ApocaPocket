# Building Structural Assessment - Damage Recognition

## Overview

**Entering a structurally compromised building is the #1 cause of death in post-disaster urban environments.** According to FEMA, **60-70% of post-earthquake deaths occur AFTER the initial event** from secondary collapse, not the earthquake itself.

**Your goal:** Determine if a building is safe to enter within 5-15 minutes using rapid visual assessment techniques (no engineering degree required).

**Three safety categories:**
- **GREEN (Inspected):** Safe to occupy normally
- **YELLOW (Limited Entry):** Enter briefly for critical items only (<15 min), avoid upper floors
- **RED (Unsafe):** DO NOT ENTER under any circumstances

**Critical principle:** When in doubt, mark it RED. No resource inside is worth your life.

## FEMA Rapid Assessment Protocol (5-Point Check)

### 1. Building Lean Assessment (60-90 seconds)

**Vertical alignment check:**

**From 50-100 feet away:**
- Stand perpendicular to building face
- Hold pen/stick vertically at arm's length (as plumb line reference)
- Compare building edge to your vertical reference

**Measurements:**
- **<1° lean (invisible to eye):** SAFE - normal tolerance
- **1-2° lean (barely visible):** CAUTION - monitor for changes
- **3-5° lean (clearly visible):** YELLOW - enter only if critical, evacuation plan ready
- **>5° lean (obvious, alarming):** RED - DO NOT ENTER, collapse imminent

**Visual approximation:**
- 1° lean = 1.75 inches per 10 feet of height (difficult to see)
- 3° lean = 5.2 inches per 10 feet (clearly visible, concerning)
- 5° lean = 8.7 inches per 10 feet (severe, obvious danger)

**Additional lean indicators:**
- Doors/windows no longer square (trapezoidal shape)
- Gap between wall and door frame (daylight visible)
- Furniture inside appears tilted (visible through windows)

**Collapse timeframe:**
- 3-5° lean: May collapse in hours to days (aftershocks, wind, further degradation)
- >5° lean: May collapse within minutes to hours (IMMEDIATE DANGER)

---

### 2. Foundation Inspection (90-120 seconds)

**Walk building perimeter, examine foundation:**

#### Settlement Patterns

**Uniform settlement (building sinking evenly):**
- Entire building lower than adjacent structures
- Cracks in ground around perimeter (circumferential)
- **Risk level:** MEDIUM - building stable but sinking (long-term issue, not immediate collapse)

**Differential settlement (one side sinking more than other):**
- One corner lower (building tilted)
- Diagonal cracks in walls (running from low side to high side)
- **Risk level:** HIGH - creates shear stress, may collapse

#### Foundation Cracks

**Width matters:**
- **Hairline (<1/16 inch):** SAFE - cosmetic, no structural concern
- **Narrow (1/16 - 1/4 inch):** CAUTION - monitor for widening
- **Wide (1/4 - 1/2 inch):** YELLOW - structural concern, limited entry
- **Very wide (>1/2 inch):** RED - severe damage, do not enter

**Direction matters:**
- **Vertical cracks:** Usually less serious (concrete shrinkage, minor settling)
- **Horizontal cracks:** SERIOUS - indicates lateral pressure (soil, water, seismic)
- **Diagonal cracks (45°):** VERY SERIOUS - shear failure, structural distress

#### Water Infiltration

**Signs:**
- Water pooling next to foundation (undermining)
- Daylight visible through foundation (holes, gaps)
- Foundation "bowing" inward (soil pressure from outside)

**Risk:** Water undermines foundation → uneven support → collapse

**Timeline:** Collapse within days to weeks (not immediate unless already leaning)

---

### 3. Wall Integrity Assessment (2-3 minutes)

**Load-bearing walls (exterior walls, some interior walls):**
- Support roof, upper floors
- Failure = partial or total collapse

#### Crack Patterns

**X-pattern cracks (shear cracks):**
- Diagonal cracks crossing each other (looks like "X")
- Indicates twisting or racking (earthquake, wind, settlement)
- **Risk:** HIGH - wall losing integrity
- **Action:** RED rating, do not enter

**Stair-step cracks (masonry buildings):**
- Cracks follow mortar joints (between bricks/blocks)
- Indicates settling or shifting
- **Width <1/4 inch:** YELLOW (monitor)
- **Width >1/4 inch:** RED (do not enter)

**Vertical cracks:**
- Top to bottom, straight line
- Usually less serious (shrinkage, minor settling)
- **Width <1/4 inch:** SAFE
- **Width >1/4 inch:** CAUTION

**Horizontal cracks:**
- Side to side (especially mid-height of wall)
- SERIOUS - indicates bending or lateral pressure
- **Any width >1/8 inch:** RED

#### Bulging or Bowing Walls

**Outward bulge:**
- Wall curves outward (from inside pressure)
- Caused by: Roof pushing out, internal pressure, loss of support
- **Visible bulge (>2 inches):** RED - wall may collapse outward

**Inward bow:**
- Wall curves inward (from outside pressure)
- Caused by: Soil pressure, water pressure, structural failure
- **Visible bow (>2 inches):** RED - wall may collapse inward

**How to measure:**
- Stand at corner, look along wall length (like sighting down a rifle barrel)
- Straight = good, curved = danger

#### Separation from Adjacent Structures

**Row houses, townhomes, duplexes:**
- Gap between your building and neighbor's building (should be touching)
- **Gap >1 inch:** YELLOW - buildings moved independently
- **Gap >3 inches:** RED - severe structural movement

---

### 4. Roof and Upper Floor Assessment (2-3 minutes)

#### Roof Sagging

**From street level, look at roofline:**
- Straight horizontal line = SAFE
- Slight dip or sag (<2 inches) = CAUTION
- Pronounced sag (>6 inches, "U" or "V" shape) = RED

**Sagging indicates:**
- Roof structure (rafters, trusses) damaged or failing
- Snow/debris overload (weight exceeding design)
- Fire damage (weakened wooden beams)

**Collapse timeframe:**
- Visible sag: May collapse in hours to days
- Sag + cracking sounds: May collapse in minutes (EVACUATE)

#### Roof Debris Accumulation

**Debris weight calculations:**
- **Snow:** 10-20 lbs per cubic foot (wet snow heavier)
- **Water:** 62 lbs per cubic foot (pooling on flat roof)
- **HVAC unit:** 200-1,000 lbs (if shifted, may overload one area)

**Flat roof safety:**
- Designed for 20-40 lbs per square foot (varies by code)
- 6 inches of water = 31 lbs per sq ft (approaching design limit)
- 12 inches of wet snow = 40-60 lbs per sq ft (EXCEEDS design limit)

**Red flags:**
- Standing water (>3 inches deep, not draining)
- Dislodged HVAC or solar panels (shifted position)
- Roof membrane torn or peeled back (visible from ground)

#### Porch/Balcony/Fire Escape Collapse

**These structures fail FIRST:**
- Attached but not fully integrated (weaker connection)
- Exposed to weather (rust, rot, decay)
- Lightweight construction (designed for minimal load)

**Inspection:**
- Look from below (cracks where attached to building)
- Sag or tilt (not level anymore)
- Rust (metal structures), rot (wooden structures)
- Pull-away (gap between porch and building)

**Do NOT use if:**
- Visible rust or rot (structural members)
- Sag >2 inches
- Cracks at attachment points (>1/8 inch)
- Creaking or groaning sounds when stepped on

---

### 5. Interior Hazards (3-5 minutes if entering)

**Only assess interior if building passes exterior checks (GREEN or YELLOW).**

#### Floor Integrity

**Entry protocol:**
1. Stand in doorway, visually scan floor (holes, damage, debris)
2. Test floor near doorway (step with one foot, keep weight on back foot)
3. Look for bounce or give (should be solid)
4. Listen for cracking (wood fibers breaking)
5. If solid, proceed slowly (test each step)

**Red flags:**
- Floor sagging (visible depression)
- Soft spots (floor gives under weight)
- Cracking sounds (wood breaking)
- Water damage (staining, visible mold, spongy feel)

**Fire-damaged floors:**
- Charred beams (black, flaky surface)
- 50% char depth = 50% strength loss
- If beam 6 inches thick, 3 inches charred = UNSAFE

#### Ceiling Stability

**Look up:**
- Ceilings tiles missing or hanging (indicates movement)
- Water staining (indicates leak, rot above)
- Visible sagging (plaster or drywall drooping)
- Cracks (especially if wet, indicates active damage)

**Hazard:**
- Ceiling collapse (sudden, no warning)
- Exposes upper floor instability

**If ceiling appears damaged:**
- Do not walk directly underneath
- Avoid center of rooms (most sag, weakest point)
- Stay near walls and doorways (stronger support)

#### Stairway Safety

**Before using stairs:**
1. Visual inspection (cracks, missing steps, sag)
2. Sound test (stomp on first step from landing, listen for cracks)
3. Handrail test (shake handrail, should be firm)

**Red flags:**
- Stringers (side supports) cracked or pulling away
- Steps sagging in middle (not level)
- Entire stairway sagging (U-shape)
- Creaking or groaning under light weight

**Alternate route:**
- If stairs unsafe, use ladder (if available)
- Or abandon upper floors (not worth the risk)

## Earthquake-Specific Damage Indicators

### Seismic Damage Patterns

**Post-earthquake, look for:**

#### Shear Cracks
- Diagonal cracks (45° angle) in walls
- Indicates building twisted during shaking
- **Brick/masonry:** Stair-step pattern (following mortar joints)
- **Concrete:** Diagonal cracks (straight through material)
- **Severity:**
  - Cracks <1/4 inch: YELLOW (minor damage)
  - Cracks >1/4 inch: RED (major structural damage)

#### Soft-Story Collapse
- First floor collapses, upper floors intact ("pancake collapse")
- Common in buildings with open first floor (parking, retail)
- **Indicators:**
  - First floor shorter than it should be (compressed)
  - Upper floors tilted or sagging
  - Doors/windows on first floor crushed (shorter opening)
- **Risk:** Total collapse imminent, DO NOT ENTER

#### Foundation Offset
- Foundation cracked and shifted (visible gap or offset)
- One side of foundation moved relative to other side
- **Offset >1 inch:** RED - building no longer on stable foundation

#### Pounding Damage (Adjacent Buildings)
- Two buildings next to each other collided during earthquake
- Damage at contact point (corners crushed, walls caved in)
- Look for: Fresh concrete dust, brick debris at building edges
- **Risk:** Both buildings weakened, may collapse together

### Aftershock Considerations

**Damaged buildings are MORE vulnerable to aftershocks:**
- Already cracked walls = less strength
- Shifted foundation = less stability

**Timeline:**
- Major quake (M7.0+) → aftershocks for weeks to months
- Each aftershock = additional stress on damaged structure
- **Rule:** If building is YELLOW, exits within 5-10 minutes (before next aftershock)

**Aftershock magnitude:**
- Largest aftershock typically 1-2 magnitudes less than mainshock
- M7.0 mainshock → M5.0-6.0 largest aftershock (still significant)
- Buildings that survived mainshock may NOT survive large aftershock

---

## Fire-Damage Assessment

### Burn Depth and Severity

**Wood structures:**

**Surface char (0-1 inch deep):**
- Black, flaky surface
- Structural member still solid underneath
- **Safety:** SAFE - cosmetic damage only

**Partial char (1-3 inches deep, <50% of member thickness):**
- Charring penetrates into beam/joist
- Remaining wood may be weakened
- **Safety:** YELLOW - limited entry, avoid heavy loads

**Deep char (>3 inches, >50% of member thickness):**
- Majority of beam is charred
- Structural integrity compromised
- **Safety:** RED - collapse risk

**How to test:**
- Poke charred wood with knife or screwdriver
- If flakes off easily, reveals solid wood underneath = SAFE
- If crumbles deeply, beam is "spongy" = UNSAFE

### Steel Structures

**Steel behavior in fire:**
- 1000°F = 50% strength loss (steel glows red)
- 1200°F = 70% strength loss (steel bends easily)
- 1800°F = complete structural failure (steel melts at 2500°F)

**Indicators of heat exposure:**
- **Discoloration:** Blue/purple = 600-800°F, orange/red scale = 900-1200°F
- **Warping/sagging:** Beams curved or drooping (indicates extreme heat)
- **Flaking paint:** Heat causes paint to blister and fall off

**Safety:**
- Visible warping = RED (steel permanently weakened)
- Discoloration only (no warping) = YELLOW (may be weakened)

### Concrete Structures

**Concrete behavior in fire:**
- 600°F = concrete begins to deteriorate (chemical changes)
- 1000°F = spalling (surface explodes off in chunks)
- 1200°F = significant strength loss (50-70%)

**Indicators:**
- **Spalling:** Chunks of concrete missing (exposes rebar)
- **Cracks:** Heat-induced cracks (usually horizontal or spiderweb pattern)
- **Color change:** Pink/red = high heat exposure (>1000°F)
- **Exposed rebar:** Rusted or bent rebar (indicates loss of concrete cover)

**Safety:**
- Spalling + exposed rebar = RED (structural failure likely)
- Surface charring only (no spalling) = YELLOW (limited entry)

---

## Explosive Damage Assessment

### Blast Damage Patterns

**Bombs, gas explosions, industrial accidents:**

**Pressure wave effects:**
- **Primary damage:** Walls blown outward (from inside pressure)
- **Secondary damage:** Debris impact (projectiles)
- **Tertiary damage:** Structural weakening (connections sheared)

**Inspection priorities:**

#### Load-Bearing Walls
- Walls facing blast = most damaged
- Look for: Walls blown outward, missing sections, severe cracks
- **Missing >25% of wall:** RED - no structural support

#### Floor/Ceiling Collapse
- Blast overpressure can shear floor supports
- Look for: Floors sagging, debris piles (collapsed floor above)
- **Any floor collapse visible:** RED - progressive collapse risk

#### Windows and Doors
- Blast pressure shatters windows, blows doors off hinges
- **Safety:** Severe cuts from glass shards (wear boots, gloves)
- **Indicator:** If all windows blown out = significant blast pressure (building likely weakened)

## Environmental Hazards

### Gas Leaks

**Natural gas (methane):**
- **Smell:** Rotten eggs (mercaptan additive)
- **Lighter than air:** Rises, accumulates in upper floors, attics
- **Explosion risk:** 5-15% concentration in air = explosive (spark = ignition)

**Propane:**
- **Smell:** Similar to natural gas (odorant added)
- **Heavier than air:** Sinks, accumulates in basements, low areas
- **Explosion risk:** 2-10% concentration = explosive

**Action if gas smell detected:**
1. Hold breath (do not inhale deeply)
2. Do NOT create spark (no flashlight, phone, light switch)
3. Exit building immediately (walk, don't run - static sparks)
4. Move 200+ feet away, upwind
5. Call gas company or 911 (if phones functional)

### Electrical Hazards

**Downed power lines:**
- Assume ALL lines are live (energized)
- Stay 35+ feet away (electricity can arc through ground)
- Do NOT touch anything touching the line (fence, puddle, debris)

**Interior electrical:**
- Sparking outlets, switches = active power (fire risk)
- Water + electricity = electrocution risk (flooded buildings)
- **Action:** Turn off power at main breaker (if accessible and safe)

### Chemical Spills

**Household chemicals (cleaning supplies, paint, solvents):**
- Ammonia + bleach = toxic chlorine gas (fatal)
- Gasoline vapors = explosive (spark = fireball)

**Industrial chemicals:**
- Unknown containers = assume toxic
- Vapors, fumes, strong odors = evacuate immediately

**Protection:**
- Respirator (P100 filter) or N95 minimum
- Eye protection (goggles)
- Gloves (chemical-resistant)
- If symptoms (burning, nausea, dizziness) = exit immediately

---

## Tagging System (FEMA ATC-20)

**Mark assessed buildings with spray paint (on door or wall near entrance):**

### GREEN - Inspected (Safe)

**Large green box with "INSPECTED" inside**
- Safe to occupy
- No restrictions
- Re-inspect after aftershocks or further degradation

### YELLOW - Limited Entry (Restricted Use)

**Large yellow box with "LIMITED ENTRY" inside**
- Enter ONLY for critical items (rescue, medicine, documents)
- Time limit: 15 minutes maximum
- No more than 2-3 people
- Have evacuation plan before entering
- Exit immediately if you hear/see: Cracking, shifting, new cracks

### RED - Unsafe (Do Not Enter)

**Large red box with "UNSAFE" inside**
- DO NOT ENTER for ANY reason
- Extreme collapse risk
- Mark with additional details if possible:
  - "LEANING"
  - "GAS LEAK"
  - "FIRE DAMAGE"

**Additional markings (optional):**
- Date of assessment (top of box)
- Assessor initials (bottom of box)
- Specific hazards (inside box): "ROOF COLLAPSE RISK", "SOFT STORY", "GAS"

## Self-Assessment Decision Matrix

**Use this flowchart:**

```
1. Is building leaning >3°?
   YES → RED (Do not enter)
   NO → Continue to #2

2. Are there wide cracks (>1/4") in foundation or walls?
   YES → RED (Do not enter)
   NO → Continue to #3

3. Is roof sagging significantly (>6 inches) or collapsed?
   YES → RED (Do not enter)
   NO → Continue to #4

4. Do you smell gas, chemicals, or see sparking electrical?
   YES → RED (Do not enter)
   NO → Continue to #5

5. Are there X-pattern cracks, bulging walls, or soft-story collapse?
   YES → RED (Do not enter)
   NO → Continue to #6

6. Are there moderate cracks (1/8-1/4"), minor sag, or water damage?
   YES → YELLOW (Limited entry only)
   NO → Continue to #7

7. Building appears structurally sound (minor cosmetic damage only)?
   YES → GREEN (Safe to enter, but be cautious)
```

**Remember: When in doubt, mark it RED.**

---

## Time-Critical Assessment (60-Second Version)

**If you must assess FAST (active danger, fire, threat):**

1. **Lean test:** Building leaning? → RED
2. **Smell test:** Gas/chemical smell? → RED
3. **Sound test:** Cracking/groaning sounds? → RED
4. **Wall test:** Bulging/cracks visible? → RED
5. **Roof test:** Sagging/collapsed? → RED

**If all NO:** YELLOW (Limited entry, but get out fast)

---

## Post-Assessment Actions

### If GREEN (Safe):
- Enter normally
- Still monitor for changes (new cracks, sounds)
- Re-assess daily (degradation can occur over time)

### If YELLOW (Limited Entry):
- Plan entry: What do you NEED? (water, medicine, documents)
- Time limit: 15 minutes max
- Buddy system: One person inside, one outside watching
- Exit plan: Fastest route out, clear path
- Signal: Whistle or shout if collapse begins
- Re-assess exterior before entering (conditions may have worsened)

### If RED (Unsafe):
- Do NOT enter
- Mark building clearly (spray paint RED "X")
- Inform neighbors/authorities (if communications functional)
- If someone is trapped inside: Call 911 / organized rescue (don't attempt rescue yourself - two casualties worse than one)

---

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| "I'll just run in and grab one thing" | Even 30 seconds = collapse risk, not worth it |
| Ignoring lean (looks minor) | 3° lean = imminent collapse, evacuate |
| Entering despite gas smell (holding breath) | Gas = explosion risk, one spark = death |
| Trusting building because it survived initial event | Aftershocks, degradation = delayed collapse |
| Going upstairs (valuables on 2nd floor) | Upper floors = highest risk, ground floor only |
| Assessing alone (no one to call for help) | Buddy system always (one watches, one enters) |
| Re-entering after initial exit (forgot phone) | NEVER re-enter (increased collapse risk each entry) |
| Assuming concrete = safe | Fire-damaged concrete = weakened, spalling = danger |

---

## When to Call Professionals

**Structural engineers needed if:**
- Building is YELLOW but you need long-term occupancy (repair assessment)
- Insurance claim (documentation of damage)
- Major repairs (permits, code compliance)

**Rescue teams needed if:**
- Person trapped inside RED building
- Collapse in progress (active rescue)

**Do NOT attempt rescue yourself unless:**
- You are trained (CERT, firefighter, search & rescue)
- You have proper equipment (shoring, lifting bags, etc.)
- No professional help available AND person will die without immediate action
