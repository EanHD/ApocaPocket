summary: 'Arctic survival priorities: stay warm, build insulated shelter, avoid frostbite, maintain fire, conserve energy. Cold (below -20F) kills fast. Wind chill multiplies cold danger. Layered clothing,
  windproof outer layer, insulated shelter essential.'
warnings:
- Frostbite can occur in minutes at -20F with wind
- Touching metal with bare skin causes instant freeze injury
- Wet clothing loses insulation - stay dry or change immediately
- Sweating in cold is dangerous - remove layers before overheating
steps:
- 'SHELTER: Insulated from ground and wind. Snow cave (dig into snowbank, smooth ceiling to prevent drips), igloo (requires practice), debris hut (see entry). Smaller shelter = easier to heat with body
  warmth.'
- 'FIRE: Essential for warmth, melting snow for water, cooking. Collect large supply of dry wood (wet wood will not burn). Build fire on platform (prevents melting into snow). Keep fire going constantly.'
- 'CLOTHING: Layer system. Base (wicking layer - wool or synthetic), mid (insulation - fleece, down), outer (windproof, waterproof). Avoid cotton (loses insulation when wet). Cover all skin (frostbite risk).'
- 'WATER: Melt snow or ice (do NOT eat snow - cools body, causes dehydration). Boiling snow for water consumes lots of fuel. Collect ice (less fuel to melt than snow).'
- 'FROSTBITE PREVENTION: Cover face, hands, feet. Move fingers and toes regularly. Check for numbness (early frostbite sign). Warm affected areas immediately (skin-to-skin, not fire).'
- 'CONSERVE ENERGY: Cold increases calorie needs. Eat high-fat foods. Limit exertion. Sweat cools you dangerously.'

# Arctic Survival — Cold, Shelter, Fire, Frostbite

Arctic survival priorities: stay warm, build insulated shelter, avoid frostbite, maintain fire, conserve energy. Cold (below -20F) kills fast. Wind chill multiplies cold danger. Layered clothing, windproof outer layer, insulated shelter essential.
