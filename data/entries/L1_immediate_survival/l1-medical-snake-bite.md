summary: 'Venomous snake bites are painful, frightening, but rarely fatal IF treated correctly. North America: rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths, coral snakes. Key principles: keep calm, immobilize,
  get to medical care. DO NOT cut, suck, tourniquet, or apply ice.'
warnings:
- Most snake bite deaths result from INCORRECT treatment (tourniquets, cutting, delay) not the venom itself
- 30% of venomous snake bites are 'dry' (no venom injected) — don't panic immediately
- Coral snake venom is neurotoxic and delays symptom onset — treat as serious even if patient feels fine initially
- Children and small adults are at higher risk — same venom dose in smaller body
steps:
- 'IMMEDIATE (first 60 seconds): MOVE AWAY from the snake (it may strike again). Sit or lie down. STAY CALM — panic increases heart rate which spreads venom faster. Remove jewelry, tight clothing near bite
  (swelling will occur).'
- 'ASSESS THE BITE: Two puncture wounds = venomous (fangs). Single row of teeth marks = non-venomous. BUT: treat all snake bites as potentially venomous until proven otherwise. IDENTIFY SNAKE if safe (take
  photo, remember color/pattern) — helps medical treatment. DO NOT try to catch or kill the snake.'
- 'IMMOBILIZE THE LIMB: If bite is on arm/leg, immobilize it with a splint (see splinting entry). Keep limb at or slightly below heart level. DO NOT elevate above heart (increases systemic spread). DO NOT
  keep below heart excessively (increases local tissue damage).'
- 'WHAT TO DO: (1) Keep victim still and calm. (2) Immobilize bitten limb. (3) Mark the edge of swelling with a pen every 15 minutes (shows spread). (4) Remove rings, watches before swelling becomes severe.
  (5) Evacuate to medical care ASAP — antivenom is the only definitive treatment. (6) Monitor for shock (see shock entry).'
- 'WHAT NOT TO DO: (1) NO cutting the bite and sucking — increases infection, doesn''t remove venom. (2) NO tourniquet — causes tissue death and can result in amputation. (3) NO ice or cold packs — worsens
  tissue damage. (4) NO alcohol or stimulants. (5) NO electric shock (folklore ''cure'' — doesn''t work). (6) DO NOT try to catch the snake.'
- 'PRESSURE IMMOBILIZATION (Australian method — for coral snakes and neurotoxic snakes ONLY, NOT for pit vipers like rattlesnakes): Wrap entire limb firmly (like an elastic bandage for a sprain) from bite
  site toward heart. Then splint. This slows lymphatic spread of neurotoxins. CHECK: fingertip pulse should still be present. If used on pit viper venom, it concentrates venom locally and worsens tissue
  damage.'
- 'SYMPTOMS TO WATCH: LOCAL: pain, swelling, bruising, blistering at bite site. SYSTEMIC (venom spreading): nausea, vomiting, weakness, difficulty breathing, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty
  swallowing (neurotoxic), tingling around mouth, bleeding from gums/nose. TIME: pit viper symptoms develop in 15-60 minutes. Coral snake symptoms can delay 12+ hours.'
- 'IF NO MEDICAL CARE AVAILABLE: (1) Immobilize and rest for 24-48 hours. (2) Treat pain (ibuprofen, not aspirin — aspirin worsens bleeding). (3) Keep hydrated. (4) Watch for infection (bite wound becomes
  infected in 24-48 hours if not treated). (5) Most patients survive even without antivenom if they rest and avoid exertion. (6) If breathing difficulty develops, this is life-threatening — consider rescue
  breathing.'
- 'PREVENTION: (1) Wear boots and long pants in snake country. (2) Watch where you step and reach. (3) Use a stick to move logs/rocks before reaching. (4) Snakes are most active at dawn/dusk. (5) Sleep
  off the ground if possible. (6) Snakes avoid humans — most bites occur when people step on or attempt to handle snakes.'
