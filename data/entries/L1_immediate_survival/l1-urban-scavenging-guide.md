# Urban Scavenging Guide - Safe Salvage Operations

## Overview

**In extended grid-down or disaster scenarios, abandoned buildings contain critical supplies: food, water, medical supplies, tools, clothing, fuel.** However, **unsafe scavenging kills more survivors than starvation in the first 30 days post-disaster.**

**Primary dangers:**
- Structural collapse (60% of scavenging deaths)
- Hazardous materials (chemical, biological, radiological)
- Violence (territorial conflicts, theft)
- Injury without medical access (cuts, falls, infections)

**Survival principle:** NO resource is worth your life. If a building feels unsafe, IT IS. Move to next target.

**Legal note:** In disasters, property laws become ambiguous. Prioritize life over legality, but be prepared for consequences when order returns.

---

## Pre-Scavenge Planning (10-20 minutes)

### Target Selection

**High-value, low-risk buildings:**
1. **Convenience stores / small groceries** (1-2 stories, simple structure)
2. **Pharmacies** (medical supplies, first aid)
3. **Hardware stores** (tools, batteries, duct tape)
4. **Gas stations** (water, snacks, maps, lighters)
5. **Office buildings** (vending machines, first aid kits, supplies)

**Medium-value, medium-risk:**
1. **Residential homes** (food, clothing, blankets)
2. **Schools** (cafeteria food, medical supplies, tools)
3. **Gyms** (water, protein bars, first aid)

**Low-value or high-risk (AVOID):**
1. **Warehouses** (large open spaces = collapse risk)
2. **Strip malls** (fire damage common, structural instability)
3. **Multi-story parking garages** (concrete failure, collapse)
4. **Industrial sites** (chemical hazards, no food/water)

### Recon from Outside (5 minutes)

**Walk perimeter, assess from ALL sides:**
- [ ] Visible structural damage (cracks, leaning, collapsed sections)
- [ ] Fire damage (charred walls, broken windows, smoke smell)
- [ ] Other scavengers inside (voices, flashlights, movement)
- [ ] Easy exit routes (multiple doors/windows, not blocked)
- [ ] Safe approach (no downed power lines, gas leaks, debris fields)

**Red flags (DO NOT ENTER):**
- Leaning walls (>5° tilt visible)
- Smoke or chemical smell
- "X" marking on door (FEMA search marking = structural assessment done)
  - Quadrant markings: Date, hazards, victims inside/outside
  - Orange/Red X = UNSAFE
- Sound of cracking, groaning, or settling
- Other armed groups inside

**Green lights (SAFER to enter):**
- Minor cosmetic damage (broken windows, graffiti)
- Single-story construction (less collapse risk)
- Wood frame (lighter debris if collapse vs concrete)
- Multiple visible exits
- No signs of occupation (no vehicles, no smoke, no guards)

### Safety Gear (mandatory minimum)

- **Sturdy boots** (steel toe preferred, thick sole for nails/glass)
- **Heavy gloves** (leather work gloves, not cotton)
- **Dust mask / N95** (asbestos, mold, smoke particulates)
- **Flashlight** (headlamp preferred, hands-free)
- **Whistle** (signal for help if trapped, 3 blasts = SOS)
- **Crowbar / pry bar** (door entry, debris removal, self-defense)
- **First aid kit** (bandages, antiseptic, tourniquet)
- **Water bottle** (16 oz minimum, dehydration impairs judgment)

**Optional but valuable:**
- Hard hat (falling debris protection)
- Safety goggles (dust, chemicals)
- Respirator (better than N95 for chemical/gas)
- Rope (15-25 ft, climbing out of holes/windows)
- Buddy (ALWAYS safer in pairs - one watches, one searches)

---

## Building Safety Assessment (5-10 minutes)

### The 5-Point Structural Check

**Perform BEFORE entering, then RE-CHECK every 15 minutes inside.**

#### 1. Foundation (60 seconds)

**Check:**
- Cracks in foundation (>1/4" wide = serious)
- Gaps between foundation and walls
- Tilting or settling (one side lower than other)

**Safe:** Solid, level, no visible cracks  
**Unsafe:** Cracking, tilting, gaps, water pooling (undermining)

#### 2. Load-Bearing Walls (90 seconds)

**Exterior walls (usually load-bearing):**
- Vertical cracks (especially near corners)
- Horizontal cracks (VERY serious, indicates wall failure)
- Bulging or bowing outward (wall losing integrity)

**Interior walls (some load-bearing, some not):**
- Wall runs perpendicular to floor joists = likely load-bearing
- Cracks running through wall and ceiling = structural concern

**Safe:** No cracks or only hairline cracks (<1/16")  
**Unsafe:** Cracks >1/4", bulging, leaning, crumbling

#### 3. Roof & Ceiling (60 seconds)

**From outside:**
- Sagging roof (looks like a "U" or "V" shape)
- Missing sections (holes, collapsed areas)
- Heavy debris on roof (air conditioning units, solar panels shifted)

**From inside (once entered):**
- Ceiling tiles missing, water damage, sagging
- Exposed beams cracked or splintered
- Creaking sounds (stressed structure)

**Safe:** Solid, level, no sagging  
**Unsafe:** Sagging, holes, visible damage, sounds of stress

#### 4. Floor Integrity (90 seconds)

**Before stepping fully inside:**
- Tap floor with crowbar or stick (listen for hollow sound)
- Check for soft spots (floor gives under weight)
- Look for holes, missing floorboards

**Safe:** Solid, no give, no holes  
**Unsafe:** Bouncing, soft, holes, cracking sounds

**NEVER trust:**
- Floors with water damage (rot, weakness)
- Floors in fire-damaged buildings (beams burned through)
- Floors over basements/crawl spaces (collapse risk)

#### 5. Hazard Scan (60 seconds)

**Look/smell/listen for:**
- Gas smell (rotten eggs, chemical odor) → EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY
- Electrical sparking or buzzing → AVOID area, may still be powered
- Chemical smell (sweet, acrid, bleach-like) → EVACUATE
- Downed power lines (inside or near building) → UNSAFE
- Animal sounds (rats, stray dogs, wild animals) → CAUTION

**Safe:** No unusual smells, sounds, or visible hazards  
**Unsafe:** Any of the above present

---

## Entry Protocol

### Door Entry (2-5 minutes)

**1. Check door (don't open yet):**
- Locked? (Crowbar or kick, but loud = attracts attention)
- Damaged? (Fire damage, splintered, hanging on hinges)
- Warm/hot? (Fire or heat inside)

**2. Listen at door (30 seconds):**
- Voices, footsteps, barking (others inside)
- Cracking, groaning (structural instability)
- Hissing (gas leak)

**3. Knock or announce (optional - tactical decision):**
- If you want to AVOID confrontation: Announce loudly ("Anyone inside? We're entering for supplies!")
- If you want STEALTH: Silent entry (but risk surprise encounter)

**4. Open slowly:**
- Stand to SIDE of door (not in front - gunfire risk, debris risk)
- Push open with foot or crowbar (hands free)
- Let door swing fully open, wait 10 seconds (smell, sound check)

**5. Visual sweep:**
- Shine flashlight inside (left to right, ceiling to floor)
- Look for immediate hazards (holes in floor, fire, people)
- Check for exit routes (back door, windows)

### Window Entry (if door blocked/locked)

**When to use:**
- Door inaccessible (blocked, locked, trapped)
- Stealth needed (windows quieter than kicking doors)

**Method:**
1. Break glass with crowbar or rock wrapped in cloth (muffles sound)
2. Clear glass from frame (use crowbar, don't use hands)
3. Lay cloth or cardboard over frame (prevents cuts)
4. Climb through feet-first (faster exit if needed)

**Caution:**
- Two-story windows = fall risk (only enter ground level unless fire escape)
- Broken glass on floor inside (wear boots, watch footing)

---

## Room-by-Room Search Pattern

### Systematic Search (prevents wasted time, missed items)

**Strategy: Grid search, starting from entry point, spiraling outward.**

1. **Entry room first** (nearest door/window = fastest exit if needed)
2. **Kitchen** (food, water, utensils, cleaning supplies)
3. **Bathrooms** (medicine cabinet, toiletries, water in tank)
4. **Bedrooms** (clothing, blankets, personal items)
5. **Garage/basement** (tools, fuel, hardware) - ONLY if structurally safe
6. **Living areas last** (lowest value typically)

**Mark searched rooms:**
- Chalk or spray paint "X" on door (prevents re-searching)
- Note date and your initials (track your own progress)

### Time Limits (discipline prevents greed trap)

**Per room:**
- Small room (bathroom, closet): 5 minutes max
- Medium room (bedroom, kitchen): 10 minutes max
- Large room (living room, garage): 15 minutes max

**Total building time: 30-60 minutes MAXIMUM.**

**Why strict timing:**
- Structural degradation (time in building = increased collapse risk)
- Attention from others (long stay = more likely to be spotted)
- Diminishing returns (best items found in first 10 minutes)

**Set alarm on watch/phone:** When it goes off, LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. No exceptions.

## High-Value Items Checklist

### Survival Priority (Grab FIRST)

**Tier 1: Life-sustaining (0-10 minutes)**
- [ ] **Water** (bottled, canned, toilet tanks if no chemicals)
- [ ] **Non-perishable food** (canned goods, dried, vacuum-sealed)
- [ ] **Medicine** (antibiotics, pain relievers, insulin, EpiPens)
- [ ] **First aid supplies** (bandages, gauze, antiseptic, tape)
- [ ] **Flashlight / batteries** (illumination, signaling)

**Tier 2: Comfort & utility (10-20 minutes)**
- [ ] **Clothing** (seasonal appropriate, sturdy boots, warm layers)
- [ ] **Blankets / sleeping bags** (hypothermia prevention)
- [ ] **Fire-starting** (lighters, matches, flint)
- [ ] **Tools** (knife, multi-tool, duct tape, rope)
- [ ] **Hygiene items** (soap, toilet paper, toothpaste, feminine products)

**Tier 3: Long-term value (20-30 minutes)**
- [ ] **Fuel** (propane, kerosene, gasoline - STORE SAFELY)
- [ ] **Hardware** (nails, screws, wood, tarps)
- [ ] **Books / maps** (knowledge, navigation)
- [ ] **Electronics** (radios, solar chargers, batteries)

**Do NOT waste time on:**
- Electronics without power (TVs, computers, gaming consoles)
- Perishable food (meat, dairy unless you can eat immediately)
- Bulky furniture (not worth carry weight vs value)
- Sentimental items (photos, trophies) unless very small/light

### Carry Capacity Planning

**Average adult can carry:**
- **Short distance (< 1 mile):** 50-70 lbs
- **Medium distance (1-5 miles):** 30-40 lbs
- **Long distance (5+ miles):** 20-30 lbs

**Prioritize by weight-to-value:**
- **Best:** Antibiotics (ounces, extreme value)
- **Good:** Canned food (heavy but calorie-dense)
- **Okay:** Tools (heavy, but reusable)
- **Poor:** Water (very heavy, can find elsewhere)

**Use containers:**
- Backpack (hands-free, best option)
- Duffel bag or trash bag (can carry more, awkward)
- Cart or wagon (if traveling <1 mile, paved roads)

---

## Hazard Recognition & Response

### Structural Hazards

#### Imminent Collapse Warnings

**EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY if you hear/see:**
- Loud cracking or popping sounds (beams failing)
- Ceiling tiles falling (roof losing integrity)
- Floor suddenly sagging or bouncing (joists failing)
- New cracks appearing (progressive failure)
- Dust clouds (friction from shifting structure)

**Evacuation speed:** Drop items, run to nearest exit, 10-15 seconds max.

#### Floor Collapse

**If floor gives way:**
1. Spread weight (lie flat if starting to crack)
2. Roll toward wall or solid object (distribute load)
3. Crawl to exit (don't stand, concentrates weight)

**If someone falls through:**
- Don't jump in after them (you'll fall too)
- Call for help (they may be injured, conscious but trapped)
- Lower rope or extend pole (pull them up if able)

#### Stairway Collapse

**Test stairs before full weight:**
1. Step on edge of stair (near wall, strongest point)
2. Apply half weight, test for give or cracking
3. If solid, proceed carefully (one person at a time)

**Avoid:**
- Center of stairs (weakest point, most sag)
- Running or jumping (impact = failure)
- Carrying heavy loads up/down (increases stress on stairs)

### Chemical Hazards

#### Gas Leaks

**Smell rotten eggs, sulfur, or chemical odor:**
1. Hold breath (don't inhale deeply)
2. Walk (don't run - static sparks can ignite)
3. Exit building immediately
4. Move 200+ feet away, upwind
5. Do NOT use phone, flashlight, or create any spark near building

**Natural gas:** Lighter than air (rises, accumulates in upper floors/attic)  
**Propane:** Heavier than air (sinks, accumulates in basements)

#### Asbestos & Mold

**Older buildings (pre-1980s):**
- Asbestos in insulation, ceiling tiles, floor tiles
- Looks like white/gray fluffy material or crumbly ceiling tiles
- **Danger:** Long-term lung cancer, asbestosis

**Water-damaged buildings:**
- Mold (black, green, white fuzzy patches)
- Smells musty, damp, earthy
- **Danger:** Respiratory illness, allergic reactions, infections

**Protection:**
- N95 mask minimum (filters 95% of particles)
- Respirator preferred (P100 filters 99.97%)
- Avoid disturbing (don't break tiles, don't kick insulation)

#### Chemicals & Cleaners

**Commercial buildings (offices, stores, schools):**
- Cleaning supplies (bleach, ammonia, acids)
- If mixed (bleach + ammonia = toxic chlorine gas)
- Look for spills, broken containers

**Home garages / basements:**
- Paint, solvents, pesticides, antifreeze
- Even small amounts = toxic in enclosed space

**Signs of exposure:**
- Burning eyes, nose, throat
- Difficulty breathing
- Nausea, dizziness, confusion

**Response:**
- Exit immediately
- Fresh air for 15-30 minutes
- If symptoms persist, seek medical help
- Don't re-enter building

### Biological Hazards

#### Sewage & Waste

**After flooding or plumbing failure:**
- Sewage backup (contains E. coli, hepatitis, parasites)
- Brown water, fecal smell
- **Danger:** Infection through cuts, ingestion, inhalation

**Protection:**
- Waterproof boots (waders if deep)
- Gloves (rubber, no tears)
- Avoid touching face, eating, drinking until decontaminated

#### Dead Animals / Bodies

**Decomposition produces:**
- Bacteria, viruses, pathogens
- Gases (methane, ammonia, sulfur compounds)
- Insects (flies, maggots as disease vectors)

**Response:**
- Avoid area (don't approach closer than 10-15 feet)
- Hold breath if must pass (don't inhale deeply)
- Mark location (warn others, inform authorities if functional)
- Decontaminate after (wash hands, face, change clothes)

#### Pests & Vermin

**Rats, mice, roaches:**
- Carry disease (hantavirus, leptospirosis, plague)
- Aggressive if cornered
- Feces and urine = airborne pathogens

**Stray dogs / cats:**
- May be rabid, aggressive, territorial
- Back away slowly (don't turn back, don't run)
- Use crowbar or stick to fend off if charging

---

## Violence & Security

### Threat Assessment

**Signs of hostile presence:**
- Voices, footsteps (inside or outside)
- Vehicles nearby (lookout or transport)
- Trash, supplies moved recently (fresh occupancy)
- Weapons visible (stick, pipe, firearm)

**Three responses:**
1. **Avoid:** Leave quietly, find different building
2. **Negotiate:** Announce presence, propose sharing
3. **Defend:** Only if attacked or cornered (last resort)

### Tactical Approach

**If you see others first (you have initiative):**
- Observe from distance (5-10 minutes, hidden position)
- Count people (1 person = possible negotiation, 3+ = avoid)
- Assess weapons, demeanor (calm = negotiable, agitated = danger)
- Decide: Approach, avoid, or wait for them to leave

**If they see you first (they have initiative):**
- Hands visible, non-threatening (show you're not a threat)
- Calm voice: "Just looking for food/water for my family"
- Offer to share (builds rapport)
- Propose split ("You take kitchen, I'll take bathroom?")

**If confrontation escalates:**
- De-escalate: "I'll leave, no problem"
- Back away slowly (face them, watch for attack)
- Drop non-essential items (lighten load for running)
- Run if they advance (survival > pride)

### Self-Defense (Last Resort)

**Only if:**
- You're cornered (no exit available)
- They're attacking (not just threatening)
- Your life or family's life at immediate risk

**Improvised weapons (from scavenging gear):**
- Crowbar (effective club, long reach)
- Knife (if you have one - close quarters, high risk)
- Flashlight (strike to face, temporarily blind)
- Bag of cans (swing it, heavy and surprising)

**Target vulnerable areas:**
- Eyes (poke, scratch, flashlight beam)
- Throat (punch, jab with crowbar)
- Knees (kick side of knee, disables mobility)
- Groin (kick, knee strike)

**After defending:**
- ESCAPE IMMEDIATELY (don't stay to "finish" fight)
- Render aid if you're able and safe (but prioritize your escape)
- Report to authorities if functional (assault, self-defense claim)

## Scavenging Efficiency Matrix

### Time vs Risk vs Value

| Building Type | Time (min) | Risk Level | Avg Value (1-10) | Notes |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------------|-------|
| Convenience store | 15-30 | Medium | 8 | High food/water, may be looted |
| Pharmacy | 20-40 | Medium | 9 | Antibiotics = extreme value, often guarded |
| Hardware store | 30-60 | Low | 7 | Tools heavy, but long-term value |
| Gas station | 10-20 | Low | 6 | Limited food, maps, lighters |
| Single-family home | 20-40 | Low | 6 | Varied supplies, often picked over |
| Office building | 30-60 | Low | 5 | Vending machines, first aid kits |
| Restaurant | 15-30 | Medium | 4 | Perishable food (unless canned goods) |
| School | 40-90 | Medium | 6 | Cafeteria food, large building = more risk |
| Warehouse | 60+ | HIGH | Varies | Collapse risk, avoid unless desperate |

**Optimal strategy:** 3-4 small buildings (convenience store, gas station, home) = less risk than 1 large building (school, warehouse).

---

## Post-Scavenge Protocol

### Decontamination (5-10 minutes)

**Remove contaminated clothing:**
- Strip outer layer outside your shelter (don't bring contaminants home)
- Bag clothing (wash later or discard if heavily contaminated)

**Wash exposed skin:**
- Soap and water (15-30 seconds, thorough scrubbing)
- Focus on hands, face, neck (highest contact areas)
- Use clean water (don't use scavenged water until purified)

**Disinfect gear:**
- Wipe boots, crowbar, backpack with damp cloth
- Soak gloves in bleach solution if used in sewage/hazmat area

### Supply Sorting

**Quarantine suspicious items:**
- Food with damaged packaging (bulging cans, torn bags)
- Medicine past expiration (may be ineffective or harmful)
- Water from unknown source (purify before drinking)

**Immediate use:**
- Perishable food (eat within 24-48 hours)
- Medicine needed urgently (antibiotics if infection present)

**Long-term storage:**
- Canned goods (cool, dark place, rotate stock)
- Tools (clean, oil, organize)
- Clothing (wash, store clean and dry)

### Log Your Scavenge (2-3 minutes)

**Record:**
- Location (address or landmark)
- Date and time
- Items taken (type, quantity)
- Condition of building (safe, marginal, unsafe)
- Threats encountered (people, hazards, animals)

**Why:**
- Prevents re-visiting (wasted time)
- Shares intel (if coordinating with group)
- Legal record (if property claims arise later)

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Entering without safety check | 5-point structural assessment every time |
| Going alone | Buddy system (one watches, one searches) |
| Staying too long (greed) | Set 30-60 min timer, leave when it beeps |
| Taking everything (overloaded) | Prioritize by weight-to-value ratio |
| Ignoring hazard signs (smell, sound) | Exit immediately if red flags |
| No exit plan | Identify 2+ exits before entering |
| Forgetting decontamination | Always wash after scavenging |
| Loud entry (kicking doors) | Quiet entry when possible (stealth) |
| Taking perishable food | Focus on non-perishable (canned, dried) |
| Not marking searched buildings | Mark with "X" to save time later |

---

## When to Abandon Scavenging

**Stop scavenging if:**
- Structural damage increasing (earthquake aftershocks, settling buildings)
- Violence escalating (more armed groups, territorial conflicts)
- You have 3-7 days of supplies (enough to wait for aid/order)
- Supply sources exhausted (everything already looted)
- Too risky vs reward (injuries/death not worth a can of beans)

**Alternative strategies:**
- Trade (exchange skills/items with others)
- Community pooling (share resources, cooperative security)
- Aid distribution (government, NGOs, if functioning)
- Agriculture (grow food if long-term scenario)

---

## Specialized Scavenging Scenarios

### Pharmacies (High-Value, High-Risk)

**Most valuable items:**
1. Antibiotics (amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin)
2. Pain management (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin)
3. Insulin (if diabetic, this is life-critical)
4. EpiPens (anaphylaxis, bee stings, allergies)
5. Wound care (sutures, surgical glue, gauze, tape)

**Likely guarded or looted first:** Expect competition or conflict.

**Strategy:**
- Arrive very early (within 24-48 hours of disaster)
- Off-hours (nighttime, if safe)
- Bring trade goods (offer to share, negotiate)
- In/out FAST (10-15 minutes max)

### Grocery Stores (Medium-Value, Crowded)

**What's left after initial looting:**
- Spices, condiments (low priority but useful)
- Canned vegetables (skipped for meat/bread)
- Baby food, formula (if you need it, often overlooked)
- Pet food (can be eaten by humans if desperate)

**Avoid:**
- Perishable aisles (meat, dairy, produce - rotting, smell, bacteria)
- Electronics aisle (low survival value)
- Checkout area (congestion, fights)

**Focus:**
- Canned goods aisle (back of store usually)
- Water section (if any left)
- Pharmacy area (see above)

### Gas Stations (Low-Value, Quick)

**Useful items:**
- Maps (paper, if phones down)
- Lighters, matches (fire-starting)
- Snacks (chips, jerky, candy bars)
- Small tools (screwdrivers, duct tape)
- Windshield washer fluid (can be purified in extreme emergencies)

**Fuel:**
- Pumps likely non-functional (require power)
- Underground tanks = 5,000-10,000 gallons (but difficult to extract without pump)
- Siphon from cars (hose + gravity, 10-15 gallons per vehicle)

### Homes (Variable Value, Low Risk)

**Respectful approach:**
- If owners present, ask permission (trade, negotiate)
- If clearly abandoned, proceed (but leave a note of what you took)
- Avoid if recently occupied (personal items, family photos = people may return)

**Best areas:**
- Garage (tools, camping gear, fuel)
- Pantry (canned goods, dry goods)
- Bathroom (medicine cabinet, first aid)
- Bedrooms (clothing, blankets)

**Skip:**
- Living room (low value, mostly electronics/furniture)
- Personal items (jewelry, photos) unless truly desperate
