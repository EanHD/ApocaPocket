# Child Water Safety - Drowning Prevention and Rescue

## Overview

**Drowning is the leading cause of death in children ages 1-4 years** (WHO data). In survival situations with compromised water infrastructure, drowning risk increases dramatically: open water sources, flooded areas, makeshift bathing areas.

**Critical facts:**
- Drowning is SILENT (not like movies - no splashing, no screaming)
- Children can drown in <2 minutes, in <6 inches of water
- Brain damage begins at 4-6 minutes without oxygen
- 50% of child drownings happen within 25 feet of an adult who didn't recognize drowning

**This entry covers:** Age-specific drowning risks, supervision protocols, PFD (life jacket) selection and sizing, drowning recognition, and water rescue techniques for children.

**Survival context:** When normal safety infrastructure (pools, fences, lifeguards) is unavailable, knowledge and vigilance are your only defenses.

## Drowning Risk by Age

### Infants (0-12 Months)

**Primary risk locations:**
- Bathtubs (most common)
- Buckets (5-gallon buckets with water/cleaning solution)
- Toilets (if crawling)
- Any container with >2 inches of water

**Why they drown:**
- Top-heavy (large head, weak neck muscles)
- Cannot lift head if face-down in water
- No understanding of danger
- Cannot call for help

**Prevention:**
- **Never leave alone near water** (not for "just a second")
- Empty buckets immediately after use
- Toilet lids closed (or bathroom door closed)
- Bathtub: Drain immediately, don't leave water standing

**Supervision rule:** **ARM'S REACH** - adult within grabbing distance at all times in or near water.

---

### Toddlers (1-3 Years)

**Primary risk locations:**
- Pools (backyard, community)
- Natural bodies of water (ponds, lakes, rivers, ocean)
- Bathtubs
- Buckets, containers
- Flooded areas (post-disaster)

**Why they drown:**
- Curious, no fear
- Cannot swim
- Top-heavy (fall face-first, can't right themselves)
- Silent drowning (don't know to call for help)
- Fast (can reach water in seconds when adult turns away)

**Prevention:**
- **Touch supervision:** Adult within arm's reach at all times
- Fencing around water (4-sided fence with self-closing gate)
- Layers of protection (fence + door alarm + supervision)
- Life jacket on if near water

**Supervision rule:** **TOUCH SUPERVISION** - adult can reach child without moving their feet.

**Critical window:** 50% of toddler drownings happen during "lapse in supervision" (parent checking phone, talking to another adult, went inside "just for a minute")

---

### Young Children (4-9 Years)

**Primary risk locations:**
- Swimming pools
- Open water (lakes, rivers, ocean)
- Boats
- Flood zones

**Why they drown:**
- Overestimate swimming ability
- Peer pressure (attempting dangerous activities)
- Exhaustion (swimming farther than endurance allows)
- Panic (forget skills when scared)
- Currents (undertow, rip currents stronger than swimming ability)

**Prevention:**
- Life jackets on boats and in open water (non-negotiable)
- Swimming lessons (reduces drowning risk by 88% - AAP data)
- Teach water safety rules
- Supervise even if child can swim
- Test swimming ability in safe environment before open water

**Supervision rule:** **CONSTANT VISUAL CONTACT** - designated adult watching child continuously (not reading, not on phone).

---

### Older Children & Teens (10-18 Years)

**Primary risk locations:**
- Open water (lakes, rivers, ocean)
- Unsupervised swimming holes
- Boating accidents
- Flood rescue attempts

**Why they drown:**
- Risk-taking behavior (diving into unknown water, swimming in dangerous conditions)
- Alcohol use (impairs judgment and coordination)
- Overconfidence (swimming too far from shore)
- Attempting to rescue others (become second victim)
- Strong currents underestimated

**Prevention:**
- Life jacket enforcement on boats
- Never swim alone rule
- Education about currents, undertow, cold water
- Teach proper rescue techniques (reach/throw, don't go)
- Alcohol education (alcohol + water = fatal combination)

**Supervision rule:** **BUDDY SYSTEM** - never swim alone, designate watch area if in groups.

## Drowning Recognition - What It Actually Looks Like

**Hollywood drowning:** Splashing, waving arms, yelling "HELP!"  
**Actual drowning:** Silent, motionless, vertical in water

### Instinctive Drowning Response (IDR)

**Body's automatic response to suffocation in water** (discovered by Francesco Pia, 1974):

**What happens:**
1. Mouth sinks below surface, bobs above briefly
2. Cannot call for help (breathing takes priority)
3. Arms instinctively extend laterally (push down to lift mouth for air)
4. Cannot wave for help (involuntary arm movement)
5. Body remains upright (cannot kick or move to safety)
6. Struggle lasts 20-60 seconds, then submerges

**Signs of drowning (Francisco Pia IDR signs):**

| **Drowning Sign** | **What You See** |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **Vertical position** | Body upright in water, not horizontal like swimming |
| **Head back, mouth open** | Tilted back, gasping when mouth above water |
| **Eyes glassy, unfocused** | Cannot focus on you or anything, "thousand-yard stare" |
| **Hair in eyes** | No attempt to clear hair from face (all effort on breathing) |
| **Not using legs** | Vertical, no kicking |
| **Hyperventilating or gasping** | Rapid, shallow breathing when mouth surfaces |
| **Attempting to swim but no progress** | Arm movement but not going anywhere |
| **Attempting to roll to back** | Trying to get mouth above water, failing |

**In children specifically:**
- May appear to be "climbing an invisible ladder" (arms moving up and down)
- Silent (cannot cry for help)
- 20-30 seconds before submersion (shorter than adults)

**Red flag behavior (just before IDR):**
- Child who was playing actively suddenly gets quiet
- Child stops responding to questions
- Child stops making eye contact

### Drowning vs. Aquatic Distress

**Aquatic Distress (NOT drowning yet, but can become drowning):**
- Can call for help ("I'm struggling!" "Help me!")
- Can wave arms voluntarily
- Can respond to questions
- Making forward progress (even if struggling)
- May be able to grab safety equipment if thrown

**Drowning (Instinctive Drowning Response):**
- Cannot call for help (silent)
- Cannot wave voluntarily
- Cannot respond to questions
- No forward progress
- Cannot assist in own rescue

**Response:**
- **Distress:** Throw flotation, guide to safety
- **Drowning:** IMMEDIATE active rescue (they have <60 seconds)

---

## Supervision Protocols by Environment

### Pool Supervision (Backyard, Community)

**Designated Water Watcher:**
- One adult assigned (use wristband or card to designate)
- Only job is watching children in water (no phone, no book, no conversation)
- Rotate every 15-20 minutes (attention fatigue)
- Stand or sit close to water (not across the yard)

**Layers of protection:**
1. **Fencing:** 4-sided isolation fence (not house as 4th side)
   - 4 feet minimum height
   - Vertical bars <4 inches apart (child can't slip through)
   - Self-closing, self-latching gate (latch at adult height)
2. **Alarms:** Door alarm on house exits leading to pool area
3. **Pool cover:** Safety cover (not solar cover - child can slip under and not be seen)
4. **Rescue equipment:** Life hook and flotation device within reach
5. **Supervision:** Designated water watcher

**Post-disaster compromises:**
- If fencing damaged: Physical barrier (furniture, boxes) + increased supervision
- If no alarms: Bells on door handles
- If no pool cover: Extra vigilance

### Open Water Supervision (Lakes, Rivers, Ocean)

**Designated swim area:**
- Clearly defined boundaries (buoys, landmarks, physical markers)
- Check water depth (no drop-offs within swim area)
- Inspect for hazards (rocks, debris, glass, sharp objects)
- Test current strength (float stick - if moves faster than walking pace, too strong)

**Buddy system:**
- Pair children (similar age/ability)
- Check in with buddy every 5 minutes
- Buddy goes to adult together (no solo trips to bathroom, etc.)

**Environmental hazards:**

| Hazard | Recognition | Protocol |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Rip current** | Narrow strip of choppy, discolored water moving seaward | Swim parallel to shore until out of current, then swim to shore |
| **Undertow** | Strong pull of water returning after wave breaks | Swim out of it (parallel to shore) or dive under and let it pass |
| **Cold water** | <70°F (21°C) | Life jackets mandatory, limit time (hypothermia risk) |
| **Fast-moving river** | Current faster than walking pace | No swimming - rescue risk too high |
| **Murky water** | Cannot see bottom | Assume hidden hazards, life jackets, minimal swimming |

**Life jacket rule:** All children under 13 in life jackets in open water (non-negotiable).

### Bathtub Supervision

**Infants/Toddlers (0-3 years):**
- Within arm's reach entire time (touch supervision)
- Water depth maximum 3-4 inches
- Test water temperature (90-100°F / 32-38°C) before placing child in
- Never leave to answer door/phone/other child (bring baby with you)

**Young children (4-6 years):**
- Adult in bathroom, door open
- Water depth below chest when seated
- Check on child every 2-3 minutes

**Older children (7+ years):**
- Adult nearby (within earshot)
- Check periodically
- Teach: If you feel dizzy, sleepy, or "wrong," call immediately

**Common mistake:** "Just for a second" (average drowning time is 2 minutes)

## Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs / Life Jackets)

### PFD Types and Uses

**U.S. Coast Guard Classification:**

| Type | Name | Use | Child Appropriate? |
|------|------|-----|-------------------|
| **Type I** | Offshore life jacket | Open ocean, high waves, unconscious flotation | Yes (turns face-up) |
| **Type II** | Near-shore vest | Calm waters, quick rescue available | Yes (infant/child versions) |
| **Type III** | Flotation aid | Conscious wearer, calm water, active swimming | Yes (most common for kids) |
| **Type IV** | Throwable device | Ring buoys, cushions (throw to victim) | No (not wearable) |
| **Type V** | Special use | Kayaking, water skiing (specific activities) | Some models (check label) |

**For children:** Type II or Type III most common. Type I if going offshore.

**Key difference:**
- **Type II:** Will turn unconscious child face-up (critical if child unresponsive)
- **Type III:** Requires conscious child to keep face above water (more comfortable, allows active swimming)

**Recommendation:** Type II for non-swimmers, Type III for swimmers.

### PFD Sizing Chart (Children)

**Sizing is by WEIGHT, not age** (manufacturers vary - always check label).

| Type | Weight Range | Chest Size (approx) | Fit Test |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Infant** | 0-30 lbs (0-14 kg) | <20 inches (50 cm) | Head support collar, crotch strap mandatory |
| **Child Small** | 30-50 lbs (14-23 kg) | 20-25 inches (50-64 cm) | Cannot slip over head when fastened |
| **Child Medium** | 50-90 lbs (23-41 kg) | 25-29 inches (64-74 cm) | Snug around chest, secure when lifting child by shoulders |
| **Youth** | 90+ lbs (41+ kg) | 29-35 inches (74-89 cm) | Transition to adult sizing if appropriate |

**Fit test (critical):**
1. Child puts on PFD, fasten all straps
2. Adult lifts child by PFD shoulder straps (child's arms raised)
3. **If PFD rides up over child's chin or ears = TOO BIG** (dangerous - child can slip out)
4. Straps should be snug but not restricting breathing

**Common sizing mistake:** Buying PFD child will "grow into" (too large now = ineffective and dangerous)

### Infant PFD Special Requirements

**Must have:**
- **Head/neck support collar** (prevents face-down floating)
- **Crotch strap** (prevents sliding out)
- **Handle on back** (for grabbing child quickly)
- **Bright color** (visibility)

**Position in water:**
- Should float infant on back with face up (not vertical)
- Mouth and nose well above waterline
- Even if infant unconscious

**Test before emergency:**
- Supervised test in shallow water
- Ensure infant floats correctly
- Check for comfort (won't wear it if painful)

### PFD Maintenance and Inspection

**Before each use:**
- [ ] Check for tears, rips, holes
- [ ] Squeeze to ensure foam not compressed/damaged
- [ ] Test zippers, buckles, straps (functional?)
- [ ] Check for mold, rot (smells musty = compromised)
- [ ] Ensure proper size (child hasn't outgrown since last use)

**Replace if:**
- Foam is compressed (doesn't spring back)
- Straps frayed or buckles broken
- Fabric torn
- More than 5 years old (even if looks fine - foam degrades)
- Doesn't pass fit test

**Storage:**
- Dry completely before storing
- Cool, dry location (not in direct sun - UV degrades foam)
- Loosely folded (don't compress)

### Life Jacket Rules

**Non-negotiable rules (enforce consistently):**
1. **Life jacket ON before boarding boat** (not stored on boat "in case")
2. **Fastened properly** (all straps, zippers secure)
3. **Kept on entire time near water** (don't take off when "feel safe")
4. **No swimming under dock or boat while wearing** (can trap you underneath)
5. **One person per PFD** (no sharing)

**Make it positive:**
- Let child pick color/design (more likely to wear)
- Praise consistent use ("Great job putting on your life jacket first!")
- Adults model behavior (wear your PFD too)

**What life jackets DON'T do:**
- ❌ Substitute for supervision (must still watch child)
- ❌ Teach swimming (swimming lessons separate)
- ❌ Make all water activities safe (still need judgment)

## Water Rescue Techniques

### Primary Rule: Reach, Throw, Don't Go

**DO NOT enter water to rescue unless:**
1. You are trained in water rescue
2. You have flotation device
3. There is no other option

**Why:** 50% of drowning deaths are would-be rescuers (become second victim)

### Rescue Sequence

**Step 1: REACH (if victim within 10 feet of shore/edge)**

**Use:**
- Pool skimmer pole
- Tree branch
- Towel (twisted, held at one end)
- Paddle
- Long pipe or board

**Technique:**
1. Lay on stomach at water's edge (prevents being pulled in)
2. Extend object to victim
3. Brace yourself (against solid object if possible)
4. Pull victim to edge

**Communication:** "Grab the [object]! Hold on! I've got you!"

---

**Step 2: THROW (if victim 10-30 feet away)**

**Use:**
- Life ring (with rope attached)
- Rope bag
- Anything that floats (cooler, empty gas can, jug)

**Technique:**
1. Tie rope to fixed object (prevents losing rope)
2. Coil rope, hold half in each hand
3. Throw flotation device PAST victim (rope lands near them)
4. Pull rope to bring flotation to victim
5. Once grabbed, pull victim to shore (slowly, steadily)

**Communication:** "Flotation coming! Grab it! Hold on!"

**Common mistake:** Throwing directly at victim (they can't see clearly, might miss)

---

**Step 3: ROW (if boat available, victim far from shore)**

**Technique:**
1. Approach victim from downwind (boat drifts toward them)
2. Stop boat before reaching victim (motor/oars can injure)
3. Extend object (oar, pole) for victim to grab
4. Pull victim to side of boat
5. If conscious and calm: Help them board
6. If panicking: Keep them holding boat side, row/motor to shore (don't bring them aboard - can capsize)

**Communication:** "Grab the boat! Hold on! We're going to shore!"

---

**Step 4: GO (LAST RESORT - trained rescuers only)**

**If you must enter water:**

**Before entering:**
- Bring flotation device (kickboard, life ring, boogie board)
- Remove heavy clothing, shoes
- Tell someone your plan (have backup rescuer)
- Assess hazards (currents, cold, distance)

**Approach technique:**
- Swim to victim from behind (prevents panicked grab)
- Stay arm's length away
- Push flotation to victim: "Grab this! Hold on!"
- Do NOT let victim grab you (you'll both drown)

**If victim grabs you:**
1. Take deep breath
2. Dive underwater (victim will let go to return to surface)
3. Resurface behind victim, try again

**Towing to safety:**
- Victim holds flotation, you tow flotation (not victim)
- Kick from behind, pushing flotation ahead
- Talk calmly: "Keep holding on. We're almost there."

**Child-specific considerations:**
- Smaller children: Can sometimes reach and grab in one motion
- Panicking child: More unpredictable than adult
- If child goes under: Dive immediately (don't wait)

---

## Drowning Rescue and Resuscitation

### Immediate Actions Upon Rescue

**Priority: Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC)**

**Step 1: Remove from water**
- Face-up
- Horizontal position (don't hold vertically)
- Support head and neck

**Step 2: Check responsiveness**
- Tap shoulders, shout name
- Responsive? Place in recovery position, keep warm, call 911

**Step 3: Check breathing**
- Look, listen, feel (10 seconds max)
- Breathing normally? Recovery position, monitor, call 911
- Not breathing? Begin resuscitation immediately

**Step 4: Give 5 rescue breaths FIRST** (different from standard CPR)
- Drowning = respiratory arrest (need oxygen immediately)
- Tilt head, lift chin, pinch nose (or cover mouth+nose for infant)
- 5 breaths, 1 second each, watch for chest rise
- Even if no chest rise, continue (water may be blocking)

**Step 5: Begin CPR**
- Standard pediatric CPR ratio (see Pediatric CPR entry)
- Infant: 30:2 (single rescuer) or 15:2 (two rescuers)
- Child: 30:2 (single rescuer) or 15:2 (two rescuers)
- Continue until EMS arrives or child revives

**Step 6: Call 911**
- If alone: 2 minutes CPR first, then call (need to deliver oxygen)
- If others present: Someone calls immediately while you perform CPR

**Do NOT:**
- ❌ Attempt to drain water from lungs (Heimlich maneuver for drowning is outdated and harmful)
- ❌ Spend time removing water (priority is rescue breaths → CPR)
- ❌ Give up quickly (survival possible after 30+ minutes in cold water)

### Water in Lungs - Common Misconceptions

**Myth:** Must remove all water from lungs before CPR.  
**Reality:** Small amount of water doesn't prevent oxygen exchange. Rescue breaths push past it.

**Myth:** Heimlich maneuver for drowning victims.  
**Reality:** Wastes time, delays rescue breaths, can cause vomiting (aspiration risk).

**When water may come out:**
- During rescue breaths (normal - continue breathing)
- During compressions (water pushed from stomach)
- Turn head to side briefly, clear mouth, continue

**Post-resuscitation:** ALL drowning victims need hospital evaluation (delayed drowning complications possible)

---

## Secondary Drowning / Delayed Complications

**Secondary drowning:** Water in lungs causes delayed breathing problems (4-24 hours later)

**Dry drowning:** Laryngospasm (throat closes) causes respiratory distress without water in lungs

**Combined term (medically accurate):** Post-immersion respiratory distress

### Warning Signs (0-48 Hours After Water Incident)

**Seek immediate medical care if:**
- Persistent coughing
- Difficulty breathing, wheezing
- Chest pain
- Extreme fatigue, lethargy (more than expected after ordeal)
- Confusion, irritability
- Vomiting
- Bluish lips or skin
- Fast breathing (beyond initial rescue period)

**Even if child seemed fine after rescue:** Monitor for 24 hours. Any of above symptoms = emergency.

**Who is at risk:**
- Any submersion incident (even brief)
- Coughing/choking on water (even in shallow water)
- Near-drowning rescue
- Child who was "fine" but inhaled water

**Not at risk:**
- Splashing, getting water in face
- Brief underwater swimming (normal swimming)
- Playing in water without submersion incident

---

## Cold Water Drowning - Special Considerations

**Hypothermia protective effect:** Cold water (<70°F / 21°C) slows metabolism, preserves brain.

**Children survive longer in cold water** (smaller body size = faster cooling = more protection)

### Documented survivals:
- 2-year-old: 66 minutes underwater, full recovery
- 5-year-old: 45 minutes underwater, minimal brain damage
- Multiple cases: 30+ minutes, full neurological recovery

**Why:** Mammalian diving reflex + hypothermia slows brain oxygen consumption by 50-75%

### Cold Water Rescue Protocol

**During rescue:**
- Continue CPR longer than warm-water drowning (minimum 30 minutes)
- Gentle handling (rough movement can trigger cardiac arrest in hypothermic victim)

**Post-rescue:**
- Remove wet clothing
- Wrap in dry blankets
- Skin-to-skin contact (adult's body heat)
- Warm gradually (no hot water - causes shock)
- Core rewarming priority (insulate head, torso, neck, groin)

**Do NOT stop CPR** until victim is warm (>86°F / 30°C core temp) and still unresponsive.

**Medical saying:** "Not dead until warm and dead" (aggressive rewarming + CPR in hospital)

---

## Water Safety Rules by Age

### Toddlers (1-3 Years)

**Rules to teach (simple language):**
1. "Always hold a grown-up's hand near water."
2. "Don't go near water without asking."
3. "Life jacket on before playing near water."

**Enforcement:** Physical barriers + supervision (they cannot internalize rules yet)

---

### Young Children (4-9 Years)

**Rules to teach:**
1. "Never swim alone. Always have a buddy."
2. "Ask an adult before going near water."
3. "Life jacket on in boats and deep water."
4. "If you see someone drowning, tell an adult. Don't jump in."
5. "No running or pushing near water."
6. "No holding someone underwater (even playing)."

**Enforcement:** Clear consequences + supervision (they can follow rules but need reminders)

---

### Older Children & Teens (10+ Years)

**Rules to teach:**
1. "Never swim alone. Buddy system always."
2. "No alcohol or drugs near water."
3. "Check water depth before diving (9 feet minimum, clear of obstacles)."
4. "Never swim in flood water (currents, hidden hazards, contamination)."
5. "If caught in current: Swim parallel to shore, then angle back."
6. "Rescue technique: Reach or throw, don't go (unless trained)."
7. "If you can't swim in a life jacket, you can't swim without one." (respect your limits)

**Enforcement:** Natural consequences discussion + graduated independence

---

## Improvised Flotation Devices (Disaster Situations)

**If commercial PFDs unavailable:**

### Makeshift Flotation

**Plastic bottles (2-liter soda bottles):**
- 4-6 empty bottles with caps tight
- Place in backpack or duffel bag
- Wear on front of body
- Provides ~15-20 lbs buoyancy (keeps head above water for small child)

**Plastic bags:**
- Large trash bags (30-gallon+)
- Fill with air, tie tightly
- Hug to chest while swimming
- Temporary only (bags puncture easily)

**Coolers, plastic containers:**
- Empty, sealed tight
- Hold onto while in water
- Can support child's weight while kicking

**Clothing:**
- Pants tied at ankles, swung overhead to fill with air, tie waist closed
- Provides temporary flotation (10-15 minutes before air escapes)

**Logs, planks:**
- Natural wood floats
- Straddle or drape body across
- Flotation only, not safety (no head support)

**CRITICAL:** These are emergency measures only. Not safe for unsupervised use. Not a substitute for proper PFD.

---

## Post-Disaster Water Hazards

### Flood Water

**DO NOT allow children to play in flood water:**
- Sewage contamination (disease risk)
- Chemical contamination (fuel, pesticides, industrial waste)
- Fast-moving (stronger than it appears - can sweep away adult)
- Hidden hazards (debris, glass, nails, sharp objects)
- Unstable footing (holes, drop-offs)
- Electrocution risk (downed power lines)
- Wildlife (snakes, alligators displaced)

**If crossing flood water unavoidable:**
- Adult carries child (keep child's head above water)
- Life jacket on child
- Rope between adults (human chain)
- Probe ahead with stick (check depth, stability)

**Turn around, don't drown:** 6 inches of moving water can knock adult down. 12 inches can carry car away.

---

### Standing Water (Puddles, Containers)

**Mosquito breeding:** Standing water for 4+ days = mosquito larvae (disease vectors)

**Management:**
- Dump any container holding water (buckets, tires, tarps)
- Cover necessary water storage (screens to prevent access)
- Treat standing water (mosquito dunks) if cannot eliminate

**Drowning risk:** Even shallow standing water is risk for infants/toddlers (face-down, cannot lift head)

---

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| "He knows how to swim, he doesn't need supervision" | Even Olympic swimmers drown - always supervise |
| "The life jacket is somewhere in the boat" | Life jacket ON before boarding |
| "Just for a second..." (leaving child in bath/pool) | Never leave, not even for a second |
| Jumping in to rescue without flotation | Reach, throw, row - don't go without flotation |
| Assuming splashing/noise means drowning | Drowning is silent - watch for vertical body position |
| CPR before rescue breaths in drowning | 5 rescue breaths FIRST (respiratory arrest, needs oxygen) |
| Buying life jacket child will "grow into" | Must fit NOW (too big = slips off) |
| Teaching child to swim = safe without supervision | Swimming skills don't eliminate drowning risk |
| Assuming child can't drown in shallow water | 50% of child drownings in <6 inches of water |
| Relying on swimming aids (floaties, water wings) | NOT Coast Guard approved - provide false security |

---

## Emergency Water Safety Kit

**Essential items:**
- [ ] Life jackets for all children (properly sized, inspected)
- [ ] Throwable flotation device (Type IV)
- [ ] 50-foot rope (for throw rescue)
- [ ] Life hook / shepherd's crook (for reach rescue)
- [ ] First aid kit (see medical entries)
- [ ] Emergency whistle (signal for help)
- [ ] Waterproof flashlight (night rescue)
- [ ] Emergency contact numbers (laminated card)

**For boats:**
- [ ] All above items plus:
- [ ] Visual distress signals (flares, flag)
- [ ] Paddle/oar (if motor fails)
- [ ] Bailer (remove water)
- [ ] Anchor
- [ ] Extra life jackets (Type I for offshore)

---

## Swimming Lessons - When and What Type

**AAP recommendations:**
- Age 1-4: Swimming lessons reduce drowning risk by 88%
- Start: Between ages 1-4, depending on child's readiness
- NOT a substitute for supervision

**Readiness signs:**
- Child shows interest in water
- Can follow simple directions
- Has basic motor skills (walking, jumping)

**What to look for in lessons:**
- Water acclimation (comfort in water)
- Floating on back (survival skill)
- Rolling to back to breathe
- Treading water
- Exit from water (climbing out)

**NOT priorities:**
- Perfect stroke form (survival > style)
- Distance swimming (endurance comes later)
- Diving

**Post-disaster considerations:**
- Swimming lessons may not be available
- Focus on basic water comfort and floating if teaching at home
- Practice only in safe, controlled environment with supervision
