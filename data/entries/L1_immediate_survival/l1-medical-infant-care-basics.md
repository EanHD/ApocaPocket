# Infant Care Basics - Post-Disaster Survival

## Overview

**Infants (0-12 months) are the most vulnerable population in survival situations.** They cannot regulate body temperature, communicate needs, or defend themselves. Infection, dehydration, and hypothermia can be fatal within hours.

**This entry covers:** Essential care for infants when medical facilities are unavailable or overwhelmed. Focuses on preventing the most common causes of infant mortality in disasters.

**Critical needs:** Warmth (36.5-37.5°C / 97.7-99.5°F), feeding every 2-3 hours, clean environment, and constant supervision.

---

## Age Categories & Development

| Age Range | Term | Weight Range | Key Vulnerabilities |
|-----------|------|--------------|---------------------|
| 0-7 days | Newborn | 5.5-10 lbs (2.5-4.5 kg) | Umbilical infection, hypothermia, feeding failure |
| 1-4 weeks | Neonatal | 6-11 lbs (2.7-5 kg) | Jaundice, dehydration, SIDS risk |
| 1-3 months | Young infant | 8-14 lbs (3.6-6.4 kg) | Infections, reflux, developmental delays |
| 3-6 months | Infant | 12-18 lbs (5.4-8.2 kg) | Choking (starting solids), rolling injuries |
| 6-12 months | Older infant | 16-24 lbs (7.3-10.9 kg) | Crawling injuries, toxic ingestions |

**Premature infants:** Require specialized care beyond this entry's scope - prioritize medical evacuation.

---

## Umbilical Cord Care (0-14 Days)

### Normal Healing Timeline
- **Days 0-3:** Cord is white/gray, soft, moist (attached to belly)
- **Days 3-7:** Cord dries, turns brown/black, hardens
- **Days 7-14:** Cord falls off naturally (average day 10)
- **Days 14-21:** Belly button fully heals

### Daily Care Protocol

**Dry cord care method (AAP recommended):**

1. **Keep cord dry and exposed**
   - Fold diaper below cord (prevent urine contact)
   - No covering with clothing if possible
   - Air exposure accelerates drying

2. **Clean 2-3 times per day:**
   - Plain water ONLY (no alcohol, no antibiotics unless infection present)
   - Use clean cloth or gauze
   - Gently clean base where cord meets skin
   - Pat completely dry

3. **Do NOT:**
   - Pull on cord (let it fall off naturally)
   - Cover with bandages
   - Submerge in bath water (sponge baths only until cord falls off)
   - Apply powders, lotions, or oils

### Infection Warning Signs ⚠️

**Seek immediate medical care if:**
- **Redness extending >1 cm from cord base** (cellulitis)
- Yellow or green discharge / pus
- Foul smell (rotten/fishy)
- Bleeding >few drops
- Fever >100.4°F (38°C)
- Baby is lethargic or refusing to eat

**Omphalitis (cord infection) is life-threatening** - can cause sepsis within 24 hours in newborns.

### Emergency Treatment (if medical care unavailable)

**If redness/pus present:**
1. Clean with sterile water 4x daily
2. Apply **topical antibiotic** (triple antibiotic ointment) to base
3. Keep completely dry between cleanings
4. Monitor for spreading redness (mark edge with pen, check hourly)
5. If spreading or fever develops: **oral antibiotics needed** (amoxicillin 20-30 mg/kg/day divided 3x daily)

**DO NOT DELAY seeking medical care** - newborn infections progress rapidly.

## Breastfeeding Support

### Why Breastfeeding is Critical in Disasters

- **No contaminated water risk** (formula requires clean water)
- **Free and always available**
- **Antibodies protect from infections** (mother passes immunity to baby)
- **Correct temperature automatically**
- **Reduces infant mortality by 50-80%** in resource-limited settings (WHO data)

### Feeding Schedule by Age

| Age | Frequency | Duration Each Side | Total per 24h |
|-----|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| 0-3 days | Every 2-3 hours | 10-15 minutes | 8-12 feedings |
| 3-7 days | Every 2-3 hours | 15-20 minutes | 8-12 feedings |
| 1-4 weeks | Every 2-4 hours | 15-30 minutes | 8-10 feedings |
| 1-3 months | Every 2.5-4 hours | 20-40 minutes | 6-8 feedings |
| 3-6 months | Every 3-4 hours | 20-40 minutes | 5-7 feedings |
| 6-12 months | Every 4-6 hours + solids | 15-30 minutes | 4-6 feedings |

**Never go >4 hours without feeding** (newborns) or >6 hours (older infants) - dehydration risk.

### Proper Latch Technique

**Signs of good latch:**
- ✓ Baby's mouth covers most of areola (not just nipple)
- ✓ Lips flanged outward (like fish lips)
- ✓ Chin touching breast, nose free
- ✓ Rhythmic sucking pattern (suck-swallow-breathe)
- ✓ Minimal discomfort (no sharp pain)

**Poor latch signs:**
- ❌ Nipple pain, cracking, bleeding
- ❌ Clicking sounds while feeding
- ❌ Baby fussy after feeding (still hungry)
- ❌ Cheeks dimpling inward while sucking

**To improve latch:**
1. Support breast with hand (C-hold: thumb on top, 4 fingers underneath)
2. Tickle baby's upper lip with nipple (triggers rooting reflex)
3. Wait for wide open mouth (like yawn)
4. Quickly bring baby to breast (bring baby to you, not breast to baby)
5. Aim nipple toward roof of mouth

### Increasing Milk Supply (if insufficient)

**Signs of low supply:**
- Fewer than 6 wet diapers per day (after day 5)
- Weight loss >10% from birth weight
- Dark yellow/orange urine (concentrated = dehydrated)
- Baby constantly fussy, not satisfied after feeding

**How to increase production:**
1. **Feed more frequently:** Every 1.5-2 hours (supply = demand)
2. **Both breasts each feeding:** 10-15 min each side, alternate starting side
3. **Pump after feedings:** 10-15 min (stimulates more production)
4. **Stay hydrated:** Mother drinks 3-4 liters water daily
5. **Rest:** Sleep when baby sleeps (stress reduces supply)
6. **Skin-to-skin contact:** 2+ hours daily (stimulates hormones)

**Foods that may help (traditional/anecdotal):**
- Oatmeal (whole oats)
- Barley
- Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
- Nuts (almonds, cashews)
- Fennel, fenugreek (herbs)

**Avoid:** Alcohol, excessive caffeine (>300mg/day), peppermint/sage (can reduce supply)

### Maternal Nutrition During Breastfeeding

**Calorie needs:** Mother requires **+500 calories per day** above normal (total ~2200-2500 cal/day)

**Critical nutrients:**
- **Protein:** 70-100g daily (meat, eggs, beans, nuts)
- **Calcium:** 1000mg daily (if no dairy: leafy greens, fortified foods)
- **Iron:** 9-10mg daily (red meat, fortified cereals)
- **Fluids:** 3-4 liters (12-16 cups) water daily

**If mother is malnourished:** Breastfeeding still provides better nutrition than formula in disaster conditions (breast milk quality maintained even with poor maternal diet - mother's body prioritizes baby)

---

## Formula Preparation (When Breastfeeding Impossible)

### When to Use Formula

**ONLY if:**
- Mother is deceased or incapacitated
- Mother has HIV/AIDS (transmission risk via breast milk)
- Baby cannot latch due to medical issues
- Adopted/orphaned infant

**WHO Guidelines:** Breastfeeding preferred even in disasters unless above conditions met.

### Safe Formula Preparation (No Electricity)

**Equipment needed:**
- Powdered infant formula (NOT cow's milk, NOT condensed milk)
- Clean bottles (glass or BPA-free plastic)
- Boiled and cooled water
- Measuring scoops (included in formula)
- Heat source

**Step-by-step protocol:**

1. **Boil water:** 
   - Rolling boil for 1 minute (sea level) or 3 minutes (high altitude >2000m)
   - Let cool to 70°C / 158°F (hot to touch but not boiling - wait ~5 min)
   - **Why 70°C:** Kills bacteria in powdered formula (formula is NOT sterile)

2. **Clean hands:**
   - Wash with soap and water for 20 seconds
   - Or use hand sanitizer if water unavailable

3. **Measure water FIRST:**
   - Use bottle markings (add water before powder)
   - **Exact measurements critical:** Too concentrated = dehydration, too dilute = malnutrition

4. **Add formula powder:**
   - Use ONLY scoop from that formula container
   - Level scoop (not heaping, not packed)
   - Standard ratio: 1 scoop per 2 oz (60 mL) water

5. **Mix thoroughly:**
   - Cap bottle, shake vigorously for 30 seconds
   - Check for lumps

6. **Cool to body temperature:**
   - Test on inside of wrist (should feel barely warm)
   - **Never microwave** (creates hot spots that can burn)
   - Cool quickly: Place bottle in cold water bath

### Feeding Amount by Age

| Age | Amount per Feeding | Frequency | Total per 24h |
|-----|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| 0-1 week | 1-2 oz (30-60 mL) | Every 2-3 hours | 8-12 feedings |
| 1-4 weeks | 2-4 oz (60-120 mL) | Every 3-4 hours | 6-8 feedings |
| 1-2 months | 4-5 oz (120-150 mL) | Every 3-4 hours | 6-7 feedings |
| 2-4 months | 5-6 oz (150-180 mL) | Every 3-4 hours | 5-6 feedings |
| 4-6 months | 6-7 oz (180-210 mL) | Every 4-5 hours | 4-6 feedings |
| 6-12 months | 7-8 oz (210-240 mL) + solids | Every 4-6 hours | 3-5 feedings |

**Rule of thumb:** Baby needs ~2.5 oz (75 mL) per pound of body weight per day
- 10 lb baby = 25 oz (750 mL) per day
- Divide by number of feedings

### Formula Storage (No Refrigeration)

| Condition | Safe Duration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Mixed formula (room temp 68-77°F) | 1 hour maximum |
| Mixed formula (cooler with ice) | 24 hours |
| Dry powder (unopened) | Until expiration date |
| Dry powder (opened can) | 1 month (keep dry, covered) |

**In hot weather (>85°F / 30°C):** Mix immediately before feeding, discard any leftovers after 1 hour

**NEVER:** Save partially consumed bottle (bacteria from baby's mouth multiplies rapidly)

### Emergency Formula Alternatives (SHORT-TERM ONLY)

**If infant formula unavailable (use for <48 hours only):**

**Evaporated milk formula (for babies >6 months):**
- 13 oz can evaporated milk
- 19 oz boiled water
- 2 tablespoons sugar or corn syrup

**Mix thoroughly, feed same amounts as regular formula. Seek regular formula as soon as possible.**

**DO NOT USE (dangerous):**
- ❌ Regular cow's milk (not digestible for infants <12 months)
- ❌ Condensed milk (too much sugar)
- ❌ Soy milk, almond milk, other plant milks (insufficient nutrition)
- ❌ Diluted adult food

### Bottle Cleaning Without Running Water

**Method 1: Boiling**
1. Rinse bottle with clean water immediately after feeding
2. Wash with soap and water (use bottle brush for inside)
3. Boil in pot for 5 minutes
4. Air dry on clean cloth (do not towel dry - recontaminates)

**Method 2: Bleach disinfection** (if boiling not possible)
1. Wash with soap and water
2. Mix 1 teaspoon (5 mL) bleach per 1 gallon (4 L) water
3. Soak bottles for 2 minutes
4. Air dry (do not rinse - residual bleach evaporates)

## Diaper Care & Rash Prevention

### Diapering Frequency
- **Newborns (0-1 month):** Change every 2-3 hours or after each feeding
- **Older infants (1-12 months):** Change every 3-4 hours or when soiled
- **Night:** Check and change at least once during night

**Wet diaper count (hydration indicator):**
- Day 1: 1 wet diaper
- Day 2: 2 wet diapers
- Day 3: 3 wet diapers
- Days 4+: 6-8 wet diapers per 24 hours

**Fewer than 6 wet diapers = dehydration** - increase feedings immediately.

### Diaper Changing Protocol

1. **Gather supplies first:**
   - Clean diaper
   - Wipes or clean wet cloth
   - Barrier cream (if available)
   - Change mat or clean towel

2. **Remove soiled diaper:**
   - Lay baby on back on safe surface
   - Open diaper, use front to wipe bulk of stool
   - Fold soiled diaper under baby (clean side up)

3. **Clean thoroughly:**
   - Wipe front to back (especially girls - prevents UTI)
   - Lift legs gently (hold ankles together)
   - Clean all skin folds
   - Pat dry completely

4. **Apply barrier cream** (if available):
   - Zinc oxide cream (Desitin, Balmex)
   - Petroleum jelly (Vaseline)
   - Thin layer (visible but not thick)

5. **Put on clean diaper:**
   - Front tabs should reach belly button level
   - Should fit snugly but not tight (2 fingers fit under waistband)

### Diaper Rash - Prevention & Treatment

**Severity levels:**

| Severity | Appearance | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Mild** | Pink/red skin, no texture change | Change frequently, barrier cream, air dry |
| **Moderate** | Bright red, slight swelling, defined borders | Change every 2h, thick barrier cream, naked time 3x daily (15 min) |
| **Severe** | Deep red, raised bumps, open sores, bleeding | All above + antifungal cream, possible infection |
| **Infected (yeast)** | Bright red with satellite spots, not responding to barrier cream | Antifungal cream (clotrimazole 2x daily), keep very dry |

**Treatment protocol for moderate-severe rash:**

1. **Increase air exposure:**
   - 15-30 minutes naked time, 3-4 times per day
   - Lay baby on waterproof pad (will urinate/defecate)
   - Warm room (prevent hypothermia)

2. **Change immediately when soiled:**
   - Don't wait even 10 minutes
   - Check every 1-2 hours

3. **Clean gently:**
   - Plain water on soft cloth (no wipes - irritating)
   - Pat dry, do not rub
   - Can use hairdryer on cool setting (12+ inches away)

4. **Barrier cream - thick layer:**
   - "Frosting thickness" - visible white layer
   - Zinc oxide most effective
   - Apply at every diaper change

5. **Avoid:**
   - ❌ Plastic pants over diaper (traps moisture)
   - ❌ Tight diapers
   - ❌ Scented wipes
   - ❌ Talcum powder (inhalation risk)

**When to seek medical care:**
- Rash not improving after 3 days of treatment
- Fever (>100.4°F / 38°C)
- Open sores, bleeding, or blisters
- Rash spreading beyond diaper area
- Baby refusing to eat or lethargic

### Improvised Diapers (if disposables unavailable)

**Cloth diaper method:**
1. Cut absorbent fabric into 24" x 24" (60 x 60 cm) square
   - Best: Cotton T-shirts, flannel, towels
   - Layer 2-3 squares for absorbency
2. Fold into triangle or rectangle
3. Secure with safety pins (4 pins, one at each corner)
4. Cover with waterproof layer (plastic bag, trash bag)

**Cleaning cloth diapers:**
1. Dump solid waste (bury far from water source)
2. Rinse in cold water immediately
3. Wash with soap in hot water
4. Boil for 5 minutes (disinfection)
5. Dry in sun (UV kills bacteria)

**Minimum supply:** 20-24 cloth diapers per baby (allows for washing cycle)

## Common Infant Emergencies

### Choking

**Prevention (by age):**
- **0-6 months:** No solids, ensure bottle nipple flow not too fast (milk should drip slowly when inverted)
- **6-12 months:** No round foods (grapes, hot dogs), no nuts, no hard candies, cut foods into <1/4 inch pieces

**If choking (cannot cry/cough):**
1. Call for help
2. Position infant face-down on forearm (head lower than chest)
3. 5 back blows between shoulder blades (heel of hand)
4. Turn over, 5 chest thrusts (2 fingers on center of chest)
5. Repeat until object dislodged or baby unconscious
6. If unconscious: Begin infant CPR (see related entry)

### Fever (Temperature >100.4°F / 38°C)

**ANY fever in infant <3 months is medical emergency** - risk of serious bacterial infection.

**Temperature taking methods:**
- **Rectal (most accurate for infants):** 
  - Lubricate thermometer with petroleum jelly
  - Insert 1/2 inch (1.3 cm)
  - Hold in place 2 minutes
  - Add 0°F (same reading)
- **Axillary (armpit):** Add 1°F (0.6°C) to reading
- **Forehead (temporal):** Less accurate but non-invasive

**Fever management:**
- Acetaminophen (infants >3 months, see dosing entry)
- Ibuprofen (infants >6 months)
- Lukewarm bath (85-90°F / 29-32°C water)
- Light clothing
- Increase feeding frequency (prevent dehydration)

**NEVER:** Cold bath (causes shivering, raises core temp), alcohol rub (toxic if absorbed), aspirin (Reye's syndrome risk)

### Dehydration

**Signs by severity:**

**Mild (5% weight loss):**
- Slightly dry mouth
- Normal activity
- 4-6 wet diapers per day

**Moderate (5-10% weight loss):**
- Very dry mouth, sticky saliva
- Sunken soft spot (fontanelle)
- Decreased activity
- 2-4 wet diapers per day

**Severe (>10% weight loss) - EMERGENCY:**
- No tears when crying
- Sunken eyes
- No wet diaper in 8+ hours
- Lethargic, won't wake easily
- Skin stays tented when pinched

**Treatment:**
- Mild: Increase feeding frequency (every 1.5-2 hours)
- Moderate: Oral rehydration solution (Pedialyte) between feedings
- Severe: **Medical evacuation required** - IV fluids needed

---

## Infant Sleep Safety (SIDS Prevention)

**SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome):** Unexplained death of baby <1 year, usually during sleep. Peak risk 2-4 months.

**Safe sleep rules (reduce SIDS risk by 70%):**

1. **Back to sleep:** Always place on back (not side, not stomach)
2. **Firm surface:** Crib mattress or firm pad (no soft surfaces)
3. **Nothing in sleep space:** 
   - No pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, bumper pads
   - Only baby and fitted sheet
4. **Room sharing:** Baby in same room as adult (not same bed) for first 6-12 months
5. **Temperature:** Room 68-72°F (20-22°C), dress in light sleeper (no blankets)
6. **Smoke-free environment**
7. **Pacifier for sleep** (if baby accepts it)

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Sleep with baby in adult bed (suffocation risk)
- ❌ Sleep with baby on couch/chair (highest SIDS risk)
- ❌ Place baby on soft surfaces (waterbeds, sheepskins, cushions)
- ❌ Overheat (overdressing, too many blankets)

**In disaster situation (no crib):**
- Use sturdy cardboard box lined with thin blanket as makeshift bassinet
- Ensure baby cannot roll out or get stuck
- Place on floor (safer than elevated surfaces)

---

## When to Seek Immediate Medical Care

**Life-threatening emergencies (call 911 or evacuate immediately):**
- Difficulty breathing (flaring nostrils, retractions, grunting)
- Bluish lips or skin
- Unresponsive or won't wake
- Seizure
- Fever >100.4°F (38°C) in infant <3 months
- Fever >104°F (40°C) any infant
- Severe dehydration (no wet diaper 8+ hours)
- Bloody or black stool (not meconium)
- Projectile vomiting
- Bulging soft spot when upright
- Stiff neck
- Any significant injury

---

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Pulling umbilical cord to remove it | Let cord fall off naturally (7-14 days) |
| Using alcohol on cord | Plain water only (alcohol delays healing) |
| Bathing baby before cord falls off | Sponge baths only until cord detaches |
| Overfeeding ("more is better") | Follow age-appropriate amounts (see tables) |
| Saving formula leftovers | Discard after 1 hour (bacteria growth) |
| Using regular cow's milk <12 months | Breast milk or infant formula only |
| Changing diapers every 6+ hours | Every 2-4 hours (rash prevention) |
| Sleeping with baby in bed | Room-sharing (different sleep surfaces) |
| Overdressing baby | Dress in one more layer than adult wears |
