summary: Cooking food increases caloric availability by 30-50%, kills pathogens, and improves digestibility. These methods work without pots, pans, or utensils — using only fire, rocks, sticks, leaves,
  and clay found in nature.
warnings:
- NEVER use rocks from riverbeds or wet environments for hot-rock cooking — trapped moisture causes rocks to EXPLODE violently when heated. Use dry rocks from high ground.
- 'Avoid limestone, sandstone, and any layered/flaky rocks — they fracture easily when heated. Best: granite, basalt, dense dark stones.'
- All wild meat must reach 74°C (165°F) internal temperature to kill parasites. Cut into smaller pieces for more even cooking.
- Toxic plants remain toxic after cooking in most cases — cooking does NOT make unidentified plants safe
steps:
- 'SPIT ROASTING: simplest method. Sharpen a green (living) hardwood stick. Skewer meat and prop over coals (not flames — flames char the outside while the inside stays raw). Rotate frequently. A Y-stick
  fork on each side supports the spit. Use for fish, small game, and root vegetables.'
- 'EMBER/ASH ROASTING: wrap food in large green leaves (burdock, maple, banana leaf) or a thick layer of wet clay. Bury directly in hot coals and ash. Tubers: 30-45 minutes. Small fish: 15-20 minutes. The
  leaf/clay layer steams the food and prevents burning. Clay-baked fish — crack off the clay and the skin/scales come with it.'
- 'HOT ROCK BOILING (no pot needed): dig a small pit and line with a hide, bark container, or tightly woven basket sealed with pitch. Fill with water. Heat rocks in fire until very hot (20-30 minutes, they
  should be too hot to approach closely). Using two green sticks as tongs, transfer rocks to the water. 3-5 fist-sized rocks will bring a gallon to a boil. Replace as rocks cool. Cook stews, soups, and
  porridge this way.'
- 'PLANKING: split a green hardwood log in half. Pin fish or meat to the flat face using small wooden pegs or skewers. Prop the plank near the fire (not in it) at a 60-70° angle, facing the fire. The radiant
  heat cooks the food slowly. Classic for salmon — takes 1-2 hours.'
- 'EARTH OVEN (underground oven): dig a pit 2ft × 2ft × 2ft. Build a fire in the pit and heat rocks for 1-2 hours. Remove coals, leave hot rocks. Layer: hot rocks → green leaves/grass → food → more green
  leaves → wet burlap/more leaves → 4-6 inches of dirt on top. Cooking time: 4-8 hours. Cooks large quantities (whole animal, multiple root vegetables). Hawaiian imu and New England clambake use this method.'
- 'BAMBOO COOKING (where available): cut a section of green bamboo at the node (so one end is sealed). Fill with water, rice, meat, vegetables. Plug open end with leaves. Prop at 45° angle over coals. The
  bamboo is both the pot and the serving vessel. One-time use per tube.'
- 'FLAT ROCK GRIDDLE: find a flat, dense rock 1-2 inches thick. Support over fire on smaller rocks. Let it heat for 15-20 minutes. Cook directly on the surface — thin meat slices, fish fillets, flat bread
  (flour + water patties). Grease with animal fat to prevent sticking.'
- 'DRYING/SMOKING RACK: build a 3-foot-high frame of green sticks over a low smoky fire. Slice meat/fish thin (¼ inch strips). Lay on the rack. Maintain low heat and thick smoke for 6-12 hours. This preserves
  meat for days to weeks. See smoking entry for details.'
