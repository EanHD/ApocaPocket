summary: Beginners die from exposure and panic. Experienced people die from complacency, overconfidence, and small mistakes that compound. This entry catalogs the most common preventable causes of death
  in long-term survival situations, learned from historical accounts and wilderness medicine data.
warnings:
- Complacency is lethal — 'I've done this 100 times' is when accidents happen
- Small infections kill slowly — a blister becomes cellulitis becomes sepsis over weeks
- Carbon monoxide has no smell and no warning — you just fall asleep and don't wake up
- Drowning is silent and fast — if you see someone in trouble, they're often already past the point of calling for help
steps:
- 'INFECTION FROM MINOR WOUNDS: Small cut, thorn puncture, blister. Ignored or poorly cleaned. Becomes infected (red, swollen, hot, pus). Spreads (red streaks = lymphangitis). Becomes sepsis. Death in 1-2
  weeks from the initial injury. PREVENTION: Clean ALL wounds immediately, even tiny ones. Check daily for infection signs. If red streaks appear, this is an emergency — heat, drainage, antibiotics if available.'
- 'CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING: Burning anything in an enclosed space produces CO. Symptoms: headache, nausea, confusion, sleepiness. You lie down to ''rest'' and die. Happens in snow shelters with fires,
  sealed cabins, tents with heaters. PREVENTION: ALWAYS ventilate. Crack a window, create airflow, use a chimney. If you have a headache in an enclosed space with fire, GET OUTSIDE immediately.'
- 'HYPOTHERMIA FROM GETTING WET: You know to stay dry, but you wade a stream, sweat inside your coat, or get caught in rain. ''I''ll warm up at camp'' — but you''re losing heat faster than you can produce
  it. Shivering stops (bad sign). Confusion sets in. You make poor decisions (paradoxical undressing — people strip naked in late-stage hypothermia). Death. PREVENTION: Change out of wet clothes IMMEDIATELY.
  Wring, hang, dry. If no dry clothes, get naked and use the wet clothes as insulation OUTSIDE a vapor barrier (trash bag, tarp) against your skin.'
- 'FALLS: Climbing rocks, crossing logs, working on shelter roofs. One slip. Head injury, broken bone, internal bleeding. Alone = likely death. With group = possibly survivable but incapacitating. PREVENTION:
  Three points of contact on any climb. Test handholds. Move slowly on wet/icy surfaces. If you think ''this looks dangerous,'' it is — find another way.'
- 'DROWNING IN CALM WATER: Crossing a stream that''s deeper/faster than expected. Cold water saps strength instantly. Heavy pack drags you down. You can''t call out. Death in 2-5 minutes. PREVENTION: Unbuckle
  pack straps when crossing water (can shed it if you fall). Use a pole for stability. Cross at wide, shallow spots (not narrow fast ones). Link arms if crossing as a group.'
- 'AXE/KNIFE INJURIES: Tired, rushing, careless. One bad stroke. Deep cut to leg, hand, or foot. Bleeding won''t stop (major artery or vein). No way to evacuate. Death from blood loss in minutes to hours.
  PREVENTION: Never cut toward yourself. Never use tools when exhausted. Keep tools sharp (dull tools slip). Wear boots when chopping (protect feet).'
- 'FOOD POISONING/DYSENTERY: Ate something questionable. Or drank untreated water ''just this once.'' Vomiting and diarrhea start 6-24 hours later. Dehydration. Weakness. Can''t gather water or food. Death
  from dehydration in 2-5 days. PREVENTION: When in doubt, throw it out. ALWAYS treat water. Cook meat thoroughly. If someone gets sick, priority #1 is hydration (ORS recipe in medical entries).'
- 'DEHYDRATION (SLOW): You''re drinking water, but not enough. You feel ''fine'' — slight headache, tired. Days pass. Cognitive decline. Bad decisions. Injuries from carelessness. Eventually collapse. PREVENTION:
  Urine should be pale yellow. If it''s dark or you''re not urinating every 4-6 hours, you''re dehydrated. Drink more. In hot climates, drink even when not thirsty.'
- 'OVERWORK LEADING TO COLLAPSE: Trying to do too much. Not resting. Not eating enough. Stress compounds. Immune system crashes. Illness (cold, flu, infection) takes hold. No energy to recover. Downward
  spiral. PREVENTION: Rest days are mandatory, not optional. Eat enough (hard when food is scarce, but you must maintain caloric intake). Sleep 8 hours. Your body is a tool — maintain it.'
- 'COMPLACENCY WITH FIRE: You''ve built 100 fires safely. This time you don''t fully extinguish before sleeping. Or you build too close to your shelter. Ember catches. Shelter burns. You''re trapped or
  lose all gear. PREVENTION: Fire is always dangerous. Never sleep with fire burning unless you have a contained hearth and someone on watch. Clear a 10-foot radius around fires. Keep water/dirt nearby
  for extinguishing.'
