# Pain Management Ladder - WHO Stepwise Approach to Analgesia

## Overview

Pain is one of the most common symptoms requiring treatment. Effective pain management:
- **Reduces suffering** (ethical imperative)
- **Promotes healing** (reduces stress hormones, improves sleep)
- **Enables function** (allows movement, breathing, coughing)
- **Prevents chronic pain** (undertreated acute pain → chronic pain syndrome)

The **WHO Analgesic Ladder** provides a systematic approach:
1. Start with simplest, safest medication for pain severity
2. Titrate upward within each step before moving to next
3. Combine medications (different mechanisms = additive effect)
4. Add adjuvant therapies (non-pharmacological methods, nerve pain medications)

**This entry covers:**
- Pain assessment
- WHO Three-Step Ladder (Mild → Moderate → Severe)
- Medication dosing by pain level
- Opioid safety and addiction prevention
- Non-pharmacological pain management
- Special populations (children, elderly, pregnancy)

## Pain Assessment

### Pain Scales

**Numeric Rating Scale (0-10):** Most common
- **0** = No pain
- **1-3** = Mild pain (annoying but doesn't interfere with activities)
- **4-6** = Moderate pain (interferes with concentration, limits some activities)
- **7-9** = Severe pain (can't think of anything else, limits most activities)
- **10** = Worst pain imaginable (often described as "want to die")

**FACES Pain Scale (for children, non-verbal):**
- 6 faces from smiling (0) to crying (10)
- Patient points to face matching their pain

**Verbal Descriptor Scale:**
- None → Mild → Moderate → Severe → Excruciating

### PQRST Assessment (Detailed Pain Evaluation)

**P - Provocation/Palliation:**
- What makes it worse? (movement, breathing, eating)
- What makes it better? (rest, position, ice/heat)

**Q - Quality:**
- Describe the pain: Sharp, dull, burning, throbbing, aching, shooting, stabbing?
- Different qualities suggest different causes (nerve pain = burning/shooting, muscle = aching, fracture = sharp)

**R - Region/Radiation:**
- Where is the pain? (point with one finger if possible)
- Does it spread anywhere? (radiates down arm, around chest, into back)

**S - Severity:**
- 0-10 scale (see above)

**T - Timing:**
- Constant or intermittent (comes and goes)?
- How long have you had it?
- Getting better, worse, or same?

### Red Flags (Pain Requiring Urgent Medical Evaluation)

**Seek immediate care if pain associated with:**
- Chest pain (possible heart attack, pulmonary embolism)
- Severe headache with stiff neck, fever, confusion (possible meningitis)
- Abdominal pain with fever, vomiting, rigid abdomen (possible appendicitis, perforation)
- Pain with weakness, numbness, loss of bowel/bladder control (possible spinal cord injury)
- Pain out of proportion to injury (possible compartment syndrome, necrotizing infection)
- Pain in testicle (testicular torsion - surgical emergency)

**These conditions require treating CAUSE, not just pain medication.**

## WHO Three-Step Analgesic Ladder

### Basic Principles

1. **"By the Ladder"** - Match pain intensity to appropriate step
2. **"By the Mouth"** - Oral route preferred (less invasive, longer duration)
3. **"By the Clock"** - Scheduled dosing (prevents pain, not just treats it)
4. **"For the Individual"** - Adjust to patient response (no single correct dose)
5. **"Attention to Detail"** - Monitor side effects, adjust as needed

### Starting Point

**Pain 1-3:** Step 1 (Non-opioid)
**Pain 4-6:** Step 2 (Weak opioid OR strong Step 1 + adjuvant)
**Pain 7-10:** Step 3 (Strong opioid)

---

## Step 1: Mild Pain (1-3/10) - Non-Opioid Analgesics

**Medications:**
1. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol)
2. NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Aspirin)

### Acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol)

**Mechanism:** Inhibits pain signaling in central nervous system, reduces fever

**Dosing:**
- **Adults:** 500-1000mg every 4-6 hours
  - Maximum: 3000-4000mg per day (3000mg if regular alcohol use, liver disease)
- **Children:** 10-15 mg/kg every 4-6 hours
  - Maximum: 75 mg/kg/day or 4000mg/day (whichever lower)

**Advantages:**
- Very safe in therapeutic doses
- No GI bleeding risk (unlike NSAIDs)
- No antiplatelet effect (safe with bleeding disorders)
- Safe in pregnancy (Category B)

**Disadvantages:**
- Less effective than NSAIDs for inflammatory pain (sprains, fractures, arthritis)
- Narrow margin between therapeutic and toxic dose
- Liver damage if overdose (>4000mg/day, especially with alcohol)

**Toxicity:**
- Acute overdose: Nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, confusion → liver failure (48-72 hours)
- Antidote: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) - most effective if given within 8 hours of overdose

**Contraindications:**
- Severe liver disease
- Active heavy alcohol use

### NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Aspirin)

**Mechanism:** Inhibits COX enzymes → reduces prostaglandins → decreases inflammation, pain, fever

#### **Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)**

**Dosing:**
- **Adults:** 400-800mg every 6-8 hours
  - Maximum: 3200mg/day
  - OTC maximum: 1200mg/day (higher doses prescription)
- **Children ≥6 months:** 10 mg/kg every 6-8 hours
  - Maximum: 40 mg/kg/day or 1200mg/day (whichever lower)

**Advantages:**
- Excellent for inflammatory pain (sprains, fractures, dental pain, menstrual cramps)
- Reduces fever
- Well-tolerated in short-term use

**Disadvantages:**
- GI upset, ulcers, bleeding (especially >7 days use)
- Kidney damage (especially if dehydrated)
- Increased bleeding risk (inhibits platelet function)
- Cardiovascular risk (high doses, long-term use)

#### **Naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)**

**Dosing:**
- **Adults:** 220-500mg every 8-12 hours
  - Maximum: 1500mg/day
- **Children ≥2 years:** 5-7 mg/kg every 8-12 hours
  - Maximum: 1000mg/day

**Advantages:**
- Longer duration (twice daily dosing vs ibuprofen 3-4x daily)
- Excellent for inflammatory conditions

**Disadvantages:**
- Same as ibuprofen (GI, kidney, bleeding risks)
- Possibly lower CV risk than ibuprofen (some studies)

#### **Aspirin**

**Dosing:**
- **Adults (pain/fever):** 325-650mg every 4-6 hours
  - Maximum: 4000mg/day
- **Adults (heart attack prevention):** 81-325mg once daily (low-dose)
- **Children:** Generally AVOID (<18 years - Reye's syndrome risk)
  - Exception: Kawasaki disease, juvenile arthritis (doctor-prescribed)

**Advantages:**
- Cheap, widely available
- Antiplatelet effect (heart attack/stroke prevention)

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher GI bleeding risk than ibuprofen
- Reye's syndrome in children with viral infections (liver failure, brain swelling)
- Permanent platelet inhibition (vs reversible with ibuprofen)

### NSAID Safety Guidelines

**Take with food or milk** (reduces GI irritation)

**Avoid if:**
- Active GI ulcer or bleeding
- Kidney disease
- Severe dehydration
- Bleeding disorder or on blood thinners (warfarin)
- Third trimester pregnancy (can cause premature closure of ductus arteriosus in fetus)
- Aspirin allergy (cross-reactivity with NSAIDs)

**Short-term use preferred:**
- <7-10 days for acute pain (fractures, sprains, dental)
- >10 days: Monitor for GI/kidney side effects

**Monitor for:**
- Black, tarry stools or blood in stool (GI bleeding)
- Decreased urine output (kidney damage)
- Swelling in legs (fluid retention, kidney issues)
- Chest pain (cardiovascular effects)

### Combination: Acetaminophen + NSAID

**Additive effect** (different mechanisms):
- Acetaminophen 1000mg + Ibuprofen 400mg = equivalent to 10mg morphine (some studies)
- Safe to combine (no interaction)
- Ideal for Step 1-2 pain

**Example schedule:**
- **8:00 AM:** Ibuprofen 400mg
- **12:00 PM:** Acetaminophen 1000mg
- **4:00 PM:** Ibuprofen 400mg
- **8:00 PM:** Acetaminophen 1000mg
- (Alternates every 4 hours, each drug every 8 hours)

---

## Step 2: Moderate Pain (4-6/10) - Weak Opioids or Combination

**Medications:**
1. Tramadol
2. Codeine + Acetaminophen (Tylenol #3)
3. Hydrocodone + Acetaminophen (Vicodin, Norco)
4. **OR Strong Step 1 (acetaminophen 1000mg + ibuprofen 800mg)**

### Tramadol (Ultram)

**Mechanism:** Weak opioid receptor agonist + increases serotonin/norepinephrine (dual mechanism)

**Dosing:**
- **Adults:** 50-100mg every 4-6 hours
  - Start 50mg (especially elderly, opioid-naive)
  - Maximum: 400mg/day
- **Children ≥12 years:** 50mg every 6 hours (lower doses than adults)
- **NOT recommended <12 years** (respiratory depression risk)

**Advantages:**
- Lower abuse/addiction potential than stronger opioids (but still exists)
- Effective for moderate pain
- Less constipation than traditional opioids
- Less respiratory depression than traditional opioids

**Disadvantages:**
- Seizure risk (especially >400mg/day or with other seizure-lowering drugs)
- Serotonin syndrome risk (if combined with SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs)
- Nausea, dizziness common
- Still has dependence/withdrawal risk (not "non-addictive" as sometimes claimed)

**Contraindications:**
- Seizure disorder
- On SSRI/SNRI antidepressants (increases serotonin syndrome risk - use caution)
- Severe liver or kidney disease

### Codeine + Acetaminophen (Tylenol #3, Tylenol #4)

**Dosing:**
- **Tylenol #3:** Codeine 30mg + Acetaminophen 300mg (1-2 tablets every 4 hours)
- **Tylenol #4:** Codeine 60mg + Acetaminophen 300mg (1 tablet every 4 hours)
- **Maximum:** 12 tablets/day (limited by acetaminophen - 3600mg)

**Advantages:**
- Combination product (two mechanisms)
- Effective for moderate pain

**Disadvantages:**
- Codeine is prodrug (converted to morphine by liver enzyme CYP2D6)
  - 10% of population are "poor metabolizers" (codeine ineffective)
  - 1-2% are "ultra-rapid metabolizers" (too much morphine = overdose risk, especially children)
- Constipation (very common)
- Nausea, drowsiness
- Addiction potential

**Black box warning (children):**
- Deaths reported in children post-tonsillectomy (ultra-rapid metabolizers)
- Generally avoid <12 years

### Hydrocodone + Acetaminophen (Vicodin, Norco)

**Dosing:**
- **Norco 5/325:** Hydrocodone 5mg + Acetaminophen 325mg (1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours)
- **Norco 10/325:** Hydrocodone 10mg + Acetaminophen 325mg (1 tablet every 4-6 hours)
- **Maximum:** Limit by acetaminophen (<4000mg/day)

**Advantages:**
- More potent than codeine (more consistent effect)
- Effective for moderate to moderately-severe pain

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher abuse/addiction potential than tramadol
- Constipation (very common)
- Respiratory depression risk (especially if combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines)
- Nausea, drowsiness

**Controlled substance:** Schedule II (high abuse potential, strict prescribing rules)

---

## Step 3: Severe Pain (7-10/10) - Strong Opioids

**Medications:**
1. Morphine
2. Oxycodone
3. Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
4. Fentanyl

**General principles:**
- Start low, go slow (especially opioid-naive patients)
- Titrate to effect (effective analgesia with tolerable side effects)
- Scheduled dosing (prevent pain) + PRN (as-needed) for breakthrough pain
- Aggressive management of side effects (constipation, nausea)

### Morphine (Gold Standard)

**Dosing:**

**Immediate-release (IR) oral:**
- **Adults:** 5-30mg every 4 hours
  - Opioid-naive start: 5-15mg
  - Opioid-tolerant: 15-30mg or higher
- **Children:** 0.15-0.3 mg/kg every 4 hours

**Extended-release (ER/SR):**
- For chronic pain only (NOT for acute pain)
- Dosed every 8-12 hours

**Injectable (IV/IM/SC):**
- **Adults:** 2-10mg IV every 2-4 hours (start 2-5mg)
- **Children:** 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV every 2-4 hours
- IV has 3x potency of oral (10mg PO ≈ 3-4mg IV)

**Advantages:**
- Well-studied, predictable
- Multiple formulations (oral, IV, IM, rectal)
- Inexpensive

**Disadvantages:**
- Histamine release (itching, flushing, hypotension) - give slowly IV
- Accumulates in kidney disease (metabolites cause toxicity)
- Constipation (very common)
- Respiratory depression

### Oxycodone

**Dosing:**

**Immediate-release:**
- **Adults:** 5-30mg every 4-6 hours
  - Opioid-naive start: 5-10mg
  - Opioid-tolerant: 15-30mg
- **Children ≥6 years:** 0.1-0.2 mg/kg every 4-6 hours (rarely used in children)

**Extended-release (OxyContin):**
- 10-80mg every 12 hours (chronic pain only)

**Combination products:**
- Percocet: Oxycodone 5mg + Acetaminophen 325mg
- Dose: 1-2 tablets every 6 hours (limited by acetaminophen)

**Advantages:**
- 1.5x more potent than morphine (oral)
- Less nausea than morphine (some patients)
- Oral bioavailability better than morphine (less first-pass metabolism)

**Disadvantages:**
- High abuse potential (OxyContin reformulated to deter crushing/snorting)
- Expensive compared to morphine
- Same side effects (constipation, respiratory depression)

### Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)

**Dosing:**

**Oral:**
- **Adults:** 2-4mg every 4-6 hours
  - Very potent (5-7x more potent than morphine)
  - Start low (2mg)

**Injectable (IV/IM/SC):**
- **Adults:** 0.5-2mg IV every 2-4 hours
  - 1mg IV hydromorphone ≈ 7mg IV morphine

**Advantages:**
- Very potent (good for opioid-tolerant patients, small volumes needed)
- Less nausea than morphine (some patients)

**Disadvantages:**
- High potency = easy to overdose (narrow therapeutic window)
- Expensive
- Same side effects as other opioids

### Fentanyl

**Dosing:**

**Injectable (IV/IM):**
- **Adults:** 25-100mcg IV every 1-2 hours
  - 100mcg fentanyl ≈ 10mg morphine (IV)
  - Start 25-50mcg (rapid onset, short duration)

**Transdermal patch (Duragesic):**
- For chronic pain only (NOT acute pain)
- 12-100 mcg/hr patch, change every 72 hours

**Intranasal (IN) - off-label for field use:**
- 1-2 mcg/kg (50-200mcg) - rapid onset, useful in tactical/wilderness settings

**Advantages:**
- Rapid onset (1-2 minutes IV)
- Short duration (30-60 minutes IV) - easy to titrate
- Less histamine release than morphine (more hemodynamically stable)
- Very potent (100x more potent than morphine mcg for mcg)

**Disadvantages:**
- Respiratory depression (worse than morphine in overdose)
- Very short duration (requires frequent redosing or infusion)
- **EXTREMELY POTENT** (illicit fentanyl major cause of overdose deaths)
- Expensive

## Opioid Side Effects and Management

### Common Side Effects (Manage Proactively)

**Constipation (Almost Universal):**
- Mechanism: Opioids slow GI motility
- Prevention: Start bowel regimen SAME DAY as opioid
  - Stool softener: Docusate (Colace) 100mg twice daily
  - Stimulant laxative: Senna (Senokot) 2 tablets at bedtime OR Bisacodyl (Dulcolax) 10mg at bedtime
  - Osmotic laxative: Polyethylene glycol (Miralax) 17g daily
- Goal: Bowel movement every 1-2 days
- If no BM in 3 days: Add suppository (bisacodyl or glycerin) or enema

**Nausea (30-40% of patients):**
- Usually improves after 3-5 days (tolerance develops)
- Treatment:
  - Ondansetron (Zofran) 4-8mg every 8 hours OR
  - Promethazine (Phenergan) 12.5-25mg every 6 hours OR
  - Meclizine (Antivert) 25mg every 8 hours
- Take opioid with food (reduces nausea)

**Sedation:**
- Common initially (first 3-5 days)
- Usually improves with tolerance
- Warn patient: No driving, operating machinery
- If excessive: Reduce dose or switch opioid

**Itching (10-20%):**
- Mechanism: Histamine release (especially morphine)
- Treatment:
  - Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 25-50mg every 6 hours OR
  - Hydroxyzine 25mg every 6 hours
- Switch to different opioid if severe (fentanyl, hydromorphone have less histamine release)

### Serious Side Effects (Monitor Closely)

**Respiratory Depression:**
- Most serious complication (can be fatal)
- Risk factors: High dose, opioid-naive patient, elderly, combined with alcohol/benzodiazepines, sleep apnea
- Signs: Respiratory rate <10 breaths/minute, shallow breathing, unresponsive
- **Treatment:** Naloxone (Narcan) - see below

**Overdose:**
- **Signs:**
  - Pinpoint pupils (miosis)
  - Respiratory depression (rate <10/min) or apnea (stopped breathing)
  - Decreased level of consciousness (unarousable)
- **Treatment:** Naloxone (Narcan)
  - Intranasal: 4mg (1 spray per nostril) - repeat every 2-3 minutes if no response
  - IM/IV: 0.4-2mg - repeat every 2-3 minutes (max 10mg)
  - If no response after 10mg naloxone, consider other cause (not opioid overdose)
  - Duration: 30-90 minutes (shorter than most opioids) - **may need repeated doses or infusion**
  - Side effect: Precipitates withdrawal (patient wakes up agitated, in pain)

---

## Opioid Safety and Addiction Prevention

### Addiction vs. Physical Dependence vs. Tolerance

**Addiction (Psychological Dependence):**
- Compulsive drug-seeking despite harm
- Loss of control (taking more than prescribed)
- Continued use despite negative consequences
- **Risk factors:** Personal/family history of substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, younger age

**Physical Dependence:**
- Body adapts to opioid presence (normal physiological response)
- Withdrawal symptoms if stopped abruptly
- **NOT the same as addiction** (even appropriate use causes dependence)

**Tolerance:**
- Decreasing effect with same dose (need higher dose for same pain relief)
- Develops over weeks-months
- Normal phenomenon

### Minimizing Addiction Risk

**Prescribing practices:**
1. **Assess risk:** Screen for addiction history (CAGE questions, Opioid Risk Tool)
2. **Lowest effective dose:** Start low, titrate to pain control
3. **Short duration:** 3-7 days for acute pain (fracture, surgery, trauma)
   - Longer duration = higher addiction risk
4. **Scheduled weaning:** Taper dose (don't stop abruptly) - reduces withdrawal
5. **Non-opioid alternatives:** Maximize Step 1 medications, consider non-pharmacological

**Red flags (possible misuse):**
- Requesting early refills consistently
- "Lost" prescriptions
- Seeking prescriptions from multiple providers
- Crushing/snorting tablets
- Aggressive behavior when questioned about use

### Weaning Opioids (Preventing Withdrawal)

**Short-term use (<7 days):**
- Can stop abruptly (minimal dependence)

**Medium-term use (1-4 weeks):**
- Taper 25-50% every 2-3 days

**Long-term use (>1 month):**
- Taper 10-25% per week (slower = fewer withdrawal symptoms)
- **Example:** Patient on morphine 30mg every 4 hours (180mg/day total)
  - Week 1: Reduce to 150mg/day (25mg every 4 hours)
  - Week 2: Reduce to 120mg/day (20mg every 4 hours)
  - Week 3: Reduce to 90mg/day (15mg every 4 hours)
  - Continue until off

**Withdrawal symptoms:**
- Mild: Anxiety, sweating, runny nose, muscle aches, insomnia
- Moderate: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, goosebumps, dilated pupils
- Severe: Severe cramping, agitation (rare, usually only with abrupt cessation of high doses)
- **Not life-threatening** (uncomfortable, but not dangerous like alcohol/benzo withdrawal)

**Managing withdrawal:**
- Clonidine 0.1-0.2mg every 6 hours (reduces sympathetic symptoms: sweating, anxiety)
- Ibuprofen 400-600mg every 6 hours (muscle aches)
- Loperamide (Imodium) for diarrhea
- Ondansetron (Zofran) for nausea

---

## Adjuvant Medications (Enhance Analgesia)

**Use in combination with analgesic ladder to enhance pain control.**

### For Neuropathic Pain (Nerve Pain)

**Characteristics:** Burning, shooting, electric-like, tingling, numbness

**Medications:**

**Gabapentin (Neurontin):**
- Dosing: Start 300mg at bedtime, increase by 300mg every 3 days
  - Typical dose: 300-600mg three times daily (900-1800mg/day)
  - Maximum: 3600mg/day
- Advantages: Well-tolerated, non-addictive
- Disadvantages: Sedation (especially initially), takes 1-2 weeks for full effect
- Uses: Diabetic neuropathy, shingles (postherpetic neuralgia), nerve injury

**Pregabalin (Lyrica):**
- Similar to gabapentin, faster onset
- Dosing: 75-150mg twice daily
- Controlled substance (Schedule V) - mild abuse potential

**Amitriptyline (Tricyclic Antidepressant):**
- Dosing: 10-25mg at bedtime, increase weekly
  - Typical dose: 50-75mg at bedtime
- Advantages: Also improves sleep
- Disadvantages: Anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), sedation
- Contraindications: Recent heart attack, glaucoma, severe enlarged prostate

### For Muscle Spasm

**Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril):**
- Dosing: 5-10mg three times daily (short-term: 2-3 weeks)
- Mechanism: Centrally-acting muscle relaxant
- Side effects: Sedation, dry mouth

**Methocarbamol (Robaxin):**
- Dosing: 1500mg four times daily for 2-3 days, then 1000mg four times daily
- Less sedating than cyclobenzaprine

**Baclofen:**
- Dosing: 5mg three times daily, increase by 5mg every 3 days (max 80mg/day)
- For spasticity (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury)

### For Bone Pain

**Bisphosphonates:**
- Used for cancer bone metastases, osteoporosis pain
- Not immediate effect (takes days-weeks)
- Examples: Pamidronate, zoledronic acid (IV)

### Corticosteroids (for Inflammatory Pain, Nerve Compression)

**Dexamethasone:**
- Dosing: 4-8mg IV/PO once or twice daily
- Uses: Spinal cord compression, brain tumor swelling, severe inflammatory pain
- Short-term use only (side effects accumulate: diabetes, infections, osteoporosis)

---

## Non-Pharmacological Pain Management

**Always incorporate alongside medications** (synergistic effect).

### Physical Methods

**Cold Therapy (First 48-72 Hours After Injury):**
- Ice pack 20 minutes every 2-3 hours
- Reduces inflammation, swelling, pain
- Uses: Sprains, strains, fractures, bruises, acute injuries

**Heat Therapy (After 72 Hours, or for Chronic Pain):**
- Heating pad, warm compress 20-30 minutes
- Increases blood flow, relaxes muscles
- Uses: Muscle spasms, arthritis, chronic back pain

**Elevation:**
- Elevate injured extremity above heart
- Reduces swelling, throbbing pain
- Uses: Sprains, fractures, post-surgical

**Immobilization/Splinting:**
- Stabilizes injury (prevents further damage, reduces pain)
- Uses: Fractures, sprains, joint injuries

**Positioning:**
- Find position of comfort (often flexion for back pain, sitting upright for chest pain)
- Use pillows, cushions to support

### Psychological/Cognitive Methods

**Distraction:**
- Music, movies, conversation, games
- Particularly effective in children
- Reduces pain perception (brain can't focus on everything)

**Relaxation Techniques:**
- Deep breathing (slow, controlled breaths)
- Progressive muscle relaxation (tense and release muscle groups)
- Guided imagery (visualize peaceful scene)
- Reduces anxiety (anxiety amplifies pain perception)

**Mindfulness/Meditation:**
- Focus on present moment, accept pain without judgment
- Effective for chronic pain (changes relationship with pain)

### Procedural Techniques

**Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):**
- Electrical impulses block pain signals to brain
- Effective for some chronic pain (back pain, arthritis)
- Requires TENS device

**Massage:**
- Increases blood flow, releases muscle tension
- Effective for muscle pain, tension headaches

**Acupuncture:**
- Traditional Chinese medicine (needle insertion at specific points)
- Some evidence for chronic pain (low back, neck, osteoarthritis)

---

## Special Populations

### Children

**Pain assessment:**
- <3 years: FLACC scale (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability)
- 3-7 years: FACES pain scale
- >7 years: Numeric 0-10 scale

**Medication dosing:**
- **Always dose by weight** (mg/kg)
- See pediatric dosing entry for specific doses

**Special considerations:**
- Avoid aspirin (<18 years - Reye's syndrome)
- Codeine: Generally avoid (<12 years - ultra-rapid metabolizer risk)
- Tramadol: Avoid <12 years
- Fear/anxiety amplifies pain in children - distraction, parent presence critical

### Elderly

**Challenges:**
- Multiple comorbidities (heart, kidney, liver disease)
- Polypharmacy (drug interactions)
- Increased sensitivity to opioids (start with 50% usual dose)
- Cognitive impairment (may not report pain accurately)

**Special considerations:**
- NSAIDs higher risk (GI bleeding, kidney damage)
- Opioids: Start low, go slow (respiratory depression, falls risk from sedation)
- Constipation especially problematic (aggressive bowel regimen)
- Consider acetaminophen as first-line (safer than NSAIDs in elderly)

### Pregnancy

**Safe medications:**
- Acetaminophen: Safe (Category B) - preferred analgesic in pregnancy
- Opioids: Category B/C (safe short-term, but neonatal withdrawal if chronic use)
- Local anesthetics: Lidocaine safe

**Avoid:**
- NSAIDs (third trimester - premature closure of ductus arteriosus)
- Aspirin (bleeding risk, except low-dose for preeclampsia prevention)

### Renal (Kidney) Disease

**Avoid or reduce dose:**
- NSAIDs (worsen kidney function)
- Morphine (toxic metabolites accumulate)
- Meperidine (Demerol) - toxic metabolite causes seizures

**Safer options:**
- Acetaminophen (no dose adjustment needed)
- Hydromorphone (less accumulation than morphine)
- Fentanyl (doesn't rely on kidney clearance)

### Liver Disease

**Avoid or reduce dose:**
- Acetaminophen (reduced maximum dose: 2000mg/day in severe liver disease)
- All opioids (metabolized by liver - dose reduction needed)

**Safer options:**
- NSAIDs (if kidney function intact)

---

## Acute Pain by Condition

### Fractures

**Ladder step:** Step 2-3 (moderate to severe pain)
**Duration:** Days to weeks (decreases as healing progresses)
**First-line:**
- Ibuprofen 600-800mg every 6 hours (reduces inflammation, bone healing) + Acetaminophen 1000mg alternating
- If inadequate: Add opioid (tramadol 50-100mg OR oxycodone 5-10mg) every 4-6 hours for first 3-5 days
- Wean opioid by day 5-7 (continue NSAIDs for 2-3 weeks)
**Non-pharmacological:** Immobilization (splint, cast), ice first 48 hours, elevation

### Post-Surgical Pain

**Ladder step:** Step 2-3 initially, wean to Step 1
**Duration:** 3-7 days (varies by procedure)
**Protocol:**
- Days 1-3: Opioid (oxycodone 5-10mg OR hydrocodone 5-10mg) every 4-6 hours + Ibuprofen 600mg every 6 hours
- Days 4-5: Reduce opioid dose by 50%
- Days 6-7: Discontinue opioid, continue ibuprofen + acetaminophen
- Days 8+: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed

### Burns

**Ladder step:** Step 2-3 (severe pain, especially dressing changes)
**Pain types:**
- Background pain: Constant burning (step 2-3 long-acting opioid)
- Breakthrough pain: Dressing changes, wound care (short-acting opioid 30 min before)
**First-line:**
- Oxycodone ER 10-20mg every 12 hours (background pain)
- Morphine IR 5-15mg 30 minutes before dressing change
- Ibuprofen 600-800mg every 6 hours (inflammation)
**Non-pharmacological:** Cool (not ice cold) water for first-degree burns, occlusive dressings (reduces air exposure = reduces pain)

### Kidney Stones

**Ladder step:** Step 3 (severe, colicky pain)
**First-line:**
- Ketorolac (Toradol) 30mg IV (or 10mg PO) - NSAID, very effective for renal colic
- Morphine 5-10mg IV OR Hydromorphone 1-2mg IV (if inadequate response)
- Ondansetron 4-8mg IV (nausea common with kidney stones)
**Hydration:** IV fluids to promote stone passage

### Headache (Severe, including Migraine)

**Ladder step:** Step 1-2 usually sufficient
**First-line:**
- Ibuprofen 800mg OR Naproxen 500mg
- Acetaminophen 1000mg
- Caffeine 100-200mg (enhances analgesic effect)
**Migraine-specific:**
- Sumatriptan 50-100mg PO (or 6mg SC) - vasoconstrictor, aborts migraine
- Prochlorperazine (Compazine) 10mg IV/PO - antiemetic, also analgesic for migraine
**Non-pharmacological:** Dark, quiet room; cold compress on forehead; hydration

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Undertreating pain ("tough it out") | Adequate analgesia promotes healing, prevents chronic pain |
| Jumping to Step 3 for mild pain | Start at appropriate ladder step, titrate upward |
| PRN-only dosing for constant pain | Scheduled dosing (prevents pain) + PRN for breakthrough |
| Not starting bowel regimen with opioids | Start stool softener + stimulant laxative same day as opioid |
| Stopping opioids abruptly after weeks of use | Taper dose (10-25% per week) to prevent withdrawal |
| Using NSAIDs long-term without monitoring | Risk of GI bleeding, kidney damage - limit to <10 days or monitor closely |
| Combining opioids with alcohol/benzodiazepines | Synergistic respiratory depression - potentially fatal |
| Giving aspirin to children with viral illness | Reye's syndrome risk - use acetaminophen or ibuprofen instead |

## When to Seek Medical Care

**Immediate evaluation needed if:**
- Pain uncontrolled despite Step 3 medications
- Signs of opioid overdose (respiratory depression, unresponsive, pinpoint pupils)
- New symptoms suggesting serious condition (chest pain, severe headache with neck stiffness, abdominal pain with fever)
- Addiction concerns (compulsive use, doctor shopping, withdrawal)

**Follow-up needed if:**
- Pain persists >7-10 days without improvement
- Side effects intolerable (severe nausea, confusion, rash)
- Chronic pain (>3 months) - needs multimodal approach, possible referral to pain specialist
