summary: Emergency management of venomous and non-venomous snakebites in field conditions.
steps:
- Move away from the snake; do not attempt to capture or kill it.
- Keep patient calm and still — movement increases venom spread.
- Remove rings, watches, tight clothing near the bite (swelling will occur).
- Immobilize the bitten limb at or below heart level.
- Mark the edge of swelling with pen and time to track progression.
- Evacuate to medical facility for antivenom as soon as possible.
warnings:
- Do NOT cut the wound, suck venom, apply tourniquet, or use ice.
- Pressure immobilization bandage only for neurotoxic snakes (e.g., coral snakes,
  cobras).
- Even 'dry bites' (no venom) can become infected — monitor all bites.
- Identification of snake species helps treatment — photograph if safely possible.
