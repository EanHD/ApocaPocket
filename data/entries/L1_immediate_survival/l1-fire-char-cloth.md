summary: Char cloth is cotton fabric converted to carbon through pyrolysis (heating without oxygen). It catches the smallest sparks from flint-and-steel, ferro rods, or even bow drill embers. One batch
  lasts months. Essential for primitive and traditional fire starting.
warnings:
- The charring process produces flammable gases — keep the tin AWAY from direct flame contact to prevent the gas jet from igniting the cloth inside
- Char cloth is extremely fragile — handle gently and store in a rigid container, not a plastic bag
- Only use 100% cotton or linen fabric — synthetic fabrics melt instead of charring and produce toxic fumes
- The tin will be very hot during and after charring — use tongs or gloves
steps:
- 'MATERIALS: 100% cotton fabric (old t-shirt, denim, bandana), a metal tin with a tight-fitting lid (Altoids tin is classic, any small metal container works). Punch ONE small hole in the lid — needle-sized
  — for gas to escape.'
- Cut fabric into 1-2 inch squares. Pack them loosely into the tin — don't compress. They need some air space between layers. Fill the tin but don't cram.
- Place the sealed tin on hot coals (not in direct flame). You'll see a jet of smoke/flame coming from the pin hole — this is volatile gases escaping. The process is working.
- 'When the smoke jet stops or becomes very thin (10-20 minutes depending on tin size), the charring is complete. Remove tin from heat. IMPORTANT: plug the hole with a small stick or clay immediately —
  if air enters while hot, the char cloth will ignite and burn to ash.'
- Let the tin cool completely before opening (30+ minutes). If cloth is still brown in spots, char again. Properly charred cloth is uniformly black, fragile, and has a silky sheen. It should NOT crumble
  to dust — that's over-charred.
- 'TO USE: place a piece of char cloth on top of flint or next to your tinder. Strike steel against flint to produce sparks (sharp edge of flint, use the spine of a carbon steel knife — stainless steel
  won''t spark). A spark landing on char cloth produces a growing red ember.'
- Transfer the glowing char cloth into a tinder bundle (dry grass nest, cedar bark, etc.). Fold tinder around it gently and blow with steady breaths until it bursts into flame.
- 'ALTERNATIVE CHAR MATERIALS: punk wood (soft rotted wood), cattail pith, and dried fungi (amadou from horse hoof fungus) can also be charred. Punk wood char catches sparks almost as well as cloth.'
- 'STORAGE: keep char cloth absolutely dry in a sealed metal tin. A single Altoids tin holds enough char cloth for 30-50 fires. Make new batches whenever you have a campfire — it costs nothing.'
