summary: Critical differentiation and aggressive cooling protocols for heat exhaustion vs heat stroke with specific temperature targets and evacuation criteria.
steps:
- Immediately move victim to cool, shaded area with good airflow.
- Remove excess clothing, protective gear, wet clothing.
- Assess mental status and core temperature (rectal if possible, or estimate).
- Differentiate heat exhaustion (intact mental status) from heat stroke (altered mental status).
- For heat stroke - AGGRESSIVE COOLING FIRST, then assess ABCs.
- Apply cold water to entire body, especially head, neck, armpits, groin.
- Create airflow with fanning to maximize evaporative cooling.
- Apply ice packs (wrapped) to neck, armpits, groin if available.
- Monitor temperature every 5-10 minutes - target 38.5-39°C (101-102°F).
- For heat exhaustion - give oral fluids if conscious and able to swallow.
- For heat stroke - DO NOT give oral fluids until mental status improves.
- Prepare for seizures and vomiting - position appropriately.
- Continue cooling during evacuation - this is time-critical emergency.
warnings:
- Heat stroke is IMMEDIATE LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY - brain damage begins within minutes.
- Do NOT delay cooling to transport - cool first, transport while continuing cooling.
- Never give oral fluids to unconscious or altered mental status patients.
- Overcooling risk - stop active cooling at 38.5-39°C to prevent hypothermia.
- Seizures are common in heat stroke - protect head but do not restrain.
- Children and elderly deteriorate faster - lower threshold for aggressive treatment.

## Overview
Heat illness ranges from mild heat cramps to life-threatening heat stroke. **Heat stroke is a TRUE EMERGENCY** - mortality is 10-50% even with treatment, higher without. Core body temperature >40°C (104°F) causes direct brain cell death within minutes. Immediate aggressive cooling is the ONLY effective treatment.

**Critical concept:** Cool first, transport second. Every minute at >40°C increases permanent brain damage.

## Heat Illness Spectrum

| Condition | Core Temp | Mental Status | Sweating | Urgency |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Heat Cramps** | Normal | Normal | Present | Low |
| **Heat Exhaustion** | 37-40°C (98.6-104°F) | Normal | Present (usually) | Moderate |
| **Heat Stroke** | >40°C (>104°F) | **ALTERED** | Often absent | **CRITICAL** |

## Differentiating Heat Exhaustion vs Heat Stroke

### Heat Exhaustion (Moderate Urgency)

**Key feature:** Mental status NORMAL (alert, oriented, appropriate responses)

**Signs/Symptoms:**
- Core temperature <40°C (104°F)
- Heavy sweating (usually)
- Weakness, fatigue
- Dizziness, lightheadedness
- Headache
- Nausea, vomiting possible
- Muscle cramps
- Pale, cool, clammy skin
- Fast, weak pulse
- Normal mental function

**Prognosis:** Recovers with rest, cooling, and fluids

### Heat Stroke (LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY)

**Key feature:** Mental status ALTERED (confused, combative, lethargic, unconscious)

**Signs/Symptoms:**
- Core temperature >40°C (104°F), often >41°C (106°F)
- **Altered mental status** - confusion, delirium, combativeness, seizures, coma
- Hot, dry skin (but 50% still sweat!)
- Rapid, strong pulse initially (may weaken in shock)
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Seizures (common)
- Vomiting
- Ataxia (stumbling, poor coordination)

**Prognosis:** High mortality without immediate cooling. Permanent brain/organ damage common.

### The Critical Question

**"What day is it? Where are we? What's your name?"**
- Answers correctly = likely heat exhaustion
- Confused, slow response, or incorrect = HEAT STROKE

**Do NOT wait for high temperature measurement to diagnose** - altered mental status in hot environment = heat stroke until proven otherwise

## Step-by-Step Treatment Protocol

### Heat Exhaustion Treatment

#### 1. Move to Cool Environment (Immediately)
- Shade, air-conditioned space, or cool building
- Good airflow essential
- Out of direct sunlight

#### 2. Remove Excess Clothing
- Take off unnecessary layers
- Loosen tight clothing
- Remove PPE, helmets, body armor if applicable

#### 3. Passive Cooling
- Lay flat, elevate legs slightly (if no nausea)
- Apply cool, wet cloths to forehead, neck
- Fan to create airflow
- Drink cool (not ice cold) fluids

#### 4. Oral Rehydration
**If conscious and not vomiting:**
- Water or oral rehydration solution (see l1-medical-oral-rehydration-recipe)
- 250-500 mL (8-16 oz) over first 15 minutes
- Then 250 mL every 15-20 minutes
- Total: 1-2 liters over first hour
- Add pinch of salt if only water available

**If vomiting or nauseous:**
- Small sips (1-2 oz every 5 minutes)
- If continues vomiting, stop oral fluids - needs IV (evacuate)

#### 5. Monitor for 2-4 Hours
- Temperature (if measurable)
- Mental status
- Continue hydration
- Watch for progression to heat stroke

**Expected improvement:**
- Feeling better within 30-60 minutes
- Temperature normalizing
- No mental status changes

**If NOT improving or mental status changes:** Treat as heat stroke

### Heat Stroke Treatment (EMERGENCY PROTOCOL)

**TIME IS BRAIN** - Each minute >40°C causes irreversible damage

#### 1. Call for Help/Plan Evacuation (30 seconds)
- Send someone for emergency services
- Prepare for rapid evacuation
- **DO NOT delay cooling to transport**

#### 2. Assess ABCs (30 seconds)
- Airway patent?
- Breathing present?
- Pulse present?
- If absent, start CPR

#### 3. Immediate Aggressive Cooling (PRIMARY TREATMENT)

**GOAL: Reduce core temperature to 38.5-39°C (101-102°F) within 30 minutes**

**Method 1: Cold Water Immersion (MOST EFFECTIVE)**
- Submerge in cold water (bathtub, stream, lake, kiddie pool)
- Keep head above water
- Water temperature: 10-20°C (50-68°F)
- Remove when temperature reaches 39°C (102°F)
- Cooling rate: 0.15-0.3°C per minute

**Method 2: Evaporative Cooling (If no immersion available)**
- Remove all clothing
- Wet entire body with cool/room temperature water
- Continuous spraying or sponging
- **Vigorous fanning** to maximize evaporation (critical!)
- Reapply water continuously - must stay wet
- This is nearly as effective as immersion if done aggressively

**Method 3: Ice Pack Application**
- Ice packs (wrapped in cloth, not directly on skin) to:
  - Neck (carotid arteries)
  - Armpits (axillary arteries)
  - Groin (femoral arteries)
- Also apply to head if available
- Replace as they warm

**Method 4: Combination Approach (BEST if resources available)**
- Cold water immersion PLUS ice packs
- Or evaporative cooling PLUS ice packs PLUS vigorous fanning

**What NOT to do:**
- Do NOT give antipyretics (Tylenol, ibuprofen) - they don't work for heat stroke
- Do NOT give oral fluids until mental status improves
- Do NOT use alcohol rubs (toxic absorption)
- Do NOT stop cooling to transport - cool while transporting

#### 4. Monitor Core Temperature (Every 5-10 minutes)

**Best:** Rectal temperature (most accurate)
**Acceptable:** Oral (if conscious), tympanic (ear)
**Avoid:** Axillary (armpit) - unreliable
**If no thermometer:** Assess by touch and mental status improvement

**Target:** 38.5-39°C (101-102°F)
**Stop active cooling at:** 39°C (102°F) to prevent overcooling
**Continue monitoring:** Temperature can rebound

#### 5. Position and Airway Management
- Place in recovery position if unconscious (on side)
- Protect airway if vomiting
- Be prepared for seizures

#### 6. Seizure Management (If Occurs)
- Do NOT restrain
- Protect head from injury (cushion with clothing)
- Turn on side if possible
- Time the seizure
- Continue cooling during seizure
- See l1-medical-seizures entry

#### 7. DO NOT Give Oral Fluids Yet
- Wait until mental status improves
- Risk of aspiration (choking)
- Will need IV fluids - part of hospital treatment

#### 8. Continue Cooling During Evacuation
- Wet towels/clothing
- Ice packs if available
- Fanning
- Monitor temperature continuously

## Temperature Measurement Techniques

### Rectal (Most Accurate for Core)
- Gold standard for heat stroke
- Insert thermometer 2-3 inches (5-7 cm)
- Hold for 3 minutes (non-digital) or until beep
- Normal: 36.5-37.5°C (97.7-99.5°F)

### Oral
- Under tongue, mouth closed
- Not accurate if recently drank cold water
- Normal: 36-37°C (96.8-98.6°F)

### Axillary (Armpit) - Least Reliable
- Add 1°C (1.8°F) to reading for approximate core temp
- Very inaccurate in heat illness

### Field Estimation (No Thermometer)
- Hot to touch + altered mental status = assume >40°C
- Cool entire, evaporative cooling, monitor mental status improvement

## Risk Factors

### Personal
- Age <4 or >65 years
- Obesity
- Dehydration
- Poor physical fitness
- Lack of acclimatization
- Alcohol/drug use
- Certain medications (see below)

### Environmental
- High temperature >32°C (90°F)
- High humidity >60% (reduces sweat evaporation)
- Direct sun exposure
- Lack of breeze/airflow
- Urban heat island effect

### Activity
- Heavy exertion
- Inadequate rest breaks
- Inadequate fluid intake
- Inappropriate clothing (heavy, dark, non-breathable)

### Medical Conditions
- Heart disease
- Diabetes
- Mental illness
- Previous heat stroke (high risk for recurrence)

### Medications That Increase Risk
- Diuretics ("water pills")
- Beta-blockers
- Antihistamines
- Antipsychotics
- Stimulants
- Anticholinergics

## Acclimatization

**Why it matters:** Takes 7-14 days to adapt to heat
- Increased sweat production
- Earlier sweat onset
- More dilute sweat (conserves salt)
- Increased plasma volume
- Better cardiovascular response

**Gradual exposure protocol:**
- Day 1-2: 20-30% normal work in heat
- Day 3-4: 40-50% normal work
- Day 5-7: 60-80% normal work
- Day 8-14: Full work capacity

**Lost rapidly:** 75% of acclimatization lost in 7-10 days away from heat

## Prevention Strategies

### Hydration
- Drink BEFORE thirsty
- Clear or pale urine = well hydrated
- General: 250 mL every 15-20 minutes during activity
- More in extreme heat/humidity

### Cooling Breaks
- 10-15 minutes rest per hour in heat
- Shade and airflow during breaks
- Remove PPE/equipment temporarily

### Clothing
- Light-colored, loose, breathable
- Hat with brim (shade)
- Moisture-wicking fabrics

### Work Modification
- Heaviest work during cooler parts of day (early morning/evening)
- Buddy system - watch each other for signs
- Acclimatize gradually

### Recognize Early Signs
- Dizziness, nausea
- Headache
- Heavy sweating or sudden stop sweating
- Irritability

**Stop activity immediately if early signs appear**

## Complications of Heat Stroke

### Acute (First 24-48 hours)
- Seizures
- Cerebral edema (brain swelling)
- Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown → kidney failure)
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC - bleeding disorder)
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Liver failure
- Kidney failure

### Chronic (Long-term)
- Permanent brain damage (cerebellar dysfunction common)
- Heat intolerance (lifelong increased risk)
- Chronic fatigue
- Personality changes
- Coordination problems

**Mortality:** 10-50% depending on duration at high temperature and treatment speed

## Special Populations

### Children
- Higher surface area to mass ratio (heat up faster)
- Less efficient sweating
- Lower thirst drive
- Depend on adults for hydration

### Elderly
- Decreased thirst sensation
- Impaired sweating response
- Multiple medications
- Chronic medical conditions
- May not sense heat

### Athletes
- "Push through" mentality dangerous
- Exertional heat stroke can occur even in moderate temperatures
- Young, fit athletes still at risk

### Obese Individuals
- Greater heat production
- Reduced heat dissipation
- Increased exertion for same activity

## Evacuation Criteria

### IMMEDIATE Evacuation (Heat Stroke)
- ANY altered mental status in heat exposure
- Core temperature >40°C (104°F)
- Seizure
- Unconsciousness
- Not improving with cooling after 20-30 minutes

### URGENT Evacuation (Heat Exhaustion Not Improving)
- Persistent vomiting (cannot hydrate orally)
- Not improving after 2-4 hours rest and hydration
- Unable to tolerate oral fluids
- Weakness prevents safe travel

### Can Monitor in Field
- Heat exhaustion improving with treatment
- Alert and oriented
- Tolerating oral fluids
- Temperature normalizing
- No concerning symptoms developing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Delaying cooling to transport patient
- ❌ Giving only ice packs without full-body cooling (insufficient)
- ❌ Stopping cooling too early (before 39°C)
- ❌ Giving Tylenol/Ibuprofen (doesn't work for heat stroke)
- ❌ Giving oral fluids to altered patient (aspiration risk)
- ❌ Using ice water for heat exhaustion (unnecessary, uncomfortable)
- ❌ Assuming no sweating = heat stroke (50% of heat stroke victims still sweat)
- ❌ Not creating airflow for evaporative cooling (critical component)
- ❌ Waiting for high temperature measurement to act (mental status change IS the diagnosis)
