summary: 'Creating fire by friction - spinning wood against wood generates heat (ember). Methods: bow drill (easiest), hand drill (hardest), fire plow. Requires dry softwoods, proper technique, patience.
  Success rate low for beginners but achievable with practice.'
warnings:
- Friction fire is extremely difficult and time-consuming - use modern methods when available
- Requires bone-dry wood - impossible in rain or high humidity
- Blisters on hands are common with hand drill
- Friction methods rarely work first try - practice before you need it
steps:
- 'BOW DRILL: (1) PARTS: Fireboard (flat softwood), spindle (round stick), bow (curved stick with cordage), handhold (stone or wood with socket). (2) Cut V-notch in fireboard (catches coal). (3) Bow string
  wrapped once around spindle. (4) Spindle vertical on fireboard, handhold on top. (5) Bow back and forth (spins spindle). (6) Downward pressure + speed = smoke, then ember in notch. (7) Transfer ember
  to tinder bundle, blow gently.'
- 'WOOD SELECTION: Dry softwoods work best. Cedar, cottonwood, willow, basswood. Spindle and fireboard should be same or similar hardness.'
- 'HAND DRILL: No bow - spin spindle between palms. Very difficult (blisters). Use long thin spindle, downward pressure as you spin.'
- 'FIRE PLOW: Rub hardwood stick in groove on softwood board. Creates ember at end of groove. Rare technique.'
