# Vehicle Winter Survival

## Overview

100+ Americans die yearly from winter vehicle stranding. **Stay with vehicle, run engine safely, signal for help = survival.**

**CRITICAL:** Carbon monoxide poisoning kills more stranded motorists than cold. Exhaust must be clear.

---

## When to Stay vs When to Go

**STAY with vehicle if:**
- Blizzard/whiteout conditions (can't see 100 feet)
- Night time (rescuers can't see you, you can't navigate)
- Unfamiliar area (don't know distance to help)
- Help is uncertain (<1 mile certain = maybe walk, >1 mile = stay)
- Elderly, children, injured, or hypothermic passengers

**GO (walk out) ONLY if:**
- Building/town visible (<1 mile, clear conditions)
- Vehicle unsafe (fire, flood, avalanche path)
- Road has traffic (stay on road, flag down cars)
- Cell service confirmed help is coming to specific location

⚠️ **STATISTIC:** 75% of stranded motorist deaths occur when people leave their vehicle.

## Running Engine Safely (Carbon Monoxide Prevention)

**"10 minutes every hour" rule:**
- Run engine 10 minutes per hour for heat
- Turn OFF engine for 50 minutes (conserves fuel)
- Repeat cycle

**CO poisoning prevention (CRITICAL!):**
1. **Check exhaust pipe every hour:**
   - Clear snow/ice from tailpipe
   - Ensure 3+ feet clearance behind vehicle
   - Snow drifts can bury exhaust in 20-30 minutes
   
2. **Crack window 1 inch:**
   - Even with clear exhaust, crack window
   - Prevents CO buildup from leaks
   - Yes, it's cold, but CO kills faster than cold
   
3. **CO symptoms (recognize early):**
   - Headache (first sign, often dismissed as "just cold")
   - Dizziness, confusion
   - Nausea, vomiting
   - Drowsiness (dangerous, leads to unconsciousness)
   - Cherry-red skin (late sign, often not present)

**If CO symptoms appear:**
- Turn OFF engine immediately
- Open all windows
- Exit vehicle (get fresh air)
- Do NOT run engine again until exhaust cleared

## Insulation Techniques

**Goal:** Trap body heat, reduce heat loss through windows/doors

**Floor mats on roof:**
- Remove rubber floor mats
- Place on roof (exterior) over driver/passenger area
- Reduces radiant heat loss through metal roof
- R-value improvement: ~R-1 to R-2

**Newspaper/cardboard in doors:**
- Stuff newspaper, cardboard, clothing in door panels
- Reduces drafts, cold air infiltration
- Windows are major heat loss (single-pane glass)

**Window covers:**
- Emergency blankets (silver side IN, reflects heat back)
- Cardboard, clothing, floor mats over windows
- Leave driver's window partially clear (see rescuers)
- Front windshield: cover at night, uncover during day (solar gain)

**Clothing layers:**
- Layer all available clothing (more layers = more insulation)
- Hat critical (30-40% heat loss through head)
- Gloves, socks (extremities freeze first)
- Huddle together (share body heat)

## Body Heat Retention

**Heat conservation strategies:**
1. **Exercise periodically:**
   - Isometric exercises (tense muscles without moving)
   - Arm circles, leg lifts (inside vehicle)
   - DO NOT sweat (wet = cold)
   - Goal: generate heat without moisture buildup
   
2. **Huddle together:**
   - Sit close, share blankets
   - Kids in middle (lose heat fastest)
   - Elderly on ends (easiest to monitor)
   
3. **Avoid sleeping:**
   - Hypothermia risk increases during sleep
   - Take turns staying awake (watch for hypothermia symptoms in others)
   - If must sleep: 1-2 hour shifts, set alarm
   
4. **Eat high-calorie foods:**
   - Body burns 2-3x more calories in cold
   - Fat, protein preferred (slow-burn energy)
   - Sugary snacks quick energy but short-lived

**Hypothermia signs:**
- Shivering (early sign, good - body still fighting)
- Confusion, slurred speech (moderate hypothermia)
- Drowsiness, apathy (severe hypothermia)
- Shivering stops (DANGEROUS - body giving up)

**Treatment:**
- Remove wet clothing
- Add dry layers
- Warm slowly (run engine, share body heat)
- Warm sweet drinks (if conscious)
- DO NOT rub extremities (causes frostbite damage)

## Snow Melting for Water

**DO NOT eat snow directly:**
- Lowers core body temperature (2°F drop per pound of snow)
- Causes dehydration (body uses energy to melt snow)
- Can cause hypothermia

**Safe snow melting:**
1. **Body heat method:**
   - Fill water bottle with snow
   - Place inside jacket against chest/stomach
   - Takes 30-60 minutes to melt
   
2. **Engine heat:**
   - Metal can/bottle on engine block
   - Check every 5-10 minutes (don't overheat)
   
3. **Sunlight:**
   - Dark container (absorbs heat)
   - Place on dashboard in sun
   - Takes 2-4 hours

**Ice vs snow:**
- Ice provides 2x water per volume
- Clear ice safer than cloudy ice
- Melt ice first, add snow to water (faster)

---

## Signaling Techniques

**Goal:** Make vehicle visible from ground and air

**Daytime signals:**
1. **Bright cloth on antenna:**
   - Orange, red, or bright cloth
   - Visible from 1-2 miles
   - Flaps in wind (motion attracts attention)
   
2. **Reflective triangles:**
   - Place 50-100 feet ahead and behind vehicle
   - Standard safety equipment in most vehicles
   
3. **SOS in snow:**
   - Stomp large SOS (letters 10+ feet tall)
   - Fill with dark material (branches, dirt, oil)
   - Visible from aircraft
   
4. **Mirror signals:**
   - Rearview mirror, CD, phone screen
   - Flash sunlight toward road, aircraft
   - Visible 10+ miles on clear day

**Night signals:**
1. **Dome light:**
   - Turn on when you hear vehicle approaching
   - Conserve battery (turn off between)
   
2. **Headlights:**
   - Flash high beams (SOS: 3 short, 3 long, 3 short)
   - Drains battery quickly (use sparingly)
   
3. **Flashlight:**
   - Wave in circular motion (universal distress signal)
   - SOS: 3 short, 3 long, 3 short flashes
   
4. **Flares:**
   - Road flares last 15-30 minutes
   - Place 50 feet from vehicle (both directions)
   - Visible 1-3 miles

## Vehicle Battery Conservation

**Why it matters:** Dead battery = no heat, no lights, no signals

**Battery drain rates:**
- **Hazard lights:** 0.5-1 amp (12-24 hours until dead)
- **Dome light:** 0.2-0.5 amp (24-48 hours)
- **Headlights:** 10-15 amps (3-6 hours)
- **Radio:** 0.5-1 amp (12-24 hours)
- **Engine running:** Charges battery (13-14 amps)

**Conservation strategies:**
1. **Run engine 10 min/hour:** Keeps battery charged
2. **Hazard lights only when help visible:** Don't run 24/7
3. **Dome light only at night:** Turn off during day
4. **NO headlights unless signaling:** Massive drain
5. **Radio off:** Unless expecting rescue communication

**Jump starting in cold:**
- Cold batteries have 50% capacity
- May need to warm battery (place inside vehicle near heater vents)
- Jumper cables often frozen (keep inside vehicle)

## Winter Survival Kit (What to Keep in Car)

**Heat retention:**
- Emergency blankets (2-3, silver mylar)
- Sleeping bag or heavy blanket
- Extra clothing (hat, gloves, socks, layers)
- Hand warmers, foot warmers (chemical)

**Signaling:**
- Bright cloth (orange, red)
- Reflective triangles
- Flashlight (LED, long battery life)
- Road flares (3-5)
- Whistle (low effort signaling)

**Food & Water:**
- High-calorie snacks (nuts, granola bars, chocolate)
- Water bottles (2-4 liters)
- Metal can for melting snow

**Tools:**
- Ice scraper, snow brush
- Small shovel (collapsible)
- Jumper cables
- Tow strap
- Multi-tool

**Safety:**
- First aid kit
- Cell phone car charger
- Matches, lighter, fire starter
- Candles (votive candles provide surprising heat in vehicle)

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Running engine continuously:** Wastes fuel, increases CO risk, battery drain
2. ❌ **Not checking exhaust:** Snow drifts can bury tailpipe in 20-30 minutes (CO poisoning)
3. ❌ **Walking away from vehicle:** 75% of deaths occur when people leave vehicle
4. ❌ **Eating snow directly:** Lowers core temp, causes hypothermia
5. ❌ **Not cracking window:** Even with clear exhaust, CO can leak from engine/exhaust system
6. ❌ **Running headlights all night:** Drains battery in 3-6 hours
7. ❌ **Ignoring CO symptoms:** Headache = CO poisoning, not "just cold"

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **Stay with vehicle:** 75% of deaths occur when people leave vehicle, rescuers find vehicles easier than people
2. ✅ **Run engine 10 min/hour:** Provides heat, charges battery, conserves fuel (6-12 hour fuel supply typical)
3. ✅ **Clear exhaust every hour:** Snow drifts can bury tailpipe in 20-30 min, CO kills faster than cold
4. ✅ **Crack window 1 inch:** Even with clear exhaust, prevents CO buildup from engine/exhaust leaks
5. ✅ **Signal aggressively:** Bright cloth on antenna, SOS in snow, flash lights when help approaches

**Most winter vehicle strandings are survivable with proper preparation and protocols. Stay, signal, stay warm.**
