# Using Vehicle as Shelter

## Overview
A vehicle can be an effective short-term shelter if you manage ventilation, insulation, and security.

## Site Selection
- Park on stable ground, away from flood channels.
- Avoid overhead hazards (dead limbs, unstable slopes).
- In cities: choose visible but low-conflict locations.

## Ventilation (Critical)
- Crack two windows slightly (crossflow) to reduce condensation and CO risk.
- Never fully seal the cabin overnight.

## Thermal Setup
- Insulate windows (reflective panels/cloth/cardboard).
- Insulate floor contact points.
- Use layered sleeping system (base + insulation + outer wind layer).

## Moisture Control
- Wipe condensation each morning.
- Dry wet clothing outside cabin when possible.
- Separate cooking from sleeping space when feasible.

## Security Protocol
- Keep keys, light, whistle, and phone within reach.
- Maintain one clear emergency exit path.
- Avoid displaying supplies from windows.

## Hygiene and Waste
- Designate toilet plan (sealed container + absorbent medium).
- Keep hand sanitation routine strict.
- Remove trash daily to reduce pests.

## Power Management
- Avoid deep-draining starter battery.
- Use engine charging in short cycles when needed.
- Prioritize critical devices only.

## Common Mistakes
- No ventilation (condensation + CO hazard).
- Sleeping in wet clothes.
- Poor site choice near runoff/flood paths.

## Summary
Vehicle shelter works best with disciplined ventilation, moisture control, and low-profile security habits.
