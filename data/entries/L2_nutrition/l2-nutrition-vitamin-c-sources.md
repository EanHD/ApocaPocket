# Vitamin C Sources & Scurvy Prevention

## Overview
Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) can appear after prolonged low intake. Prevention is straightforward with planning.

## Daily Intake Targets
- Adult men: ~90 mg/day
- Adult women: ~75 mg/day
- Smokers often need additional intake.

## Deficiency Timeline (Approximate)
- 4–8 weeks: fatigue, irritability.
- 8–12 weeks: gum bleeding, easy bruising.
- Later: poor wound healing, joint pain, tooth issues.

## High-Value Sources (Examples)
- Rose hips (very high seasonal source)
- Citrus fruits
- Bell peppers
- Brassicas (broccoli, cabbage)
- Wild greens (varies by species)

## Field Strategy
1. Build daily mixed-source intake rather than single-source dependence.
2. Favor fresh/raw where safe (heat degrades vitamin C).
3. Rotate preserved options (fermented vegetables can contribute).

## Heat/Storage Considerations
- Vitamin C is heat-sensitive and oxidation-sensitive.
- Minimize long boiling times.
- Cut produce just before use.

## Emergency Correction
If early scurvy signs appear:
- Increase intake quickly with reliable C-rich foods.
- Maintain daily replenishment for several weeks.

## Common Mistakes
- Assuming calorie sufficiency means micronutrient sufficiency.
- Overcooking all greens/vegetables.
- Relying on one seasonal source only.

## Summary
Scurvy is preventable with routine vitamin C planning, diversified sources, and low-loss preparation.
