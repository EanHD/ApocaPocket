# Food Allergies & Anaphylaxis Management

## Overview

32 million Americans have food allergies (8% of children, 10% of adults). Anaphylaxis is life-threatening but preventable.

**CRITICAL:** Anaphylaxis can kill in 15-30 minutes. Early epinephrine administration saves lives.

---

## Common Food Allergens ("Big 9")

**90% of food allergies caused by:**
1. **Milk** (most common in children)
2. **Eggs**
3. **Peanuts**
4. **Tree nuts** (almonds, walnuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios)
5. **Fish** (salmon, tuna, cod)
6. **Shellfish** (shrimp, crab, lobster)
7. **Wheat**
8. **Soy**
9. **Sesame** (recently added to "Big 8")

**Other allergens:**
- Mustard, celery, lupin (common in Europe)
- Corn, legumes (peas, beans)
- Seeds (sunflower, poppy)

---

## Anaphylaxis Recognition

**Early signs (5-30 min after exposure):**
- **Skin:** Hives, itching, flushing, swelling (lips, tongue, face)
- **Mouth:** Tingling lips, tongue swelling, metallic taste
- **Throat:** Tightness, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing
- **Respiratory:** Shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, chest tightness
- **GI:** Nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea
- **Cardiovascular:** Rapid pulse, dizziness, fainting, low blood pressure
- **Neurological:** Sense of doom, confusion

**Severe signs (life-threatening):**
- **Respiratory:** Stridor (high-pitched wheeze), severe wheezing, unable to speak, blue lips
- **Cardiovascular:** Weak pulse, rapid pulse >120, loss of consciousness, shock
- **Severe GI:** Repetitive vomiting, severe cramping

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Anaphylaxis can be biphasic (20% have second reaction 4-12 hours later). Monitor for 4-6 hours after initial reaction.

---

## EpiPen Administration (Life-Saving!)

**When to use:**
- ANY respiratory symptoms (wheezing, throat tightness, difficulty breathing)
- ANY cardiovascular symptoms (dizziness, rapid pulse, fainting)
- Multiple body systems affected (skin + GI, or skin + respiratory)
- Known severe allergy with ANY symptoms

**How to use EpiPen:**
1. **Remove from carrier tube**
2. **Form fist around injector** (orange tip DOWN, blue safety on top)
3. **Remove blue safety release** (pull straight up, don't bend)
4. **Swing and firmly push orange tip into outer thigh** (can go through clothing)
5. **Hold firmly for 3 seconds** (hear click, then feel/hear second click)
6. **Remove and massage injection site** (10 seconds)
7. **Call 911 / evacuate immediately** (epinephrine lasts only 15-20 min)
8. **Keep person lying down** (sitting/standing increases risk of cardiovascular collapse)

**Dosing:**
- **Adults/children >66 lbs:** EpiPen (0.3mg epinephrine)
- **Children 33-66 lbs:** EpiPen Jr (0.15mg epinephrine)

**Second dose:**
- If no improvement after 5-10 minutes, give second EpiPen
- Always evacuate even if improved (biphasic reaction risk)

---

## After EpiPen Use

**Expected effects:**
- **Improvement:** Breathing easier, wheezing reduced, hives fading (within 5-10 min)
- **Side effects:** Rapid heart rate, tremors, anxiety, headache (normal, temporary)

**DO NOT:**
- Assume person is "cured" (epinephrine temporary, allergy reaction continues)
- Let person sit up or stand (can trigger cardiovascular collapse, "empty ventricle syndrome")
- Delay evacuation (person needs monitoring for 4-6 hours for biphasic reaction)

**Positioning:**
- Lay flat on back with legs elevated 12 inches (shock position)
- If vomiting: turn on side but keep legs elevated
- If pregnant: tilt on left side (prevents compression of inferior vena cava)
- If respiratory distress: semi-reclined (45 degrees) BUT monitor closely for shock

---

## Antihistamines (Secondary Treatment)

**Diphenhydramine (Benadryl):**
- **Dose:** 25-50mg PO (1-2 tablets)
- **Use:** Helps with hives, itching
- **Timing:** Give AFTER epinephrine (NOT a substitute)
- **Effect:** Reduces symptoms but does NOT stop anaphylaxis

**Why antihistamines alone are NOT enough:**
- Do NOT prevent cardiovascular collapse
- Do NOT open airways (no bronchodilation)
- Work too slowly (20-30 min vs EpiPen 5 min)
- Can cause drowsiness (masks worsening symptoms)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Antihistamines are NOT a substitute for epinephrine. Use both, but epinephrine first.

---

## Cross-Contamination Risks

**How cross-contamination occurs:**
- Shared utensils (knife, cutting board)
- Shared cooking surfaces (grill, pan)
- Shared fryer oil (French fries cooked in same oil as fish)
- Airborne particles (flour dust, nut dust)
- Hand contact (touching allergen, then other food)

**High-risk scenarios:**
- Buffets (serving spoons mixed between dishes)
- Shared condiments (peanut butter knife in jam)
- Bakeries (wheat flour in air, equipment)
- Ice cream shops (scoops contaminated between flavors)

**Prevention:**
- Dedicated allergen-free prep area
- Separate cutting boards, utensils (color-coded)
- Clean surfaces with soap and water (not just wiping)
- Wash hands thoroughly
- Change gloves between foods
- Label allergen-free foods clearly

---

## Label Reading

**FDA labeling rules:**
- "Big 9" allergens must be declared if present
- Listed in ingredients OR "Contains" statement
- Precautionary statements ("may contain") are voluntary, not regulated

**Hidden allergens:**

| Allergen | Hidden Sources |
|----------|---------------|
| **Milk** | Casein, whey, lactose, curds, ghee |
| **Egg** | Albumin, lysozyme, lecithin (sometimes), mayonnaise |
| **Wheat** | Semolina, durum, kamut, spelt, triticale |
| **Soy** | Lecithin (usually), tofu, miso, tempeh, edamame |
| **Peanut** | Groundnuts, beer nuts, monkey nuts |
| **Tree nuts** | Marzipan, nougat, gianduja, pesto |

**Precautionary statements:**
- "May contain [allergen]"
- "Processed in a facility that also processes [allergen]"
- "Manufactured on equipment shared with [allergen]"

**⚠️ RULE:** If you have severe allergy, avoid precautionary statement foods.

## Food Allergy vs Food Intolerance

| Feature | Allergy | Intolerance |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Mechanism** | Immune system (IgE antibodies) | Digestive system |
| **Onset** | Rapid (5-30 min) | Delayed (30 min - 48 hours) |
| **Amount** | Tiny amount can trigger | Usually dose-dependent |
| **Severity** | Can be life-threatening | Uncomfortable but not fatal |
| **Symptoms** | Hives, swelling, breathing difficulty | Bloating, diarrhea, cramps |
| **Treatment** | EpiPen, antihistamines | Avoidance, enzyme supplements |

**Common intolerances:**
- Lactose intolerance (milk sugar, NOT an allergy)
- Gluten sensitivity (NOT celiac disease, NOT an allergy)
- FODMAP sensitivity (fermentable carbs)

---

## Emergency Without EpiPen

**If no EpiPen available (VERY RISKY):**
1. **Antihistamine:** Benadryl 50mg immediately (helps but NOT sufficient)
2. **Inhaler:** Albuterol (if wheezing present, helps bronchodilation)
3. **Positioning:** Lay flat, elevate legs (prevents cardiovascular collapse)
4. **Oxygen:** If available (any source)
5. **EVACUATE URGENTLY:** Person needs epinephrine and monitoring

**⚠️ WARNING:** Anaphylaxis without epinephrine has 1-3% mortality. Evacuation is critical.

---

## Prevention Strategies

**At home:**
- Read labels every time (manufacturers change recipes)
- Cook at home (more control over ingredients)
- Keep EpiPen accessible (not locked in medicine cabinet)
- Check expiration dates (EpiPen expires after 18-24 months)
- Replace EpiPen if solution is discolored or cloudy

**Eating out:**
- Inform staff of allergy (speak to manager, not just server)
- Avoid high-risk foods (sauces, fried foods, desserts)
- Carry chef cards (printed allergy info in multiple languages)
- Avoid buffets, bakeries, ice cream shops (high cross-contamination)

**Travel:**
- Pack extra EpiPens (1 in bag, 1 in carry-on)
- Research hospitals at destination
- Learn allergy phrases in local language
- Avoid street food (ingredients unclear)

---

## Testing New Foods (Field Setting)

**Universal edibility test does NOT apply to known food allergies.**

**If testing new wild food with allergy history:**
1. **DO NOT test if severe allergy** (peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, etc.)
2. **If mild allergy to different food:** Start with skin test (rub on inner forearm, wait 15 min)
3. **If no reaction:** Touch to lips, wait 15 min
4. **If no reaction:** Small amount on tongue, wait 15 min
5. **If no reaction:** Chew and spit out, wait 15 min
6. **If no reaction:** Small amount swallowed, wait 4-6 hours

**⚠️ DO NOT attempt if:**
- History of anaphylaxis to ANY food
- No EpiPen available
- Alone (needs someone to administer EpiPen if reaction)

---

## EpiPen Expiration & Storage

**Storage:**
- Room temperature (59-86°F / 15-30°C)
- Protect from light (keep in carrier tube)
- Do NOT refrigerate (causes condensation, clogs needle)
- Do NOT freeze (destroys epinephrine)
- Avoid extreme heat (>95°F degrades epinephrine)

**Expiration:**
- Check expiration date monthly
- Replace before expiration (effectiveness drops off)
- If expired: Better to use expired EpiPen than none (may still have 70-80% potency)

**Visual check:**
- Look through window in carrier tube
- Solution should be clear and colorless
- If brown, cloudy, or contains particles: REPLACE
