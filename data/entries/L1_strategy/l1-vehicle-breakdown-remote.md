# Vehicle Breakdown in Remote Area

## Overview
Stay with the vehicle unless there is **known, nearby, safe shelter**. A vehicle is easier for rescuers to spot than a person.

## First 10 Minutes (STOP Protocol)
1. **S**ecure scene (off road, hazards on if battery allows).
2. **T**ake inventory (fuel, water, food, clothing, tools, battery, phone signal).
3. **O**rient and assess (weather, daylight left, distance to known help).
4. **P**lan and commit (avoid changing plans repeatedly).

## Stay vs Go Decision Matrix
- **Stay** if: unknown distance to help, bad weather, night, injury, weak group member.
- **Go** only if: help is confirmed within ~1 mile (1.6 km), weather stable, route obvious, you can return.

## Immediate Vehicle Checks
- Flat tire: replace if safe and tools available.
- Battery: check terminals, try jump-start.
- Overheating: wait 30–60 min before opening cap.
- Fuel leak: do not run engine; move away from vapors.

## Water and Food Rationing
- Target hydration in heat: **2–4 L/day** per adult minimum.
- Cold weather: **2–3 L/day** still required.
- Eat small frequent portions; avoid high-salt meals if water is limited.

## Signaling Priorities
1. Bright cloth on antenna/mirror.
2. Large ground signal: SOS or X (letters >3 m / 10 ft).
3. Mirror flashes in daylight.
4. Light signals at night (conserve battery).

## Safety Risks
- Heat stroke: shade, reduce activity midday.
- Hypothermia: insulate from ground, layer clothing.
- CO poisoning: never sleep with running engine in enclosed/snow-blocked exhaust conditions.

## Evacuation Criteria
Evacuate immediately if:
- Medical emergency (chest pain, severe bleeding, altered mental status).
- Active wildfire/flood/landslide threat.
- Vehicle unsafe (fire/fuel leak) and no way to mitigate.

## Common Mistakes
- Leaving vehicle without a clear destination.
- Wasting battery by running hazards continuously.
- Overexerting in daytime heat.
- Underestimating dehydration.

## Summary
Vehicle = shelter + signal platform + supply cache. Preserve energy, signal consistently, and avoid unnecessary movement.
