# Subway & Tunnel Survival

## Overview
Underground spaces amplify risk: darkness, smoke, flooding, electricity, panic movement.

## Immediate Hazards
- **Third rail/electrified systems**: treat tracks and adjacent hardware as live.
- **Floodwater**: may rise rapidly and hide hazards.
- **Smoke**: toxic gases accumulate quickly.

## If Train Stops in Tunnel
1. Stay calm and await operator instructions if no immediate hazard.
2. If evacuation ordered, move as directed on service walkway.
3. Keep one hand on wall/rail in low visibility.

## Fire/Smoke Protocol
- Move **upwind/up-tunnel** away from smoke source.
- Stay low (cleaner air near floor).
- Cover nose/mouth with damp cloth if possible.
- Prioritize nearest marked emergency exit.

## Flooding Protocol
- Move to higher elevation immediately (platform stairs/service exits).
- Do not enter moving water in tunnels.
- Avoid touching rails, cables, metal structures in water.

## Crowd Survival
- Avoid center compression in panic flows.
- Angle toward edges and structural openings.
- Keep hands in front of chest to protect breathing space.

## Minimal Carry Kit for Underground
- Headlamp + backup light
- N95 mask
- Whistle
- Compact map/photo of station exits

## Evacuation Criteria
Leave immediately for:
- Visible smoke/flame
- Rising water
- Electrical arcing/sparking
- Structural cracking/falling debris

## Common Mistakes
- Jumping to tracks without necessity.
- Moving against dense crowd flow head-on.
- Ignoring ventilation direction.

## Summary
Underground survival = avoid electrical contact, escape smoke/flood early, and move deliberately via known exits.
