summary: Working native copper and smelting copper ore for tools, vessels, and eventually
  bronze alloys.
steps:
- Find native copper nuggets in streambeds or green-stained rocks (malachite, azurite)
  for ore.
- Cold-work native copper by hammering; anneal (heat to red and quench) to restore
  malleability.
- Smelt copper ore in a charcoal furnace with bellows at ~1100°C.
- Cast copper into molds for axes, vessels, and fittings.
- Alloy with tin (5-12%) to create bronze—harder and better for tools.
warnings:
- Copper smelting produces toxic fumes—smelt only outdoors.
- Molten copper splashes violently if it contacts moisture.

## Overview
Working native copper and smelting copper ore for tools, vessels, and eventually bronze alloys.

## Step-by-step
1. Find native copper nuggets in streambeds or green-stained rocks (malachite, azurite) for ore.
2. Cold-work native copper by hammering; anneal (heat to red and quench) to restore malleability.
3. Smelt copper ore in a charcoal furnace with bellows at ~1100°C.
4. Cast copper into molds for axes, vessels, and fittings.
5. Alloy with tin (5-12%) to create bronze—harder and better for tools.

## Warnings
- Copper smelting produces toxic fumes—smelt only outdoors.
- Molten copper splashes violently if it contacts moisture.
