summary: 'Your body can be fine while your mind collapses. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, grief, and hopelessness kill survivors. This entry covers: recognizing mental health crises, self-care practices, group
  support, and creating meaning in survival. Survival is not just physical — it''s existential.'
warnings:
- Suicide risk is real in prolonged survival situations, especially after traumatic loss
- Substance abuse (alcohol, drugs if available) becomes a coping mechanism and spirals into addiction
- Psychosis can develop from isolation, sleep deprivation, or extreme stress — recognize and respond
- Mental health decline is contagious in groups — one person's despair can spread
steps:
- 'RECOGNIZING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS: DEPRESSION: loss of interest in activities, sleeping too much or too little, apathy, comments about being a burden, neglecting hygiene, giving away possessions. ANXIETY:
  hypervigilance, insomnia, panic attacks (rapid breathing, chest pain, feeling of dying), constant worry, avoidance behaviors. PTSD: flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness, startle response, avoidance
  of trauma reminders. PSYCHOSIS: hearing/seeing things others don''t, paranoid beliefs, disorganized thoughts, self-harm. SUICIDE RISK: talking about death, saying goodbye, reckless behavior, sudden calm
  after period of depression.'
- 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO SUICIDE RISK: (1) Do not leave the person alone. (2) Remove means (weapons, rope, medications). (3) Ask directly: ''Are you thinking about killing yourself?'' Being direct does
  NOT plant the idea. (4) Listen without judgment. (5) Create a safety plan (''I will tell you if I feel this way again. I will not act on these thoughts for 24 hours.''). (6) Involve others (trusted group
  members). (7) Increase supervision and support.'
- 'DAILY MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICES (individual): (1) Routine = predictability = reduced anxiety. Same wake time, meals, tasks, bedtime. (2) Physical activity (daily). Endorphins help. (3) Sunlight exposure
  (vitamin D, circadian rhythm). (4) Sleep hygiene (dark, quiet, consistent schedule). (5) Social connection (talk to others, even small talk). (6) Purpose (set daily goals, contribute to group, help others).
  (7) Gratitude practice (name 3 things you''re grateful for each day — even tiny things). (8) Limit rumination (when spiraling, change activity — move, sing, work with hands).'
- 'GRIEF PROCESSING: Loss is inevitable (people, pets, old life, identity, hopes). STAGES (not linear): denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. Allow yourself to feel. RITUALS help: burials,
  memorial services, storytelling about the deceased, keeping mementos. Set aside time to grieve (don''t suppress it), then return to daily tasks. Time does not heal all wounds, but it makes them bearable.'
- 'ISOLATION (solo survival): Loneliness is physiologically painful. COPING: (1) Talk out loud (to yourself, imaginary friend, pet, inanimate objects). (2) Journal (writing is communication with future
  self). (3) Create anthropomorphized companions (Wilson the volleyball is real). (4) Sing, hum, whistle (sound is comforting). (5) Set goals (gives structure). (6) If you encounter other humans, approach
  cautiously but consider joining (humans are social animals).'
- 'GROUP MENTAL HEALTH: (1) Check-ins: daily or weekly group discussion about how people are feeling. (2) Shared burden: rotate hard tasks, help each other. (3) Celebrate: birthdays, holidays (even improvised),
  successful hunts, completed projects. (4) Cultural activities: music, storytelling, games, dance. These are NOT luxuries — they''re survival. (5) Conflict resolution: address problems early before they
  fester. (6) Shared meaning: create a group identity, values, rituals.'
- 'TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE: After traumatic events (death, violence, disaster), expect: nightmares, flashbacks, numbness, irritability, withdrawal. DO: (1) Normalize these reactions (''What you''re feeling
  is a normal response to abnormal events''). (2) Maintain routine. (3) Allow people to talk if they want, but don''t force. (4) Physical safety and meeting basic needs first. (5) Reconnect people with
  support systems. DON''T: (1) Force immediate ''talking it through'' (can re-traumatize). (2) Say ''I know how you feel'' (you don''t). (3) Minimize their experience (''Others have it worse'').'
- 'CREATING MEANING: Viktor Frankl (Holocaust survivor) wrote ''Man''s Search for Meaning'' — humans can endure almost anything if they have a WHY. In survival: your WHY might be: protecting others, rebuilding
  civilization, preserving knowledge, honoring those you lost, or simply ''I refuse to let this break me.'' Find your why and return to it when motivation fades.'
- 'WHEN TO SEEK HELP (if civilization still exists): Suicidal ideation lasting >2 weeks, psychosis, violence toward self/others, complete inability to function for >1 month. If help is unavailable: increase
  supervision, involve trusted group members, remove means of self-harm, focus on tiny goals (survive today, survive this hour).'
