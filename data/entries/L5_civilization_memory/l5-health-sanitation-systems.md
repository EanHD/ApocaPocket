summary: Designing and building sanitation systems to prevent disease from human waste.
steps:
- Site latrines 30+ meters from water sources and downhill from wells.
- Dig pit latrines at least 2 meters deep with stable, lined walls.
- Build a slab cover with a hole and a lid to reduce flies and odor.
- Add ash, lime, or soil after each use to accelerate decomposition.
- When pits are 0.5m from full, cap with soil and dig a new pit.
warnings:
- 'Fecal contamination of water is the #1 killer in post-collapse scenarios.'
- Never use fresh human waste as fertilizer—compost for 1+ year first.

## Overview
Designing and building sanitation systems to prevent disease from human waste.

## Step-by-step
1. Site latrines 30+ meters from water sources and downhill from wells.
2. Dig pit latrines at least 2 meters deep with stable, lined walls.
3. Build a slab cover with a hole and a lid to reduce flies and odor.
4. Add ash, lime, or soil after each use to accelerate decomposition.
5. When pits are 0.5m from full, cap with soil and dig a new pit.

## Warnings
- Fecal contamination of water is the #1 killer in post-collapse scenarios.
- Never use fresh human waste as fertilizer—compost for 1+ year first.
