summary: Choosing and building appropriate foundations based on soil conditions and
  structure type.
steps:
- 'Assess soil: dig test pits to check bearing capacity—clay, sand, rock, or fill.'
- 'Use spread footings for walls: widen the base to distribute load over soft soil.'
- Use pier/post foundations on slopes or in wet areas to elevate the structure.
- Build slab-on-grade for simple structures on stable, level ground.
- Ensure foundations extend below frost line to prevent heaving.
warnings:
- Poor foundations cause total structural failure—never skip soil assessment.
- Wet or expansive clay soils require special drainage and wider footings.

## Overview
Choosing and building appropriate foundations based on soil conditions and structure type.

## Step-by-step
1. Assess soil: dig test pits to check bearing capacity—clay, sand, rock, or fill.
2. Use spread footings for walls: widen the base to distribute load over soft soil.
3. Use pier/post foundations on slopes or in wet areas to elevate the structure.
4. Build slab-on-grade for simple structures on stable, level ground.
5. Ensure foundations extend below frost line to prevent heaving.

## Warnings
- Poor foundations cause total structural failure—never skip soil assessment.
- Wet or expansive clay soils require special drainage and wider footings.
