## Overview
Applying systematic observation and experimentation to solve problems and improve techniques.

## Step-by-step
1. Observe a phenomenon or problem carefully; record detailed notes.
2. Form a hypothesis: a testable explanation for what you observed.
3. Design a simple experiment: change one variable, keep others constant.
4. Record results honestly, including failures and unexpected outcomes.
5. Share findings with the community; repeat experiments to verify.

## Warnings
- Confirmation bias: don't ignore results that contradict your hypothesis.
- Anecdotes are not evidence—require repeatable results.
