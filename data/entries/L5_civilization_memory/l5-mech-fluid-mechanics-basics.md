summary: Principles of fluid flow for designing water systems, hydraulic presses,
  and simple pumps.
steps:
- Understand pressure = force / area and how it transmits through fluids (Pascal's
  principle).
- 'Calculate flow rate: cross-sectional area × velocity.'
- 'Apply gravity-fed systems: 1 meter of head ≈ 9.8 kPa (1.42 psi) pressure.'
- 'Build simple pumps: piston pump, rope pump, or ram pump for water lifting.'
- Minimize friction losses with smooth, large-diameter pipes and few bends.
warnings:
- Water hammer from sudden valve closure can burst pipes.
- Ensure intake screens to prevent debris from jamming pumps.

## Overview
Principles of fluid flow for designing water systems, hydraulic presses, and simple pumps.

## Step-by-step
1. Understand pressure = force / area and how it transmits through fluids (Pascal's principle).
2. Calculate flow rate: cross-sectional area × velocity.
3. Apply gravity-fed systems: 1 meter of head ≈ 9.8 kPa (1.42 psi) pressure.
4. Build simple pumps: piston pump, rope pump, or ram pump for water lifting.
5. Minimize friction losses with smooth, large-diameter pipes and few bends.

## Warnings
- Water hammer from sudden valve closure can burst pipes.
- Ensure intake screens to prevent debris from jamming pumps.
