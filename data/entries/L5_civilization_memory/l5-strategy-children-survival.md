summary: 'Children change everything. They can''t forage, can''t work long hours, need more food per body weight, and are more vulnerable to exposure. But they''re also the future. This entry covers: keeping
  kids safe, age-appropriate tasks, education in survival, and psychological needs.'
warnings:
- Infants (0-2) are high-risk in survival situations — they cannot regulate temperature, communicate needs clearly, or contribute to survival
- Children dehydrate faster than adults and are more susceptible to hypothermia — monitor constantly
- Boredom and fear create behavioral problems that endanger the group — keep children engaged
- Trauma affects children differently than adults — they may regress, become silent, or act out
steps:
- 'INFANTS (0-2 years): CHALLENGES: Total dependence, cannot walk, regulate temperature poorly, need frequent feeding, loud crying can compromise safety. CARE: Skin-to-skin contact for warmth. Breastfeeding
  if possible (requires mother to eat enough — priority nutrition). If bottle-fed: water purification critical. Diapers: cloth rags, cleaned daily (or moss, grass — changed frequently). Carry in a sling
  (keeps hands free). Shelter: infant sleeps between two adults for warmth. RISKS: Dehydration (check soft spot on head — sunken = dehydrated), hypothermia, choking on small objects. TASKS: None. Infants
  are pure resource consumers but future members.'
- 'TODDLERS (2-5 years): CHALLENGES: Mobile but clumsy (injury risk), curious (poisoning/burning risk), short attention span, limited understanding of danger. CARE: Constant supervision. Teach basic rules
  (don''t wander, don''t touch fire, stay close). Simple clothing (easy to remove for bathroom, layer for warmth). TASKS: Tiny contributions (gathering sticks, collecting berries in a container, carrying
  small items). More about habit formation than productivity. Make it a game. EDUCATION: Teach plant identification (''this is safe, this is dangerous''), animal awareness, basic safety. PSYCHOLOGICAL:
  Routine is critical. Same bedtime, same tasks. Reduces anxiety.'
- 'CHILDREN (6-12 years): CHALLENGES: High energy (need MORE food per pound than adults, active growth), accidents (cuts, burns, falls), social needs (need play and peers). CARE: Teach self-care (dressing,
  hygiene, minor first aid). TASKS: Real contributions — gathering firewood, hauling water (sized for their strength), weeding gardens, simple food prep, fishing (with supervision), helping with younger
  children. Assign daily chores. Rotate tasks to teach variety. EDUCATION: Critical window. Teach reading, writing, math, science, history, survival skills. 2-3 hours daily formal learning + hands-on skills
  training. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Play is essential. Create games, toys from natural materials, tell stories, sing songs. Peer interaction if possible.'
- 'ADOLESCENTS (13-18 years): CHALLENGES: Physical strength approaching adults but judgment still developing. Risk-taking behavior. Identity formation (conflict with authority). Hormones (moodiness, attraction,
  social dynamics). CARE: Transition to adult responsibilities. TASKS: Full work contributions — hunting, building, heavy labor, teaching younger children, taking watch shifts. Can be trusted with complex
  tasks. EDUCATION: Advanced skills (metalworking, advanced medical, planning, leadership). Apprenticeship model — pair with skilled adult. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Give them responsibility and autonomy (within limits).
  Involve in group decisions. Provide purpose (you''re important to the group''s survival). Address romance/sexuality directly (in group settings, it will happen).'
- 'SAFETY PROTOCOLS: (1) Buddy system — never let children wander alone. (2) Establish camp boundaries (marked with sticks/rocks). Outside = adult supervision required. (3) Teach three whistle blasts =
  I need help. (4) Designate a ''safe spot'' at camp where children go during emergencies. (5) Regular head counts throughout the day. (6) Keep hazards (tools, fire, medicines, poisons) secured or high/out
  of reach.'
- 'EDUCATION IN SURVIVAL: Even if you''re struggling, teach for 1 hour daily minimum. Literacy dies in one generation if not taught. Use: charcoal on bark for writing, dirt/snow for math drawings, storytelling
  for history/science, hands-on for skills. Teaching also gives YOU purpose and routine.'
- 'PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT: Children need explanations appropriate to their age. Don''t lie (they sense it and trust breaks). Acknowledge fear (''Yes, this is scary, but we have a plan''). Celebrate small
  wins. Create normalcy (bedtime stories, holidays, birthdays). Let them be kids when possible. Trauma support: allow emotional expression, maintain physical affection (if appropriate), avoid forcing them
  to talk but listen when they do.'
- 'LONE PARENT WITH CHILDREN: Exhaustion is your biggest enemy. Sleep when they sleep. Prioritize safety over progress. Involve older children in caring for younger. Create a tight routine that runs itself.
  Ask for help if others are present (raising children is community work). YOU must stay healthy — if you collapse, they all die.'

# Children in Survival Situations — Ages 0-18

Children change everything. They can't forage, can't work long hours, need more food per body weight, and are more vulnerable to exposure. But they're also the future. This entry covers: keeping kids safe, age-appropriate tasks, education in survival, and psychological needs.
