steps:
- 'Learn standard radio protocols: call signs, phonetic alphabet, brevity codes.'
- 'Understand frequency bands: HF (3-30 MHz) for long range, VHF/UHF for local.'
- Establish scheduled contact times (skeds) to conserve battery power.
- 'Build simple antennas: dipole for HF, ground-plane for VHF.'
- 'Maintain equipment: protect from moisture, check connections, conserve batteries.'
warnings:
- Radio transmissions reveal your location—use sparingly in hostile situations.
- Atmospheric conditions affect HF propagation—have backup communication plans.

## Overview
Operating and maintaining radio equipment for reliable long-distance electronic communication.

## Step-by-step
1. Learn standard radio protocols: call signs, phonetic alphabet, brevity codes.
2. Understand frequency bands: HF (3-30 MHz) for long range, VHF/UHF for local.
3. Establish scheduled contact times (skeds) to conserve battery power.
4. Build simple antennas: dipole for HF, ground-plane for VHF.
5. Maintain equipment: protect from moisture, check connections, conserve batteries.

## Warnings
- Radio transmissions reveal your location—use sparingly in hostile situations.
- Atmospheric conditions affect HF propagation—have backup communication plans.
