summary: Using flags, mirrors, smoke, horns, and drums for long-distance communication
  without electronics.
steps:
- Establish a shared signal code (e.g., flag positions, drum patterns).
- Use mirror signals (heliograph) for daytime line-of-sight communication up to 50+
  km.
- Use smoke signals with wet fuel for visible plumes; pre-agreed patterns.
- 'Sound signals: horns, bells, drums carry 1-5 km depending on terrain.'
- Set up relay stations on hilltops for extended range communication chains.
warnings:
- Signals are visible to everyone—assume hostile observers.
- Weather (fog, wind) degrades both visual and audio signals.

## Overview
Using flags, mirrors, smoke, horns, and drums for long-distance communication without electronics.

## Step-by-step
1. Establish a shared signal code (e.g., flag positions, drum patterns).
2. Use mirror signals (heliograph) for daytime line-of-sight communication up to 50+ km.
3. Use smoke signals with wet fuel for visible plumes; pre-agreed patterns.
4. Sound signals: horns, bells, drums carry 1-5 km depending on terrain.
5. Set up relay stations on hilltops for extended range communication chains.

## Warnings
- Signals are visible to everyone—assume hostile observers.
- Weather (fog, wind) degrades both visual and audio signals.
