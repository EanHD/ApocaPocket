# Bloomery Iron Smelting
**Level 5: Metallurgy & Manufacturing**

## Why This Matters
Iron smelting is **THE TECHNOLOGY THAT DEFINED CIVILIZATION** for 3,000+ years. Iron tools unlocked:
- **Agriculture**: Iron plows → 10× farming efficiency → food surplus → population growth
- **Construction**: Nails, hinges, tools, saws → buildings, infrastructure
- **Manufacturing**: Axes, chisels, drills → woodworking, metalworking
- **Warfare**: Swords, armor, arrows → security, expansion

**Bronze vs Iron comparison**:
- Bronze: Rare (requires copper + tin, not abundant), 500 HV hardness
- Iron: **Abundant** (4th most common element in Earth's crust), 800+ HV hardness when carburized to steel

**One bloomery operator can produce 50-100 lbs of iron per week** → supplies an entire village with tools that last years. **This is civilization's most important multiplier technology.**

## Iron Ore Identification

### What Is Iron Ore?
**Iron oxide minerals** (iron + oxygen, must be separated by smelting):

| Ore Type | Formula | Iron Content | Appearance | Location |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Hematite** | Fe₂O₃ | 70% | Red/brown, heavy, rust-like | Most common, widespread |
| **Magnetite** | Fe₃O₄ | 72% | Black, magnetic | Volcanic areas, riverbeds |
| **Limonite** | FeO(OH) | 60% | Yellow-brown, earthy | Swamps, bogs (bog iron) |
| **Siderite** | FeCO₃ | 48% | Gray-brown, crystalline | Sedimentary deposits |

### Field Tests

**1. Color test**:
- Red/brown staining on rocks → likely hematite
- Black, metallic luster → magnetite
- Yellow/orange crust → limonite (bog iron)

**2. Streak test**:
- Scrape rock on concrete/stone
- **Red-brown streak** = hematite (best indicator)
- Black streak = magnetite
- Yellow-brown = limonite

**3. Magnet test**:
- **Magnetite**: Strongly magnetic (attracts magnet/compass needle)
- Hematite/limonite: Weakly magnetic or not magnetic

**4. Heft test**:
- Iron ore is **HEAVY** (2-3× heavier than normal rock)
- If it looks like rock but feels like metal → probably iron ore

**5. Roasting test** (destructive):
- Heat small piece in fire 30 minutes
- If it becomes magnetic → contains iron

### Best Locations
- **Riverbeds**: Heavy iron ore settles (placer deposits)
- **Outcrops**: Exposed red/brown rock layers (sedimentary iron)
- **Bogs/swamps**: "Bog iron" (limonite) in shallow water/mud
- **Volcanic areas**: Magnetite in black sand
- **Hillsides**: Weathered iron-rich layers

**Historical note**: Many early civilizations used **bog iron** (easy to collect, no mining needed)

## Ore Preparation

### 1. Crushing
**Purpose**: Increase surface area (speeds reaction with carbon)

**Method**:
- Break large chunks with hammer/sledge
- Grind to pea-sized pieces (1/4 to 1/2 inch)
- Too fine = blocks airflow
- Too coarse = incomplete reduction

**Tools**: Hammer, grinding stone, mortar & pestle (for small batches)

### 2. Roasting (Optional but Recommended)
**Purpose**: 
- Remove moisture (prevents steam explosions)
- Convert carbonates/hydroxides to oxides (easier reduction)
- Pre-heat ore (saves fuel during smelt)

**Method**:
1. Spread ore in shallow layer (2-3 inches)
2. Heat in fire or kiln to red-hot (1200-1500°F)
3. Hold temperature 1-2 hours
4. Let cool naturally
5. **Result**: Ore is reddish, lighter (water driven off)

### 3. Flux (Optional for High-Silica Ores)
**Purpose**: Flux combines with silica (sand) in ore → liquid slag (separates from iron)

**Materials**:
- **Limestone** (calcium carbonate): Most common flux
- **Crushed shells**: Alternative source of calcium
- **Ratio**: 5-10% of ore weight

## Bloomery Furnace Construction

### What Is a Bloomery?
**Low-shaft furnace** (3-4 feet tall) that produces **spongy iron "bloom"** (not molten—iron's melting point is 2800°F, unattainable with charcoal/air blast). Carbon from charcoal reduces iron oxide to metallic iron.

### Materials

**Furnace body**:
- **Clay** (50%) + **Sand** (50%) → refractory mix (fire-resistant)
- Alternative: **Fire bricks** (if available)
- **Straw/grass**: Mixed into clay for insulation, prevents cracking

**Structure**:
- **Stone base**: Foundation (raises furnace, aids drainage)
- **Slag tap hole**: Bottom opening (molten slag drains out)
- **Tuyere (air inlet)**: Pipe/tube for bellows (8-12 inches above base)
- **Chimney/top**: Open top (gases escape, ore/fuel loaded)

### Dimensions (Small Bloomery)

**Height**: 3-4 feet (shaft height)
**Internal diameter**: 10-14 inches (smaller = hotter, larger = more capacity)
**Wall thickness**: 4-6 inches (insulation, structural strength)
**Tuyere height**: 8-12 inches above base (optimal airflow)

### Construction Steps

1. **Foundation**:
   - Dig pit or build stone platform (level, stable)
   - Create slag run-off channel (shallow trench)

2. **Build walls**:
   - **Option A** (Clay): Form clay-sand mixture around mold (barrel, logs)
     - Dry slowly over 1-2 weeks (crack = failure)
     - Fire empty furnace gently to harden clay
   - **Option B** (Brick): Stack fire bricks with clay mortar
     - Circular interior, square exterior

3. **Tuyere installation**:
   - Insert pipe (clay, stone, or iron) through wall at 45° downward angle
   - Pipe diameter: 1-2 inches (connects to bellows)
   - Seal around pipe with clay (airtight except through pipe)

4. **Slag tap**:
   - Arch-shaped opening at base (4-6 inches wide, 3-4 inches tall)
   - Plug with clay before smelting (breaks through when slag ready)

5. **Curing**:
   - Dry furnace 1-2 weeks (cracks = rebuild)
   - Fire gently with wood for 2-4 hours (first use)
   - Let cool, inspect for cracks, repair with clay

## Bellows (Air Supply) — CRITICAL

**Why necessary**: Charcoal needs **forced air** to reach 2300-2500°F (temperature required for iron reduction)

### Bellows Types

**1. Box bellows** (easiest):
- Two wooden boards hinged at one end
- Leather sides (flexible, airtight)
- One-way valves (flap of leather): Air in when opening, air out through nozzle when closing
- **Size**: 2 ft × 3 ft boards → adequate airflow

**2. Double-action bellows**:
- Two chambers alternate (continuous airflow)
- More efficient, consistent blast

**3. Mechanical blowers** (if available):
- Hand-crank fan, electric blower (modern)
- Adjust with damper (avoid too much air = oxidizes iron)

### Airflow Rate
**Target**: 20-40 CFM (cubic feet per minute) continuous
- Too little: Temperature drops, smelt fails
- Too much: Oxidizes iron (burns away), waste fuel

**Test**: Bellows should keep charcoal **glowing white-hot** at tuyere

## Smelting Process

### Materials Needed (Per Smelt)

**For 10 lbs of iron output**:
- **Iron ore**: 20 lbs (50% yield typical)
- **Charcoal**: 60 lbs (3:1 charcoal:ore ratio)
- **Flux** (optional): 2 lbs limestone
- **Time**: 8-12 hours
- **Labor**: 2 people (1 bellows operator, 1 furnace tender)

### Step-by-Step

**1. Pre-heat furnace** (1-2 hours):
- Fill with charcoal
- Light fire at tuyere
- Blow bellows continuously
- **Goal**: Entire furnace glowing red-hot, stable temperature

**2. Begin charging** (layering):
- **Layer 1**: Charcoal (fill to tuyere level)
- **Layer 2**: Ore (handful, ~2 lbs)
- **Layer 3**: Charcoal (cover ore)
- **Repeat layers** every 15-20 minutes
- **Maintain charcoal level** at top (never let it drop below halfway)

**3. Slag formation** (2-4 hours in):
- Molten slag (liquid rock, iron impurities) forms at bottom
- **Color**: Orange-red, glassy, flows like honey
- **Test**: Poke iron rod into slag tap hole—if flows easily, ready to drain

**4. Tap slag**:
- Break clay plug at slag tap hole (use iron rod)
- Slag flows into collection channel/pit (avoid water—steam explosion)
- **DO NOT drain completely** (small slag pool protects bloom)
- Re-plug hole with clay if multiple taps needed

**5. Bloom formation** (6-10 hours total):
- **Bloom grows** at furnace bottom (above slag pool)
- Spongy iron mass + slag + unburned charcoal
- **Signs bloom is ready**:
  - Furnace sounds "dead" (less vigorous burning)
  - Less slag production
  - Steady charcoal consumption

**6. Extraction**:
- **Stop bellows**, let temperature drop slightly (1-2 hours)
- **Break open furnace** (if single-use) or extract through top (if reusable design)
- **Pull bloom**: Use iron tongs/hooks
  - Bloom is red-hot (1800-2000°F), **glowing**
  - **EXTREME BURN HAZARD**

**7. Initial consolidation**:
- Place bloom on anvil or flat stone
- **Hammer while hot** (squeeze out slag, compact iron)
- Bloom will spark, slag will ooze out
- Reheat in forge as needed (stays workable longer)

---

## Bloom Processing (To Usable Iron)

### Step 1: Remove Slag
- Heat bloom to yellow-hot (2000°F+) in forge
- Hammer vigorously (flatten, fold, hammer again)
- Slag squeezes out (looks like orange glass)
- **Repeat 5-10 times** (each heat cycle removes more slag)

### Step 2: Consolidate
- Fold and weld bloom into solid bar
- **Process**: Heat → hammer flat → fold over → hammer → repeat
- Carbon from charcoal enters iron surface → **steel forms** (hardened layer)

### Step 3: Shape
- Forge into bars, rods, or rough tool shapes
- Store for later use or forge into tools immediately

**Yield**: 
- Start: 10 lbs bloom (50% iron, 50% slag/impurities)
- Finish: 5-7 lbs wrought iron bar

## Safety (EXTREME HAZARDS)

### Molten Slag
⚠️ **Slag is 1800-2000°F liquid rock** → severe burns, melts clothing/skin
- Wear: Leather apron, gloves, boots, eye protection
- Clear area around slag tap (no flammables)
- **NEVER add water to slag** → violent steam explosion

### Carbon Monoxide
⚠️ **CO is odorless, lethal** (produced during smelting)
- Operate outdoors or with excellent ventilation
- Avoid leaning over furnace (CO concentrates at top)
- Symptoms: Headache, dizziness, nausea → move to fresh air immediately

### Furnace Failure
⚠️ **Furnace collapse = molten material dump**
- Inspect walls before each smelt (cracks = danger)
- Keep bystanders 10+ feet away
- Have sand nearby (smother fire/contain spills—NOT water)

### Hot Bloom Extraction
⚠️ **Bloom is 1800-2000°F when extracted** (invisible heat after stops glowing red)
- Use long tongs (3+ feet)
- Thick leather gloves (welding gloves ideal)
- Clear area (drop = fire hazard)

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Bloom doesn't form | Temperature too low | More airflow, better charcoal, preheat longer |
| Iron oxidizes (burns) | Too much air | Reduce bellows blast, layer ore deeper |
| Furnace won't stay hot | Insufficient charcoal | Maintain charcoal level, use hardwood charcoal |
| Slag won't flow | Too viscous (needs flux) | Add limestone (5-10%), higher temperature |
| Bloom is tiny/no iron | Ore not reduced | Longer smelt time, hotter temperature, more charcoal |
| Furnace cracks | Thermal shock, wet clay | Dry thoroughly, preheat slowly, add straw to clay |

## Civilization Unlock: The Iron Age

**Before iron** (Bronze Age, 3000-1200 BCE):
- Tools: Bronze (rare, expensive)
- Agriculture: Wooden/stone plows (inefficient)
- Population: Limited by food production

**After iron** (Iron Age, 1200 BCE-present):
- Tools: Iron (abundant, cheap)
- Agriculture: Iron plows → 10× efficiency → food surplus
- Population: Explodes (more food = more people)

**The multiplier effect**:
```
1 bloomery → 50 lbs iron/week →
  50 tools (axes, plows, knives) →
    500 people fed (farming efficiency) +
    Buildings constructed (nails) +
    Infrastructure (wheels, hinges, chains) →
      EXPONENTIAL GROWTH
```

**Historical examples**:
- **Hittites** (1200 BCE): First iron weapons → conquered Bronze Age civilizations
- **Roman Empire**: Iron tools/weapons → built roads, aqueducts, conquered Europe
- **Medieval Europe**: Iron plows → agricultural revolution → population 3× in 300 years

**One bloomery operator unlocks modern civilization.**
