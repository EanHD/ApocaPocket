summary: Joining iron and steel pieces by heating to welding temperature and hammering
  together.
steps:
- 'Prepare joint surfaces: scarf (overlap) or butt joint, clean of scale and dirt.'
- Apply flux (borax or fine sand) to prevent oxidation at the joint.
- Heat both pieces to bright yellow/white heat (~1300°C for mild steel).
- Quickly bring pieces together and strike with firm, rapid hammer blows.
- Reheat and re-strike as needed; inspect by bending—a good weld won't separate.
warnings:
- Welding temperature steel throws sparks—clear flammable materials.
- Flux spatters on contact—wear eye protection and leather apron.

## Overview
Joining iron and steel pieces by heating to welding temperature and hammering together.

## Step-by-step
1. Prepare joint surfaces: scarf (overlap) or butt joint, clean of scale and dirt.
2. Apply flux (borax or fine sand) to prevent oxidation at the joint.
3. Heat both pieces to bright yellow/white heat (~1300°C for mild steel).
4. Quickly bring pieces together and strike with firm, rapid hammer blows.
5. Reheat and re-strike as needed; inspect by bending—a good weld won't separate.

## Warnings
- Welding temperature steel throws sparks—clear flammable materials.
- Flux spatters on contact—wear eye protection and leather apron.
