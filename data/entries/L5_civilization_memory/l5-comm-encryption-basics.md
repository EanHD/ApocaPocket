summary: Simple cipher methods for protecting sensitive communications from interception.
steps:
- Use substitution ciphers (Caesar shift) for basic privacy; easy but breakable.
- 'Use transposition ciphers: rearrange letter positions using a keyword grid.'
- Combine substitution + transposition for stronger encryption.
- 'One-time pad: use a random key as long as the message for unbreakable encryption.'
- Pre-distribute codebooks to trusted parties; destroy after use.
warnings:
- Simple ciphers are breakable by frequency analysis—don't rely on them for critical
  secrets.
- Key distribution is the hardest problem—protect keys physically.

## Overview
Simple cipher methods for protecting sensitive communications from interception.

## Step-by-step
1. Use substitution ciphers (Caesar shift) for basic privacy; easy but breakable.
2. Use transposition ciphers: rearrange letter positions using a keyword grid.
3. Combine substitution + transposition for stronger encryption.
4. One-time pad: use a random key as long as the message for unbreakable encryption.
5. Pre-distribute codebooks to trusted parties; destroy after use.

## Warnings
- Simple ciphers are breakable by frequency analysis—don't rely on them for critical secrets.
- Key distribution is the hardest problem—protect keys physically.
