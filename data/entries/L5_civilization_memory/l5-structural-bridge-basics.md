steps:
- 'Beam bridges: simplest type; span limited by material strength and depth.'
- 'Arch bridges: convert vertical loads to compression along the curve into abutments.'
- 'Suspension bridges: cables in tension carry the deck via hangers; requires strong

- Select bridge type based on span, materials available, and load requirements.
- Always include safety railings, approach grading, and drainage.
warnings:
- Dynamic loads (marching, wind) can cause resonance—break step on bridges.
- Abutments must be anchored in solid ground or rock.

## Overview
Fundamental bridge types, their load-carrying principles, and when to use each.

## Step-by-step
1. Beam bridges: simplest type; span limited by material strength and depth.
2. Arch bridges: convert vertical loads to compression along the curve into abutments.
3. Suspension bridges: cables in tension carry the deck via hangers; requires strong anchorages.
4. Select bridge type based on span, materials available, and load requirements.
5. Always include safety railings, approach grading, and drainage.

## Warnings
- Dynamic loads (marching, wind) can cause resonance—break step on bridges.
- Abutments must be anchored in solid ground or rock.
