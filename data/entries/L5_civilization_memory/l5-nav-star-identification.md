summary: Fifteen key navigation stars visible from different hemispheres and seasons. Knowing these stars lets you determine direction, approximate latitude, and time without instruments. Polaris gives
  true north; the Southern Cross gives true south; other stars rise due east and set due west.
warnings:
- Stars are only useful on clear nights — overcast skies require other navigation methods
- Magnetic declination does not affect stellar navigation, but light pollution makes stars hard to see near cities
- Stars move across the sky (~15° per hour) — take readings at known times for direction, or use stationary reference points (Polaris, Southern Cross method)
- Southern hemisphere has no true south pole star — use the Southern Cross method (less precise than Polaris)
steps:
- 'POLARIS (North Star) — Magnitude 2.0. FINDING IT: follow the two ''pointer stars'' at the end of the Big Dipper''s bowl (Dubhe and Merak) — they point directly to Polaris, which is at the tip of the
  Little Dipper''s handle. Polaris is within 1° of true north. Its altitude above the horizon equals your latitude (e.g., 45° altitude = 45°N latitude).'
- BIG DIPPER (Ursa Major) — Not a star but essential. Seven bright stars forming a ladle. Visible year-round above 40°N. Pointer stars aim at Polaris. The arc of the handle points to Arcturus ('arc to Arcturus').
  Rotates counterclockwise around Polaris through the night.
- 'SOUTHERN CROSS (Crux) — Four bright stars in a cross pattern, visible below ~25°N. To find south: extend the long axis of the cross 4.5 times its length downward — that point is roughly above true south
  on the horizon. Distinguish from False Cross (larger, dimmer, nearby).'
- ORION — The most recognizable constellation globally. Three belt stars in a line are visible from both hemispheres. Orion's belt rises due east and sets due west (useful for E-W orientation). Betelgeuse
  (top-left, red) and Rigel (bottom-right, blue-white) are among the brightest stars.
- SIRIUS (Dog Star) — Brightest star in the sky (magnitude -1.46). Found by following Orion's belt downward-left. Visible winter months (Nov-Mar) from most of the world. Rises due east.
- ARCTURUS — 4th brightest star. Orange color. Found by following the arc of the Big Dipper's handle ('arc to Arcturus'). Visible spring through fall in the northern hemisphere. Rises in the northeast.
- VEGA — 5th brightest star. Blue-white. Part of the Summer Triangle (with Deneb and Altair). Nearly overhead in summer at mid-northern latitudes. Will be the North Star in ~12,000 years due to precession.
- CANOPUS — 2nd brightest star. Visible from latitudes south of ~37°N. Important southern hemisphere navigation star. Low on the southern horizon from southern US/Mediterranean.
- CASSIOPEIA — W-shaped constellation opposite the Big Dipper from Polaris. When the Big Dipper is low/below horizon, Cassiopeia is high and points to Polaris. Visible year-round above 35°N.
- 'DIRECTION FROM ANY STAR: drive two sticks into the ground 2-3 feet apart, aligned with any bright star. Wait 15-20 minutes. If the star moved: LEFT = you''re facing roughly south. RIGHT = you''re facing
  roughly north. UP = you''re facing roughly east. DOWN = you''re facing roughly west. This works for any star except Polaris.'
