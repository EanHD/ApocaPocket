# Blacksmithing
**Level 5: Metallurgy & Manufacturing**

## Why This Matters
Blacksmithing is **THE MULTIPLIER PROFESSION**. One skilled blacksmith can:
- **Equip an entire village** with tools (axes, hoes, knives, nails)
- **Enable every other trade** (carpenters need saws, farmers need plows, builders need nails)
- **Repair & maintain** civilization's tools (broken tool = waste; repaired = years more use)

**Historical precedent**: In medieval villages, the blacksmith was the **most essential person** after the farmer. No blacksmith = no tools = no productivity = collapse.

**Productivity multiplier**:
```
1 blacksmith + forge + iron →
  10 axes/week (loggers cut 10× more wood) +
  20 hoes/week (farmers cultivate 10× more land) +
  500 nails/week (builders construct 10× faster) →
    ENTIRE COMMUNITY PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES 10×
```

## Forge Construction

### Basic Forge Design

**Components**:
1. **Firepot**: Central fire chamber (holds charcoal/coal, iron to be heated)
2. **Hearth**: Surrounding work surface (brick, stone, steel)
3. **Tuyere**: Air inlet pipe (from bellows/blower)
4. **Hood/chimney**: Exhaust ventilation (removes smoke, sparks)

### Materials

**Firepot**:
- **Cast iron bowl** (ideal, if available)
- **Steel plate** (weld/rivet into bowl shape)
- **Brick/clay**: Refractory (fire-resistant) brick lined chamber

**Hearth**:
- **Fire bricks**: Best (withstands 2500°F+)
- **Stone**: Granite, sandstone (avoid limestone—cracks from heat)
- **Thick steel plate** (1/4 inch+): Modern option

**Tuyere**:
- **Iron pipe**: 1-2 inch diameter, angled into firepot
- **Clay nozzle**: Traditional (shaped, fire-hardened)

### Construction (Simple Brick Forge)

**Dimensions**:
- Hearth: 3 ft × 3 ft × 3 ft tall (working height)
- Firepot: 12-16 inches diameter, 6-8 inches deep

**Steps**:
1. **Foundation**: Level ground or concrete pad
2. **Hearth walls**: Stack fire bricks with clay mortar (U-shape, open front)
3. **Firepot**: Center of hearth, slightly recessed (holds fire)
4. **Tuyere**: Insert pipe through side of firepot (45° upward angle)
5. **Hood**: Metal cone or brick arch above firepot (minimum 3 feet above fire)
6. **Chimney**: Extend hood 6-10 feet tall (strong draft essential)

**Airflow**: Bellows/blower → tuyere → blast into firepot → exhaust up chimney

## Fuel

### Coal (Best)
**Bituminous coal** (soft coal): Ideal for blacksmithing
- **Temperature**: 2500-3000°F (with forced air)
- **Burn time**: Long, consistent heat
- **Characteristics**: Little smoke once coked (impurities burned off)
- **Availability**: Mined (not always available post-collapse)

**How to use**:
1. Start with charcoal or wood fire (center of firepot)
2. Bank coal around edges (forms "coke" = purified coal)
3. Coke insulates fire, burns extremely hot
4. Add fresh coal to edges as coke burns (self-sustaining cycle)

### Charcoal (Good Alternative)
- **Temperature**: 2000-2200°F (with forced air)
- **Advantages**: Cleaner smoke, renewable (wood → charcoal), no impurities
- **Disadvantages**: Burns faster than coal, more volume needed
- **Source**: See l5-materials-charcoal-production.md

### Coke (Purified Coal)
- Coal heated without oxygen (like charcoal from wood)
- Burns hotter, cleaner than raw coal
- Industrial blacksmithing standard

**Avoid**: Regular wood (too cool, too smoky, doesn't maintain heat)

## Anvil

### What Makes a Good Anvil
**Requirements**:
- **Heavy**: 100-200 lbs (absorbs hammer impact, doesn't bounce)
- **Hard surface**: Tool steel (hardened, rebounds hammer)
- **Stable**: Mounted on solid base (stump, steel stand)

**Anatomy**:
- **Face**: Flat top surface (main work area)
- **Horn**: Curved pointed end (bending, rounding)
- **Hardy hole**: Square hole in face (holds bottom tools)
- **Pritchel hole**: Round hole (punching, riveting)

### Improvised Anvils (If No Anvil Available)

**Railroad rail** (best improvised option):
- Heavy (~100 lbs/yard), hard steel, flat face
- Mount vertically or horizontally on stand

**Large steel plate** (1-2 inches thick):
- Bolt to massive wood block or concrete
- Not ideal (no horn, no rebound) but functional

**Large stone** (granite, basalt):
- Flat surface, heavy, stable
- Ancient method (pre-iron anvils)
- Works for basic shaping (not precision work)

---

## Hammers & Tools

### Hammers (Essential)

**Cross-peen hammer** (2-3 lbs):
- Flat face + wedge-shaped peen (perpendicular to handle)
- Most versatile (drawing out, flattening, texturing)

**Ball-peen hammer** (2-3 lbs):
- Flat face + rounded peen
- Riveting, forging round shapes

**Sledgehammer** (8-12 lbs):
- Two-handed, heavy forging
- Requires striker (assistant) for large work

### Tongs (Critical)
**Purpose**: Hold hot iron without burning hands

**Types**:
- **Flat-jaw**: General purpose, flat stock
- **V-bit**: Round stock (rods)
- **Box-jaw**: Square stock
- **Pick-up**: Small pieces, nails

**DIY**: Forge your first tongs from rebar or scrap steel (tongs make tongs)

### Cutting Tools

**Hardy** (bottom tool, fits in hardy hole):
- Chisel edge pointing up
- Hot iron placed on edge, struck with hammer → cuts

**Hot cut** (hand-held chisel):
- Cut hot iron on anvil face
- Blunt edge (40-50° angle)—doesn't need to be razor-sharp

**Cold cut** (hardened chisel):
- Cut cold iron (requires more force)
- Sharper edge (30° angle), heat-treated (hardened)

### Punches & Drifts

**Punch**: Make holes in hot iron (drive through from one side)
**Drift**: Enlarge/shape holes (tapered, driven through hole)

### Other Essential Tools
- **Wire brush**: Clean scale (iron oxide) off hot iron
- **Water bucket**: Quenching (cooling rapidly), steam cleaning
- **Flux**: Borax (for welding, prevents oxidation)
- **Measuring tools**: Calipers, ruler, square (precision work)

## Heat Colors (CRITICAL SKILL)

**Iron changes color with temperature**—this is how blacksmiths judge heat without thermometers. **Master this chart**:

| Color | Temperature (°F) | Workability | Uses |
|-------|------------------|-------------|------|
| **Black heat** | <900°F | Barely visible in dark | Too cold to forge |
| **Blood red** | 900-1000°F | Dull red, dark room visible | Too cold, will crack |
| **Dark cherry** | 1000-1100°F | Visible in dim light | Straightening, light work |
| **Cherry red** | 1200-1400°F | Bright red, visible in daylight | **Forging range** (most work) |
| **Bright cherry** | 1400-1600°F | Bright red-orange | Heavy forging, drawing out |
| **Orange** | 1600-1900°F | Orange glow | Easy bending, welding (lower temp) |
| **Yellow** | 1900-2100°F | Yellow-orange | **Welding heat** (forge welding) |
| **Light yellow** | 2100-2300°F | Bright yellow | Highest safe temp |
| **White** | 2300-2500°F | **DANGER** | Burning (sparking, metal deteriorates) |

**Critical notes**:
- **Cherry red** (1200-1400°F): 90% of forging happens here
- **Yellow heat** (1900-2100°F): Forge welding (joining iron pieces)
- **White heat**: TOO HOT—iron is burning (sparks, crumbles)

**Judging heat**:
- **In bright daylight**: Hard to see color until orange+
- **In shade/dim forge**: Colors visible at lower temps
- **Practice**: Heat scrap iron, watch color progression

## Basic Forging Techniques

### 1. Drawing Out (Lengthening)
**Purpose**: Make stock longer and thinner (e.g., taper a point)

**Process**:
1. Heat iron to cherry red (1200-1400°F)
2. Place on anvil face
3. **Strike with hammer** at angle (push metal forward)
4. **Rotate iron 90°** after each blow (keeps round/square profile)
5. Reheat as needed (iron cools fast)

**Common use**: Making nails, spikes, knives, pointed tools

### 2. Upsetting (Thickening)
**Purpose**: Make stock shorter and thicker (concentrate mass)

**Process**:
1. Heat section to bright cherry/orange (1400-1600°F)
2. **Strike end-on** (drive into anvil or strike vertically)
3. Metal compresses, widens
4. Reheat frequently (work hardens quickly)

**Common use**: Bolt heads, hammer heads, tool eyes

### 3. Bending
**Purpose**: Change direction of stock (hooks, brackets, rings)

**Process**:
1. Heat to cherry red
2. **Leverage**: Use horn of anvil, bending fork, or hardy hole
3. **Gradual bends**: Multiple heats for sharp angles (avoid cracking)
4. **Cool gradually** for complex bends (rapid cooling = brittleness)

**Common use**: Hooks, hinges, decorative scrollwork

### 4. Punching (Making Holes)
**Purpose**: Create holes without drilling (faster, maintains grain structure)

**Process**:
1. Heat to bright cherry (1400°F+)
2. Place on anvil face
3. **Drive punch** halfway through (stop before breakthrough)
4. **Flip iron**, align punch mark
5. Drive punch from other side (cleaner hole)
6. **Drift** to final size/shape if needed

**Common use**: Eye of hammer/axe, hinges, chain links

### 5. Forge Welding (Joining Iron)
**Purpose**: Join two pieces of iron permanently (before modern welding)

**Process**:
1. **Scarf ends** (taper both pieces to match)
2. **Flux surfaces** (sprinkle borax on joint—prevents oxidation)
3. Heat both to **yellow-white** (1900-2100°F, nearly sparking)
4. **Quick work**: Remove from fire, place on anvil
5. **Strike firmly** (fuse pieces together)
6. **Reheat and hammer** to smooth joint (multiple heats)

**Critical**: Must be clean, correct temperature, flux, and strike quickly (oxidation prevents weld)

## Hardening & Tempering Steel

**Difference**:
- **Iron (wrought iron)**: Soft, malleable, doesn't harden (used for nails, hinges, structural)
- **Steel**: Iron + carbon (0.3-2%), can be hardened (used for cutting tools, springs)

### Hardening (Quenching)
**Purpose**: Make steel hard (able to hold cutting edge)

**Process**:
1. Heat steel to **critical temperature** (1400-1500°F for most steel, cherry-red to orange)
2. **Test with magnet**: When steel is non-magnetic, it's at critical temp
3. **Quench rapidly** in liquid:
   - **Water**: Fastest cooling, hardest result (risk of cracking)
   - **Oil**: Slower cooling, less risk of cracking (best for tools)
   - **Brine** (salt water): Faster than water (very hard, higher crack risk)
4. **Result**: Steel is now **very hard but brittle** (like glass)

### Tempering (Reducing Brittleness)
**Purpose**: Reduce brittleness while keeping hardness (functional tool)

**Process**:
1. **Clean steel** (wire brush, sandpaper) until shiny
2. **Reheat slowly** to tempering temperature (watch color change):
   - **Pale yellow** (400°F): Razors, knives (hardest)
   - **Straw yellow** (450°F): Chisels, axes (hard, slight flex)
   - **Brown** (500°F): Punches, plane irons
   - **Purple** (550°F): Springs, swords (flexible)
   - **Blue** (600°F): Very flexible (springs)
3. **Quench** when desired color reached (stops tempering)

**Oxide color chart** (appears during tempering):
```
Pale yellow → Straw → Brown → Purple → Blue
(Hardest)                              (Most flexible)
```

**Common mistake**: Skipping tempering → brittle tool shatters in use

## Safety

### Burns (Most Common Injury)
⚠️ **Hot iron looks cold after loses red glow** (still 500-900°F)
- Always use tongs (never assume iron is cool)
- Leather apron, long sleeves, closed-toe boots
- Organize workspace (clear path from forge to anvil)

### Fire Hazards
⚠️ **Sparks, hot scale (iron oxide chips), flying metal**
- Eye protection (safety glasses or face shield)
- Clear flammable materials (20-foot radius)
- Fire extinguisher or water nearby

### Ventilation
⚠️ **Coal/charcoal produce carbon monoxide (CO)**
- Forge outdoors or with excellent ventilation
- Chimney draws CO up and away (proper draft essential)
- Never operate forge in enclosed space

### Hearing Protection
- Hammering on steel = 100-120 dB (hearing damage)
- Earplugs for extended sessions

## Exponential Effect: One Smith → Equipped Community

**Historical example** (Medieval village, 100 people):
- **1 blacksmith** produces:
  - 50 nails/day × 6 days = 300 nails/week (builds 2-3 houses)
  - 10 tools/week (axes, hoes, knives) = 520 tools/year
  - Repairs: Broken tools fixed in hours (vs months to replace)

**Result**:
- Farmers: 10× productivity (iron plows vs wooden)
- Builders: 10× speed (nails vs joinery/rope)
- Hunters: 3× success rate (iron knives, arrowheads)
- **Community thrives** vs neighboring villages without smith → collapse

**Conclusion**: Blacksmith is **THE KEYSTONE PROFESSION**. Protect your blacksmith.
