# Glassmaking
**Level 5: Materials & Manufacturing**

## Why This Matters
Glass is a **civilization accelerator** that unlocks:
- **Light**: Windows (heating efficiency, vitamin D, illumination)
- **Storage**: Transparent, non-reactive containers (food, chemicals)
- **Optics**: Lenses, microscopes, telescopes (science revolution)
- **Laboratory equipment**: Beakers, test tubes (chemistry, medicine)
- **Communication**: Light bulbs, fiber optics (later tech)

Without glass, you cannot do modern science or medicine. **One glassmaker can supply optical tools that multiply human capability 100x.**

## Basic Chemistry: What Is Glass?

Glass = **molten sand + flux + stabilizer**, cooled rapidly to prevent crystallization

**Basic Formula** (soda-lime glass, 90% of all glass):
- **Silica (SiO₂)**: 70% — sand, quartz (glass-former)
- **Soda ash (Na₂CO₃)**: 15% — sodium carbonate (flux, lowers melting point)
- **Lime (CaO)**: 10% — limestone, crushed shells (stabilizer, durability)
- **Minor additives**: 5% — cullet (recycled glass), colorants, opacifiers

**Without flux**, pure silica melts at 3100°F (unattainable with wood/charcoal). Soda ash reduces melting point to **2000-2400°F** (achievable).

## Raw Materials

### Silica Sources
**Best**: 
- **White sand**: Beach/desert sand, washed to remove impurities
- **Quartz rock**: Crushed to powder (labor-intensive)
- **Sandstone**: Ground fine

**Test**: Pure silica is white/clear; iron = yellow/green tint (still usable)

### Flux (Soda Ash)
**Sources**:
1. **Wood ash** (traditional method):
   - Burn hardwood (beech, oak) completely to white ash
   - Soak in water, filter → lye solution
   - Boil down until white crystals form (sodium carbonate)
   - Yield: ~5-10 lbs ash → 1 lb soda ash

2. **Seaweed ash** (kelp, especially in coastal areas):
   - Burn dried seaweed → high sodium content
   - Traditional method in Europe/Mediterranean

3. **Mineral sources**: Natron (natural sodium carbonate deposits in dry lakes)

### Lime (Stabilizer)
**Sources**:
- **Limestone**: Crushed marble, chalk, shells
- **Burn limestone** at 1600°F → quicklime (CaO)
- **Slake with water** → hydrated lime (Ca(OH)₂)
- Dry and grind to powder

## Glass Furnace Construction

### Small Furnace (50-100 lbs glass capacity)

**Materials**:
- **Refractory brick** or **firebrick** (withstands 2500°F+)
  - Alternative: Clay mixed with 50% sand (fired to harden)
  - Or: High-alumina clay (best insulation)
- **Steel frame** or stone support structure
- **Crucibles**: Clay/graphite pots (hold molten glass)

**Dimensions**:
- **Melting chamber**: 3 ft wide × 3 ft deep × 4 ft tall
- **Wall thickness**: 9-12 inches (insulation critical)
- **Firebox**: Below or beside melting chamber
- **Chimney**: 10-15 ft tall (strong draft essential)

### Airflow Design
**Updraft furnace**:
1. **Firebox**: Bottom chamber, burn fuel
2. **Grate**: Allows ash to fall, air to flow up
3. **Crucible chamber**: Pots sit on shelf above firebox
4. **Crown/roof**: Arched, reflects heat downward
5. **Chimney**: Exhaust, creates draft

**Critical**: Forced air (bellows or blower) required to reach 2000-2400°F

---

## Fuel Requirements

**Best fuels** (by temperature):
1. **Coal/coke**: Highest heat (2500°F+), cleanest, long burn
2. **Charcoal**: Good heat (2000-2200°F), cleaner than wood
3. **Wood**: Barely sufficient (1800-2000°F), smoky, high volume needed
4. **Natural gas**: Ideal if available (clean, controllable)

**Fuel consumption**: 
- Small furnace: 50-100 lbs charcoal per 8-hour melt
- Or: 150-300 lbs wood per melt

**Wood → Charcoal** first (see l5-materials-charcoal-production.md) for better results.

## Glassmaking Process

### Step 1: Batch Preparation
**Recipe** (10 lbs batch):
- Silica (sand): 7 lbs (70%)
- Soda ash: 1.5 lbs (15%)
- Lime: 1 lb (10%)
- Cullet (recycled glass): 0.5 lbs (5%) — speeds melting

**Mixing**:
1. Weigh ingredients precisely
2. Mix dry in large container
3. Add water to make thick paste (reduces dust, helps mixing)
4. Dry thoroughly before loading into crucible

### Step 2: Melting (8-12 hours)
1. **Preheat crucibles** gradually (2-3 hours) to avoid cracking
2. **Load batch** into hot crucibles (half-full)
3. **Increase heat** gradually to 2000°F over 2-3 hours
4. **Hold at 2200-2400°F** for 4-6 hours
   - Bubbles rise and escape
   - Ingredients fully dissolve
   - Glass becomes clear, honey-like consistency
5. **Skimming**: Remove scum/impurities from surface with metal rod

**Visual indicators**:
- Too cool: Thick, doesn't flow, bubbles trapped
- Just right: Flows like honey, few bubbles, clear
- Too hot: Thin as water, crucible erodes, dangerous

### Step 3: Working (Techniques)

#### Glass Blowing
**Tools**:
- **Blowpipe**: Hollow iron tube, 4-5 ft long
- **Pontil rod**: Solid rod for holding/shaping
- **Wooden paddles (blocks)**: Shape while turning
- **Shears**: Cut/trim glass
- **Marver**: Flat steel/stone surface for rolling

**Process**:
1. Heat blowpipe tip in furnace
2. Gather molten glass on tip (rotate constantly)
3. Roll on marver to center and shape
4. Blow gently through pipe (bubble forms inside)
5. Reheat as needed (glass cools fast)
6. Shape with paddles, shears, gravity
7. Transfer to pontil rod to finish opening
8. **Anneal** immediately after finishing

#### Molding & Casting
1. **Make mold**: Clay, plaster, carved stone (heat-resistant)
2. **Preheat mold** to 400-600°F (prevents cracking)
3. **Pour molten glass** or **press with tool**
4. **Cool in mold** until solid
5. **Anneal** properly (critical)

#### Flat Glass (Windows)
**Crown method** (medieval technique):
1. Blow large bubble
2. Spin rapidly on pontil rod while very hot
3. Centrifugal force → flattens into disk
4. Cut into panes (center has "bullseye" knob)

**Cylinder method** (better flatness):
1. Blow long cylinder
2. Cut ends off
3. Split lengthwise with hot iron
4. Reheat and flatten in annealing oven

## Annealing (CRITICAL: Prevents Shattering)

**What is annealing?** Controlled slow cooling to remove internal stress. **Without it, glass shatters from thermal shock** (even small temperature changes).

**Process**:
1. **Transfer finished piece** to annealing oven (separate from melting furnace)
2. **Hold at 900-1000°F** for 30 minutes to 2 hours (depending on thickness)
   - Thick pieces: Longer soak
   - Thin pieces: Shorter soak
3. **Cool slowly**: 50-100°F per hour to room temperature
   - Total time: 8-24 hours for most pieces
4. **Never rush cooling** — cracks/explosions can occur

**Annealing oven**: Insulated box with controlled heat source (residual furnace heat, hot coals, gas burner)

## Colorants & Special Glass

**Add to batch** (small percentages):

| Additive | Color | Amount |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Iron oxide (rust) | Green/brown | 0.5-2% |
| Copper oxide (malachite) | Blue/green | 0.5-1% |
| Cobalt oxide | Deep blue | 0.1-0.5% |
| Manganese oxide | Purple/clear | 0.5-1% |
| Selenium | Red/pink | 0.1-0.3% |
| Carbon (soot) | Amber/brown | 0.2-0.5% |

**Clear/colorless glass**: Very difficult (requires pure materials, decolorizers). Most primitive glass is green/blue due to iron impurities.

## Safety (CRITICAL)

### Fire & Heat Hazards
⚠️ **Molten glass**: 2000-2400°F, causes instant severe burns
- Wear: Leather gloves, apron, long sleeves, closed-toe boots
- Eye protection: Dark welding goggles (infrared radiation)
- Never lean over furnace or crucibles

⚠️ **Steam explosions**: Water + molten glass = violent explosion
- Keep ALL water away from furnace area
- No wet tools, no perspiration in glass
- Dry all tools thoroughly before use

⚠️ **Furnace collapse**: Refractory failure can dump molten glass
- Inspect bricks regularly for cracks
- Replace deteriorated sections immediately
- Have sand nearby to contain spills (never water)

### Toxic Fumes
⚠️ **Lead**: Historic glass used lead oxide (DO NOT USE without training)
- Modern substitute: Barium or strontium compounds

⚠️ **Fluorine compounds**: Some fluxes release toxic fumes
- Work outdoors or with excellent ventilation
- Avoid breathing furnace exhaust

### Respiratory
⚠️ **Silica dust**: Causes silicosis (lethal lung disease)
- Wet sand before mixing (no dry dust)
- Wear dust mask during batch preparation

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Glass won't melt | Temperature too low | Increase airflow, use better fuel |
| Bubbles in glass | Not enough melting time | Hold at peak temp 2+ hours longer |
| Cracks during annealing | Cooled too fast | Slower cooling rate, better insulation |
| Green/brown tint | Iron in sand | Purer silica source, or add manganese (decolorizer) |
| Glass shatters when working | Not hot enough | Reheat frequently, keep above 1000°F |
| Crucible cracks | Thermal shock | Preheat slowly, use refractory clay |

## Progression Path

**Beginner**: Cast glass in molds (easiest, no blowing skill)
**Intermediate**: Blown vessels (bottles, cups)
**Advanced**: Flat glass (windows), optical grinding (lenses)
**Expert**: Scientific apparatus, specialty glass (lead-free optical)

**Time to proficiency**:
- Casting: 2-4 weeks practice
- Blowing: 6-12 months for basic shapes
- Optical work: 2-5 years for precision lenses

## Historical Context

**3500 BCE**: First man-made glass (Mesopotamia, Egypt) — beads, glazes
**1500 BCE**: Hollow glass vessels (core-forming technique)
**50 BCE**: Glass blowing invented (Roman Syria) — **REVOLUTION**
- Before: Glass was rare luxury
- After: Common household item (bottles, windows)

**1200s CE**: Venice becomes glass capital (Murano island)
**1608 CE**: Telescope invented (ground glass lenses) → astronomy revolution
**1675 CE**: Microscope perfected → biology revolution

**Why it matters**: Glass enabled the Scientific Revolution. Without microscopes (glass lenses), germ theory is impossible. Without telescopes, modern astronomy doesn't exist. Without lab glassware, chemistry remains alchemy.

**One glassmaker supplies thousands with containers and optical tools.** The productivity multiplier is enormous.
