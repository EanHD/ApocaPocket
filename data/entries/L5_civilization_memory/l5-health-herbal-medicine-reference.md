summary: Fifteen medicinal plants with the strongest scientific evidence for efficacy. Ordered by usefulness in a survival/grid-down scenario. All are common in temperate regions or easily cultivated. Evidence
  ratings based on systematic reviews and WHO monographs.
warnings:
- Herbal medicine has REAL pharmacological effects — which means real side effects, drug interactions, and overdose potential
- Dose matters — 'natural' does not mean 'safe at any dose'. Comfrey, foxglove, and many others are toxic at moderate doses.
- Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid most herbal medicines — many cause uterine contractions or pass to infant
- NEVER use herbal remedies as a substitute for wound cleaning, rehydration, or other proven first aid
- Correct identification is CRITICAL — many medicinal plants have toxic lookalikes
steps:
- 'WILLOW BARK (Salix spp.) — The original aspirin. Contains salicin. USE: pain relief, fever reduction, anti-inflammatory. DOSE: chew fresh inner bark, or steep 1-2 tsp dried bark per cup hot water for
  15 min. 3 cups/day max. EVIDENCE: Strong — well-studied analgesic. WARNING: same contraindications as aspirin (bleeding risk, children under 16, stomach ulcers).'
- 'HONEY (raw) — Powerful wound medicine. USE: wound dressing, cough suppressant, burn treatment. Bactericidal against MRSA, E. coli, Pseudomonas. DOSE: apply directly to wounds under clean bandage, change
  daily. For coughs: 1-2 tsp straight. EVIDENCE: Very strong — multiple RCTs. Medical-grade honey (Manuka) is most studied, but all raw honey has antimicrobial properties.'
- 'GARLIC (Allium sativum) — Broad-spectrum antimicrobial. USE: internal antimicrobial, immune support, cardiovascular. Contains allicin (released when crushed). DOSE: 1-2 raw crushed cloves daily. Crush
  and wait 10 minutes before eating (activates allicin). EVIDENCE: Moderate — antimicrobial properties well-demonstrated in vitro, weaker clinical data.'
- 'CHAMOMILE (Matricaria chamomilla) — Calming and anti-inflammatory. USE: anxiety, insomnia, GI cramps, wound wash. DOSE: steep 1 tbsp dried flowers per cup hot water for 10 min. Up to 4 cups/day. Topical:
  cooled strong tea as wound wash. EVIDENCE: Moderate — anxiolytic and GI effects well-supported.'
- 'PLANTAIN (Plantago major) — The field medic''s plant. USE: insect bites/stings (immediate relief), minor wound poultice, anti-inflammatory. DOSE: chew fresh leaf to make a poultice (''spit poultice''),
  apply directly to bite/wound. Or steep dried leaves for wound-wash tea. EVIDENCE: Moderate — anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties confirmed.'
- 'YARROW (Achillea millefolium) — Wound herb. USE: stop bleeding (hemostatic), wound disinfection, fever reduction. DOSE: crush fresh leaves and pack directly on bleeding wounds. Tea: 1-2 tsp dried herb
  per cup, steep 10 min, for fever. EVIDENCE: Moderate — traditional hemostatic use supported by studies showing it promotes platelet aggregation.'
- 'PEPPERMINT (Mentha piperita) — GI remedy. USE: nausea, indigestion, IBS symptoms, headache. DOSE: tea from fresh or dried leaves, 1-2 tsp per cup, steep 10 min. For headache: crush fresh leaves and apply
  to temples. EVIDENCE: Strong for GI symptoms — multiple RCTs for IBS.'
- 'ECHINACEA (Echinacea purpurea) — Immune stimulant. USE: reducing duration/severity of colds and upper respiratory infections. DOSE: tea from roots and/or flowers, 1-2 tsp per cup, 3x daily at onset of
  symptoms. Continue for 7-10 days. EVIDENCE: Moderate — meta-analyses show modest reduction in cold duration (1-2 days). Most effective when started at first symptoms.'
- 'ALOE VERA — Burn and skin treatment. USE: minor burns, sunburn, skin irritation, wound healing. DOSE: split leaf, apply clear gel directly to affected area 2-3x daily. EVIDENCE: Strong for burns — accelerates
  healing and reduces pain in clinical studies. Not effective for deep burns.'
- 'GINGER (Zingiber officinale) — Anti-nausea. USE: nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, digestive aid. DOSE: fresh root sliced and steeped in hot water (1 inch of root per cup), or chew fresh root.
  EVIDENCE: Strong — as effective as some pharmaceutical anti-emetics in RCTs. Safe in pregnancy for nausea.'
- 'TURMERIC (Curcuma longa) — Anti-inflammatory. USE: joint pain, inflammation, digestive support. Contains curcumin. DOSE: 1 tsp powder in warm water/milk daily. Add black pepper (increases curcumin absorption
  2000%). EVIDENCE: Moderate — anti-inflammatory effects supported, bioavailability is the main limitation.'
- 'ELDERBERRY (Sambucus nigra) — Antiviral. USE: influenza prevention and treatment. DOSE: syrup from cooked berries, 1 tbsp 3x daily during illness. CAUTION: RAW berries, leaves, and stems are toxic (contain
  cyanogenic glycosides) — must be cooked. EVIDENCE: Moderate — reduces flu duration by 3-4 days in small trials.'
- 'VALERIAN (Valeriana officinalis) — Sleep aid. USE: insomnia, anxiety, muscle relaxation. DOSE: tea from dried root, 1-2 tsp per cup, steep 15 min. Take 30-60 minutes before bed. EVIDENCE: Moderate —
  improves sleep quality in meta-analyses, but effects are modest.'
- 'COMFREY (Symphytum officinale) — Bone and joint healing. USE: topical only for sprains, fractures, bruises, joint pain. Contains allantoin (promotes cell growth). DOSE: poultice of crushed fresh leaves
  or root applied to affected area. NEVER TAKE INTERNALLY — contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that cause liver failure. EVIDENCE: Strong for topical musculoskeletal use.'
- 'TEA TREE (Melaleuca alternifolia) — Antiseptic. USE: wound disinfection, fungal infections, insect repellent. DOSE: dilute essential oil (if available) with carrier oil; or steep fresh leaves for antimicrobial
  wash. EVIDENCE: Strong — antimicrobial and antifungal properties well-established. NOT for internal use.'
