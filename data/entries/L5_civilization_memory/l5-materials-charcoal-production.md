# Charcoal Production
**Level 5: Materials & Manufacturing**

## Why This Matters
Charcoal is **THE FUEL THAT UNLOCKS METALLURGY**. Without charcoal, you cannot:
- **Smelt iron** (bloomery requires 2300-2500°F; wood maxes at 1800°F)
- **Forge steel** (needs sustained high heat for shaping/hardening)
- **Cast bronze** (1900°F; wood burns too cool and smoky)
- **Make glass** (2000-2400°F; charcoal burns cleaner)

**Temperature comparison**:
- Wood fire: 1100-1800°F (open flame)
- Charcoal fire: 2000-2700°F (with forced air)

**Charcoal = 2× the heat, 1/4 the smoke, portable, storable.** No charcoal = no Iron Age = no civilization as we know it.

## What Is Charcoal?

**Chemistry**: Wood heated in low-oxygen environment (pyrolysis)
- **Input**: Wood (cellulose, lignin, water, volatiles)
- **Process**: Heat drives off water, gases, tar → leaves pure carbon
- **Output**: Charcoal (85-95% carbon, lightweight, porous)

**Why it burns hotter**:
- Wood: 50% volatile compounds → burn fast, cool flame
- Charcoal: 85% fixed carbon → burns slow, extremely hot

**Energy density**:
- Wood: 8,000-9,000 BTU/lb
- Charcoal: 12,000-14,000 BTU/lb

## Wood Selection

### Best Woods (Hardwoods)
**High-density hardwoods produce best charcoal**:

| Wood Species | Charcoal Quality | Yield % | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|---------|-------|
| **Oak** | Excellent | 25-30% | Gold standard, burns hottest |
| **Maple** (sugar, hard) | Excellent | 25-28% | Dense, long burn |
| **Hickory** | Excellent | 24-28% | Very hard, high heat |
| **Ash** | Very good | 23-26% | Easy to split, good heat |
| **Birch** | Good | 20-24% | Slightly lower heat |
| **Beech** | Excellent | 25-28% | European favorite |

### Avoid Softwoods (Pine, Spruce, Fir)
**Problems**:
- High resin content → smokier, sparks, lower yield
- Lower density → less charcoal per volume
- Acceptable if hardwoods unavailable (yield 15-20%)

### Wood Preparation
**Size**: Split logs 3-6 inches diameter
- Too thin: Burns to ash before charring
- Too thick: Doesn't char completely (wood core remains)

**Moisture**: Dry wood (air-dried 6-12 months ideal)
- Wet wood: Wastes energy evaporating water, lower yield
- Bone-dry: Best results, faster process

**Quantity**: 4:1 ratio (wood to charcoal by weight)
- 100 lbs wood → 25 lbs charcoal (typical)

## Earth/Pit Kiln Method (Easiest, No Equipment)

**Yield**: 20-25% (lower than drum, but simple)

### Construction
1. **Site selection**:
   - Flat ground, away from trees/buildings (fire hazard)
   - Windbreak area (prevents uncontrolled burning)
   - Near water source (emergency extinguishing)

2. **Dig pit**:
   - **Size**: 3-4 feet diameter, 2-3 feet deep
   - **Shape**: Tapered sides (easier loading/unloading)
   - **Center stake**: 4-inch diameter pole (creates chimney)

3. **Airflow vents**:
   - Dig 3-4 trenches from pit bottom to edge (3 inches wide, 3 inches deep)
   - These supply oxygen during initial burn phase

### Loading & Firing
1. **Base layer**: Dry kindling around center stake
2. **Stack wood**: Lean split logs teepee-style around stake
   - Pack tightly (reduces airflow)
   - Fill pit completely
3. **Remove center stake** carefully (leaves vertical chimney)
4. **Light fire** at bottom through airflow vents
5. **Cover progressively**:
   - Let burn vigorously 1-2 hours (flames visible at top)
   - Once wood glowing, cover with:
     - **Layer 1**: Sheet metal, flat stones, or green wood (leaves small vent holes)
     - **Layer 2**: 6 inches dirt/soil (seal most airflow)
     - **Leave small vents** initially (white smoke = water/volatiles escaping)

6. **Monitor smoke**:
   - **White/gray smoke**: Water and volatiles burning off (1-4 hours)
   - **Blue/thin smoke**: Charcoal forming (good sign)
   - **No smoke**: Completely sealed or finished
   - **Yellow flames**: Too much oxygen (seal better)

7. **Cooking time**: 12-24 hours
   - Small pit (3 ft): 12-16 hours
   - Large pit (6 ft): 18-24 hours

8. **Cool down**: 24-48 hours
   - **DO NOT UNCOVER EARLY** → charcoal burns to ash
   - Test: Touch ground above pit—should be cool
   - Uncover carefully (hot spots may remain)

### Yield & Quality
- **Good charcoal**: Lightweight, black, metallic ring when tapped, breaks cleanly
- **Overcooked**: Gray ash, crumbles to dust (too much oxygen)
- **Undercooked**: Brown, still smells like wood, heavy (insufficient heat/time)

---

## Drum/Barrel Kiln (Better Yield & Control)

**Yield**: 25-30% (more efficient than pit)

### Materials
- **Barrel**: 55-gallon steel drum (burn out paint/coating first)
- **Chimney pipe**: 3-4 inch diameter, 3-4 feet tall
- **Lid**: Flat steel plate or cut drum top (with holes)
- **Stand**: Bricks or metal legs (6-12 inches off ground)

### Construction
1. **Drum preparation**:
   - Cut 1-inch hole in center of drum lid (for chimney)
   - Drill 8-12 holes (1/2 inch) around drum bottom (air intake)
   - **BURN OUT BARREL FIRST** (empty, hot fire 1 hour—removes toxic coatings)

2. **Assembly**:
   - Raise drum on bricks/stand (airflow underneath)
   - Insert chimney through lid hole
   - Create adjustable vents for bottom holes (slide metal plates to open/close)

### Operation
1. **Load drum**:
   - Fill 80-90% with split wood (3-6 inch pieces)
   - Pack moderately tight (not too loose, not crushed together)

2. **Light from top**:
   - Place kindling on top of wood pile
   - Light fire, leave lid off initially

3. **Burn-off phase** (2-4 hours):
   - Flames vigorous from top
   - White/gray smoke (water and volatiles burning)
   - **Let burn until smoke thins, becomes blue-ish**

4. **Seal & cook**:
   - Place lid on drum (chimney in hole)
   - Close bottom vents 50-75% (reduce oxygen)
   - **Thin blue smoke** should continue from chimney
   - If heavy yellow smoke/flames: Too much air (close vents more)
   - If no smoke: Too sealed (crack vent slightly)

5. **Cooking time**: 8-12 hours
   - Watch smoke color (blue/thin = good)
   - When smoke nearly stops → almost done

6. **Sealing**:
   - **Close all vents completely** (suffocate remaining fire)
   - Seal chimney with metal plug or wet cloth
   - Let cool 12-24 hours

7. **Harvest**:
   - Open carefully (check for hot spots)
   - Pour charcoal into container
   - **Quench any glowing embers** with water (small amounts)

## Retort System (Advanced: Captures Byproducts)

**Yield**: 30-35% + wood gas, tar, vinegar

**Concept**: Drum inside drum—inner drum sealed (no oxygen), outer drum heats it

### Design
- **Inner drum**: Sealed (small vent for gases to escape)
- **Outer drum**: Firebox, burns wood to heat inner drum
- **Condenser**: Pipe coils to cool/capture wood gas → tar + wood vinegar (acetic acid)

**Benefits**:
- **Charcoal**: Main product (higher yield, cleaner)
- **Wood tar**: Waterproofing, adhesives, preservatives
- **Wood vinegar**: Antiseptic, preservative, insect repellent
- **Wood gas**: Can be burned for heat (powers engine in emergencies)

**Complexity**: Requires welding, plumbing, more skill—worth it for larger operations

## Safety (CRITICAL)

### Fire Hazards
⚠️ **Charcoal kilns = EXTREME FIRE RISK**
- Clear 30-foot radius (no dry grass, leaves, structures)
- Have water/sand nearby (minimum 20 gallons water)
- Never leave unattended during burn phase
- Wind can spread embers—check weather forecast

⚠️ **Underground fires**: Pit kilns can ignite roots, spread underground
- Dig to mineral soil (no organic matter)
- Monitor area for days after (hidden smoldering)

### Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
⚠️ **CO is ODORLESS, COLORLESS, LETHAL**
- **NEVER operate charcoal kiln indoors or enclosed space**
- Even outdoor kilns: Stay upwind, don't lean over
- Symptoms: Headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion → death
- If symptoms appear: Fresh air immediately, seek medical help

⚠️ **Cooling kilns still produce CO**: Don't approach sealed kiln for 24 hours

### Burns
⚠️ **Charcoal stays hot for 24-48 hours**
- Looks cold (black, no glow) but can be 500°F+ internally
- Wear gloves, long sleeves when harvesting
- Pour onto non-flammable surface
- Keep water nearby for spot quenching

### Explosions
⚠️ **Sealed drum + pressure buildup = explosion**
- Never seal drum completely during burn phase
- Chimney or vent must remain open
- If pressure builds (whistling, bulging): Open vent immediately

## Uses for Charcoal

### Metallurgy (Primary Use)
- **Bloomery furnace**: Iron smelting (requires 3:1 charcoal:ore ratio)
- **Forge**: Blacksmithing, tool making
- **Crucible melting**: Bronze, brass, aluminum casting
- **Heat treatment**: Hardening steel, annealing

### Water Filtration
- **Activated charcoal**: Crush + steam treatment → extremely porous
- **Removes**: Heavy metals, chlorine, organic compounds, toxins
- **DIY filter**: Layers of sand, gravel, crushed charcoal

### Soil Amendment (Biochar)
- **Charcoal in soil**: Increases fertility, retains moisture, lasts centuries
- **Terra preta** (Amazonian dark earth): 2000+ years old, still fertile
- **Application**: Crush charcoal, mix with compost, add to soil

### Cooking & Heating
- **Clean fuel**: Minimal smoke (vs wood)
- **High heat**: Grilling, searing
- **Portable**: Lightweight, easy to transport/store

### Gunpowder (Advanced)
- **Black powder**: Charcoal (15%) + sulfur (10%) + saltpeter/potassium nitrate (75%)
- **Must be ultra-fine charcoal** (willow/alder best for powder)

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Charcoal turns to ash | Too much oxygen | Seal vents better, cover with more dirt |
| Wood doesn't char | Not enough heat/time | Cook longer, better insulation, drier wood |
| Low yield (< 20%) | Wet wood, too much airflow | Use dry wood, reduce oxygen during cooking |
| Charcoal smells like wood | Under-cooked | Cook longer, ensure thin blue smoke phase |
| Drum bulges/explodes | Sealed too tight, pressure buildup | Always leave chimney/vent open during burn |
| Fire goes out too soon | Not enough initial fuel | Start with more kindling, better airflow initially |

## Yield Optimization

**Maximize charcoal production**:
1. **Use hardwoods** (oak, maple, hickory) → 25-30% yield
2. **Dry wood** (6-12 months air-dried) → +5-10% yield
3. **Controlled oxygen** (too much = ash, too little = incomplete) → +5% yield
4. **Proper sizing** (3-6 inch pieces) → even charring
5. **Monitor smoke** (blue = good, white = too early, none = sealed) → quality control

**Large-scale production**:
- **Multiple drums**: Stagger production (one cooling, one cooking, one loading)
- **Permanent kilns**: Brick kilns (like pottery kilns) for continuous operation

## Historical Context

**Ancient charcoal use**:
- **30,000 BCE**: Cave paintings (charcoal for art)
- **3000 BCE**: Bronze Age smelting (charcoal fuel)
- **1200 BCE**: Iron Age begins (bloomery furnaces require charcoal)
- **Roman Empire**: Massive charcoal industry (deforestation of Mediterranean)

**Middle Ages**:
- **Charcoal burners**: Professional class, lived in forests
- **Technique**: Earth mounds (10-50 tons wood per burn)
- **Industrial scale**: England, Germany produced millions of tons/year

**Why civilization depended on charcoal**:
- **Iron tools**: Enabled agriculture (plows), construction (nails), warfare (swords)
- **Without charcoal**: Iron Age never happens → stuck in Bronze Age

**Modern decline**:
- **1800s**: Coal replaces charcoal (higher heat, abundant)
- **Today**: Charcoal for cooking (BBQ), specialized metallurgy

**Restart scenario**: Charcoal production is FIRST PRIORITY for establishing metallurgy. One person making charcoal → entire community gets iron tools.
