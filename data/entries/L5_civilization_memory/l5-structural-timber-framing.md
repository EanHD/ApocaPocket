summary: Post-and-beam construction techniques using large timbers joined with traditional
  joinery.
steps:
- Select straight, seasoned hardwood timbers; size posts and beams to span requirements.
- Cut mortise-and-tenon joints for beam-to-post connections.
- Secure joints with wooden pegs (treenails) driven through offset holes for draw-boring.
- Raise bents (assembled frames) and connect with plates, girts, and braces.
- Add diagonal bracing to resist lateral forces (wind, earthquake).
warnings:
- Green timber shrinks and loosens joints—season wood before use.
- Raising heavy bents requires coordinated crew and safe rigging.

## Overview
Post-and-beam construction techniques using large timbers joined with traditional joinery.

## Step-by-step
1. Select straight, seasoned hardwood timbers; size posts and beams to span requirements.
2. Cut mortise-and-tenon joints for beam-to-post connections.
3. Secure joints with wooden pegs (treenails) driven through offset holes for draw-boring.
4. Raise bents (assembled frames) and connect with plates, girts, and braces.
5. Add diagonal bracing to resist lateral forces (wind, earthquake).

## Warnings
- Green timber shrinks and loosens joints—season wood before use.
- Raising heavy bents requires coordinated crew and safe rigging.
