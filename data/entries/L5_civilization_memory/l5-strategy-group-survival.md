summary: Solo survival is hard. Group survival is harder in different ways. 2-3 people = force multiplier. 10+ people = community with governance needs. 50+ people = civilization with specialization and
  politics. This entry covers group dynamics, decision-making, conflict resolution, and leadership at each scale.
warnings:
- Groups fail from internal conflict more often than resource scarcity — managing personalities is a survival skill
- Children and elderly change group priorities dramatically — they cannot contribute equally but must be protected
- The 'obvious leader' in an emergency is often not the right long-term leader — skills that get you through Day 1 ≠ skills that build a community
- Democracy sounds good but can be deadly when fast decisions are needed — adapt governance to the situation
steps:
- '2-3 PEOPLE (pair/small group): Advantages = shared watch, skill diversity, emotional support. Challenges = personality conflicts with no buffer. Governance: consensus (everyone must agree on major decisions).
  Roles: rotate tasks or divide by skill. Survival tip: Establish communication norms early (how to disagree without fracturing). Biggest failure mode: one person dominates, others become resentful or passive.'
- '4-8 PEOPLE (family/small team): Advantages = specialization begins (someone focuses on fire, someone on water, someone on food). Challenges = freeloaders become obvious, cliques form. Governance: designated
  leader for quick decisions, group discussion for major changes (where to camp, when to move). Roles: clear task assignments. Survival tip: Daily group check-in to air grievances before they explode. Biggest
  failure mode: ''us vs them'' splits within the group.'
- '9-20 PEOPLE (extended family/small community): Advantages = real surplus capacity (some people can focus on long-term projects while others handle daily needs), defense against threats, knowledge diversity.
  Challenges = coordination overhead, resource allocation disputes, social hierarchy forms naturally. Governance: council of 3-5 representatives, rotate leadership on major projects. Roles: specialization
  by skill (hunter, builder, medic, teacher). Survival tip: Written rules/expectations prevent ''but I thought...'' conflicts. Biggest failure mode: charismatic leader becomes tyrant or incompetent leaders
  aren''t replaced.'
- '21-50 PEOPLE (village): Advantages = true division of labor, trade, cultural life (music, games, celebration), education system. Challenges = food production becomes critical (foraging won''t feed 50),
  sanitation and disease, crime/disputes. Governance: representative democracy or council of elders. Formal conflict resolution process. Roles: full specialization (farmers, builders, smiths, teachers,
  guards, healers). Survival tip: Invest in infrastructure (wells, latrines, storage) early. Biggest failure mode: disease outbreak or food shortage causes collapse.'
- '51-150 PEOPLE (town): You''ve entered civilization rebuilding. Advantages = economy, redundancy (if one smith dies, there''s another), defense, trade with other settlements. Challenges = politics, inequality,
  resource management at scale. Governance: formal legal system, elected or appointed officials, taxation/tribute to fund public works. Survival tip: Document everything (laws, techniques, history). Biggest
  failure mode: resource depletion (overfarming, overhunting, deforestation) or violent conflict with other groups.'
- 'CRITICAL GROUP PRINCIPLES: (1) Share information transparently — secrets breed mistrust. (2) Rotate hard/easy tasks — resentment builds when the same person always digs latrines. (3) Celebrate together
  — shared joy bonds groups. (4) Exile is sometimes necessary — one toxic person can destroy a group (but do it humanely if possible). (5) Children = hope. Protect and educate them. They''re the future.
  (6) Elders = memory. Their knowledge is irreplaceable even if they can''t work physically.'
- 'DECISION-MAKING MODELS: AUTOCRATIC (one person decides — fast, used in emergencies). CONSENSUS (everyone agrees — slow, used for major decisions like moving camp). DEMOCRATIC (vote — medium speed, used
  for policy). ROTATION (different leader for different domains — medic leads medical decisions, hunter leads food strategy). Match model to situation.'
- 'CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Catch problems early (daily check-ins). Separate disputing parties, hear both sides privately. Neutral mediator. Focus on needs/interests, not positions (''I need to sleep'' vs ''You
  must stop snoring''). Creative solutions. If resolution fails: separation (assign people to different tasks/areas) or exile in extreme cases. Violence is contagious — stop it immediately.'

# Group Survival Dynamics — From Family to Community
