summary: How to harden and temper steel tools for optimal edge retention and toughness.
steps:
- Heat steel to critical temperature (cherry red, ~800°C) uniformly.
- Quench in water or oil for maximum hardness (martinsite formation).
- Clean the surface bright to observe temper colors.
- 'Reheat slowly and watch oxide colors: straw (220°C) for cutting edges, blue (300°C)
  for springs.'
- Quench again when desired color reaches the working edge.
warnings:
- Over-hardened steel is brittle and shatters—always temper after hardening.
- Quenching hot metal in water produces steam—keep face clear.

## Overview
How to harden and temper steel tools for optimal edge retention and toughness.

## Step-by-step
1. Heat steel to critical temperature (cherry red, ~800°C) uniformly.
2. Quench in water or oil for maximum hardness (martinsite formation).
3. Clean the surface bright to observe temper colors.
4. Reheat slowly and watch oxide colors: straw (220°C) for cutting edges, blue (300°C) for springs.
5. Quench again when desired color reaches the working edge.

## Warnings
- Over-hardened steel is brittle and shatters—always temper after hardening.
- Quenching hot metal in water produces steam—keep face clear.
