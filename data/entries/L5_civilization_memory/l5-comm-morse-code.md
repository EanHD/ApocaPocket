summary: Morse code transmits text as sequences of dots (short) and dashes (long) via sound, light, or radio. The most robust long-distance communication method — works through interference that would destroy
  voice. SOS (···−−−···) is universally recognized. Learnable in 2-4 weeks of practice.
warnings:
- SOS (···−−−···) is an international distress signal — using it when not in distress is illegal and dangerous
- Morse via radio requires a transmitting license in most jurisdictions (except in genuine emergencies)
- Learning Morse requires consistent daily practice — 15 minutes/day for 2-4 weeks to reach basic proficiency
steps:
- 'THE ALPHABET: A ·− | B −··· | C −·−· | D −·· | E · | F ··−· | G −−· | H ···· | I ·· | J ·−−− | K −·− | L ·−·· | M −− | N −· | O −−− | P ·−−· | Q −−·− | R ·−· | S ··· | T − | U ··− | V ···− | W ·−− |
  X −··− | Y −·−− | Z −−··'
- 'NUMBERS: 1 ·−−−− | 2 ··−−− | 3 ···−− | 4 ····− | 5 ····· | 6 −···· | 7 −−··· | 8 −−−·· | 9 −−−−· | 0 −−−−−'
- 'TIMING (critical): A dot = 1 unit. A dash = 3 units. Space between parts of a letter = 1 unit. Space between letters = 3 units. Space between words = 7 units. At 5 words per minute (beginner): 1 unit
  ≈ 240ms. At 13 WPM (intermediate): 1 unit ≈ 92ms.'
- 'ESSENTIAL PHRASES: SOS = ···−−−··· (no spaces — run together). CQ = calling any station: −·−· −−·−. DE = this is: −·· ·. K = go ahead: −·−. AR = end of message: ·−·−·. 73 = best regards: −−··· ···−−.'
- 'LEARNING METHOD: do NOT learn by sight (dot-dash patterns). Learn by SOUND. Each letter has a rhythm. E = ''dit''. T = ''dah''. A = ''di-dah''. Use the Koch method: start with just 2 characters (K and
  M) at full speed. Add one new character when you reach 90% accuracy. This builds sound recognition, not visual decoding.'
- 'TRANSMISSION METHODS: (1) SOUND: tap on metal, use a whistle, or key a radio. (2) LIGHT: flashlight, mirror, fire (cover and uncover). (3) VISUAL: flag waving (left for dot, right for dash). (4) RADIO:
  simplest radio mode — just on/off keying of a carrier signal. CW (continuous wave) Morse travels further than voice on the same power.'
- 'IMPROVISED KEY AND OSCILLATOR: for practice, touch two wires to complete a circuit through a buzzer/speaker and battery. For signaling: any interruptible signal source works. A mirror (heliograph) can
  signal Morse code over 20+ miles in clear conditions.'
- 'RECEIVING TIPS: write down each letter as you decode it — don''t try to remember whole words. Use a slash (/) between words. If you miss a character, write a question mark and keep going. Context usually
  fills in gaps.'
- 'COMMON PROCEDURES: call format: CQ CQ CQ DE [your call] [your call] K. Response: [their call] DE [your call] K. Signal report: RST system (Readability 1-5, Strength 1-9, Tone 1-9). Position report: latitude
  and longitude in degrees and minutes.'
- 'EMERGENCY: SOS can be signaled by any means — tapping on a pipe, flashing a light, honking a horn, stamping feet. Three short, three long, three short. Repeat. It is understood worldwide regardless of
  language.'
