## Overview
How loads move through components to foundations, and how failures cascade.

## Step-by-step
1. Define dead/live/environmental loads.
2. Trace continuous load path to ground.
3. Add redundancy and bracing in key spans.
4. Inspect joints and supports regularly.

## Warnings
- Small connection failures can trigger progressive collapse.
- Wind and water loads are often underestimated.
