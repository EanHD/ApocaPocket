## Overview
Minimum conceptual set for machine function, force transfer, and thermal systems.

## Step-by-step
1. Map system boundaries and energy flow.
2. Analyze loads and constraints.
3. Design for maintainability and standardization.
4. Validate with simple test rigs before deployment.

## Warnings
- Ignoring fatigue and stress concentration causes failures.
- Prototype safety controls before full-scale use.
