steps:
- Understand that triangles are inherently rigid—the basis of all trusses.
- 'Design common truss types: king post (simplest), queen post, Howe, Pratt.'
- Calculate member forces using method of joints or method of sections.
- 'Size members: tension members can be thinner; compression members must resist buckling.'
- Connect joints with gusset plates, pegs, bolts, or lashed connections.
warnings:
- A single failed member can cause progressive truss collapse.
- Compression members must be braced against lateral buckling.

## Overview
Using triangulated frameworks to span distances efficiently with minimal material.

## Step-by-step
1. Understand that triangles are inherently rigid—the basis of all trusses.
2. Design common truss types: king post (simplest), queen post, Howe, Pratt.
3. Calculate member forces using method of joints or method of sections.
4. Size members: tension members can be thinner; compression members must resist buckling.
5. Connect joints with gusset plates, pegs, bolts, or lashed connections.

## Warnings
- A single failed member can cause progressive truss collapse.
- Compression members must be braced against lateral buckling.
