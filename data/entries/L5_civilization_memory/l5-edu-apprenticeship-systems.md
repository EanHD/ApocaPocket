summary: Structured apprenticeship programs for transferring critical trade skills
  across generations.
steps:
- Identify critical skills that must be preserved (smithing, medicine, agriculture,
  etc.).
- Pair each master practitioner with 1-3 apprentices.
- 'Structure learning progression: observe → assist → perform under supervision →
  solo.'
- Set milestones and practical tests for advancement.
- Require journeyman apprentices to teach beginners (teaching reinforces learning).
warnings:
- 'Single points of failure: if only one person knows a skill, train backups urgently.'
- Apprenticeships take years—start training before current masters age out.
