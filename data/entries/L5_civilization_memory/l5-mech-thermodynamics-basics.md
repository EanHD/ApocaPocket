summary: Fundamental principles of heat transfer and energy conversion for building
  simple engines and heating systems.
steps:
- 'Understand the three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, radiation.'
- Learn the concept of work from expanding gases (piston principle).
- 'Grasp thermal efficiency: no engine converts all heat to work (second law).'
- Apply insulation principles to reduce unwanted heat loss.
- Design simple steam or hot-air engines using pressure differentials.
warnings:
- Pressurized vessels can explode—always include pressure relief.
- Burns from steam are more severe than from dry heat at the same temperature.

## Overview
Fundamental principles of heat transfer and energy conversion for building simple engines and heating systems.

## Step-by-step
1. Understand the three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, radiation.
2. Learn the concept of work from expanding gases (piston principle).
3. Grasp thermal efficiency: no engine converts all heat to work (second law).
4. Apply insulation principles to reduce unwanted heat loss.
5. Design simple steam or hot-air engines using pressure differentials.

## Warnings
- Pressurized vessels can explode—always include pressure relief.
- Burns from steam are more severe than from dry heat at the same temperature.
