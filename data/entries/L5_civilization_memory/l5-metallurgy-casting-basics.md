summary: Sand casting technique for reproducing metal parts using reusable patterns
  and sand molds.
steps:
- Create a pattern of the desired part from wood or existing object.
- Pack greensand (sand + clay + water) around the pattern in a two-part flask (cope
  and drag).
- Remove the pattern, cut gates and risers for metal flow and air escape.
- Melt metal in a crucible furnace and pour into the mold cavity.
- Allow to cool, break out casting, and finish by filing and grinding.
warnings:
- Molten metal is extremely dangerous—wear full protective gear.
- Moisture in the mold causes steam explosions—dry sand thoroughly.

## Overview
Sand casting technique for reproducing metal parts using reusable patterns and sand molds.

## Step-by-step
1. Create a pattern of the desired part from wood or existing object.
2. Pack greensand (sand + clay + water) around the pattern in a two-part flask (cope and drag).
3. Remove the pattern, cut gates and risers for metal flow and air escape.
4. Melt metal in a crucible furnace and pour into the mold cavity.
5. Allow to cool, break out casting, and finish by filing and grinding.

## Warnings
- Molten metal is extremely dangerous—wear full protective gear.
- Moisture in the mold causes steam explosions—dry sand thoroughly.
