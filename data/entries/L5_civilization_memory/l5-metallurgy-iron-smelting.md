summary: How to produce usable iron from ore using a bloomery furnace with charcoal
  fuel.
steps:
- 'Identify iron ore: look for heavy, reddish-brown rocks (hematite, magnetite, bog
  iron).'
- Build a bloomery furnace from clay/stone, ~1m tall with tuyere (air inlet) near
  base.
- Produce charcoal by slow-burning hardwood in a covered pit.
- Charge furnace with alternating layers of charcoal and crushed ore.
- Maintain forced air (bellows) for 6-10 hours to reach ~1200°C; extract bloom and
  hammer out slag.
warnings:
- Extreme heat and carbon monoxide—work outdoors with ventilation.
- Molten slag causes severe burns; wear protection and keep water away from furnace.

## Overview
How to produce usable iron from ore using a bloomery furnace with charcoal fuel.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify iron ore: look for heavy, reddish-brown rocks (hematite, magnetite, bog iron).
2. Build a bloomery furnace from clay/stone, ~1m tall with tuyere (air inlet) near base.
3. Produce charcoal by slow-burning hardwood in a covered pit.
4. Charge furnace with alternating layers of charcoal and crushed ore.
5. Maintain forced air (bellows) for 6-10 hours to reach ~1200°C; extract bloom and hammer out slag.

## Warnings
- Extreme heat and carbon monoxide—work outdoors with ventilation.
- Molten slag causes severe burns; wear protection and keep water away from furnace.
