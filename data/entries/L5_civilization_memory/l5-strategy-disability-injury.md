summary: 'You broke your leg, lost vision, or have a group member with disability. How do you survive? This entry covers: adapting tasks, mobility aids, psychological adaptation, and group support systems.
  Disability doesn''t mean death — it means different strategies.'
warnings:
- Solo survival with major disability is extremely difficult — injury is a primary reason to stay with a group
- 'Infections are the #1 killer after disabling injuries — wound care becomes your primary focus'
- Depression and giving up kill as surely as injury — maintain purpose and hope
- In groups, resentment toward disabled members can form — address this openly
steps:
- 'BROKEN LEG/IMMOBILIZATION (solo): You cannot walk. Priority: Move to a location with water, shelter materials, and firewood within arm''s reach. Crawl or drag yourself using upper body. Build shelter
  from seated/lying position. Craft crutches (forked branches padded with cloth/moss under armpits, or single staff). Healing time: 6-8 weeks. Keep limb elevated when possible to reduce swelling. Risks:
  infection at break site, atrophy from immobility, pressure sores from lying on one side. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Set micro-goals (today I will improve my crawling shelter by X). Survive one day at a time.'
- 'BROKEN LEG (group): Splint, elevate, rest. Assign the injured person seated tasks: tool making, cordage braiding, food prep, teaching children, keeping watch (if they can see). A person with one working
  leg can still contribute. Craft a crutch or carrying litter for moving camp. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Keep them involved in decisions and work — uselessness breeds despair.'
- 'LOSS OF HAND/ARM: Adapt tasks for one-handed operation. Friction-based tool holding (wedge handle in ground, brace between knees). Build one-handed tools (knife with wrist strap, forked sticks for pinning).
  Fire starting: bow drill can be modified (foot-operated bow). Tasks: scouting, teaching, planning, tool design, child supervision. Many tasks need only one hand. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Relearn everything. It''s
  frustrating. Allow grief. Then adapt.'
- 'BLINDNESS/VISION LOSS: Orientation: memorize camp layout by counting steps, use rope guides between important locations, keep camp organized (everything has a place). Navigation: use a sighted guide
  or constant auditory contact with group. Tasks: cordage making (by feel), food processing (by feel), firewood splitting (use a chopping block, strike by sound), storytelling/education, timekeeping. Touch
  and hearing become primary. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Dependence is terrifying. Assign meaningful work that builds confidence.'
- 'DEAFNESS: Visual communication: agree on hand signals with group. Written notes if literate. Situational awareness is reduced (can''t hear approaching animals, warning shouts). Compensate: high visibility
  camp placement, visual watch system (mirror flashes, flags). Tasks: all physical work, scouting (vision is unaffected). PSYCHOLOGICAL: Isolation in group settings — ensure inclusion in discussions (face
  them, speak clearly for lip-reading if partial hearing, or write).'
- 'CHRONIC ILLNESS (diabetes, heart condition, etc): Without medication, chronic conditions worsen. Adapt diet and activity level. Diabetes: low-carb diet, frequent small meals, avoid blood sugar spikes.
  Heart condition: avoid overexertion, rest frequently, keep tasks light. Group must compensate. These members contribute skills, planning, teaching. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Knowledge is a contribution. If you can''t
  lift logs, teach someone how to build. If you can''t hunt, teach plant identification.'
- 'MOBILITY AIDS (field improvised): CRUTCHES: forked branches, padded tops, height = armpit to ground minus 2 inches. WALKER: tripod of sticks lashed at top, splayed at bottom. WHEELCHAIR: not practical
  in wilderness but can be built with wheels (log sections) on axle for moving camp in flat terrain. LITTER: two poles with cloth/hide slung between = carry injured member. Requires 2-4 people.'
- 'PSYCHOLOGICAL ADAPTATION: (1) Acknowledge loss (grief is normal). (2) Focus on what you CAN do, not what you can''t. (3) Experiment with adaptations (trial and error). (4) Accept help without shame.
  (5) Stay engaged with the group. (6) Teach others your previous skills (knowledge survives the body). (7) If you''re caring for someone: encourage independence where possible, do FOR them only what they
  truly can''t do themselves.'
- 'GROUP DYNAMICS: Disabled members are not dead weight — they''re humans with skills, knowledge, and value. Assign tasks that match ability. Distribute extra work among able-bodied (rotate heavy tasks
  to prevent resentment). Have open conversations about capabilities and limitations. In crisis, make difficult decisions based on group survival, but approach with compassion.'
