summary: Using rivers, ridgelines, and terrain features as natural navigation aids.
steps:
- Rivers flow downhill to larger water bodies—follow downstream to find settlements.
- Use ridgelines for vantage points to identify landmarks and plan routes.
- 'Read terrain: valleys funnel travel, saddles provide passes between peaks.'
- 'Note vegetation patterns: different growth on north vs. south slopes.'
- 'Use terrain association: match surrounding features to map to confirm position.'
warnings:
- Following rivers into gorges or rapids can be dangerous—scout ahead.
- Terrain features can look similar—use multiple landmarks for confirmation.

## Overview
Using rivers, ridgelines, and terrain features as natural navigation aids.

## Step-by-step
1. Rivers flow downhill to larger water bodies—follow downstream to find settlements.
2. Use ridgelines for vantage points to identify landmarks and plan routes.
3. Read terrain: valleys funnel travel, saddles provide passes between peaks.
4. Note vegetation patterns: different growth on north vs. south slopes.
5. Use terrain association: match surrounding features to map to confirm position.

## Warnings
- Following rivers into gorges or rapids can be dangerous—scout ahead.
- Terrain features can look similar—use multiple landmarks for confirmation.
