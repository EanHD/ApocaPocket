steps:
- Find a magnetizable needle, pin, or thin steel wire.
- Magnetize by stroking repeatedly in one direction with a magnet or by induction.
- Float the needle on a small leaf or cork in still water.

## Overview
Building a functional magnetic compass from salvaged materials for direction finding.

## Step-by-step
1. Find a magnetizable needle, pin, or thin steel wire.
2. Magnetize by stroking repeatedly in one direction with a magnet or by induction.
3. Float the needle on a small leaf or cork in still water.
4. The needle aligns north-south; mark the north-seeking end.
5. Calibrate against known landmarks or celestial observations.

## Warnings
- Metal objects and electronics near the compass cause deviation.
- Magnetic north differs from true north—learn local declination.
