summary: Building durable structures from earth-based materials available almost anywhere.
steps:
- 'Test soil: ideal mix is ~70% sand, 30% clay; adjust with additives.'
- 'Adobe: form wet earth-straw mix into bricks, dry in sun for 2-4 weeks.'
- 'Rammed earth: compact damp soil in formwork layers of 10-15 cm.'
- 'Cob: hand-mix earth, sand, straw, and water; build in lifts without forms.'
- Protect all earthen walls with roof overhangs and waterproof foundation courses.
warnings:
- Earthen walls dissolve in prolonged rain without protection.
- Thick walls are needed for structural strength—minimum 30 cm.

## Overview
Building durable structures from earth-based materials available almost anywhere.

## Step-by-step
1. Test soil: ideal mix is ~70% sand, 30% clay; adjust with additives.
2. Adobe: form wet earth-straw mix into bricks, dry in sun for 2-4 weeks.
3. Rammed earth: compact damp soil in formwork layers of 10-15 cm.
4. Cob: hand-mix earth, sand, straw, and water; build in lifts without forms.
5. Protect all earthen walls with roof overhangs and waterproof foundation courses.

## Warnings
- Earthen walls dissolve in prolonged rain without protection.
- Thick walls are needed for structural strength—minimum 30 cm.
