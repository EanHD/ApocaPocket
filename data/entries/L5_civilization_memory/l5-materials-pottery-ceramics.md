# Pottery & Ceramics
**Level 5: Materials & Manufacturing**

## Why This Matters
Pottery is one of humanity's oldest technologies (10,000+ years) and a **civilization multiplier**. Without ceramics, you cannot:
- Store food long-term (waterproof vessels)
- Transport/store liquids safely
- Cook efficiently (heat-resistant cookware)
- Build durable structures (bricks, tiles, pipes)
- Create advanced technology (crucibles for metallurgy, insulators)

**One potter can supply an entire village with containers.** This frees people from constant food gathering.

## Clay Identification

### Finding Clay
**Best locations:**
- Riverbanks and streambeds (deposited sediment)
- Hillsides after erosion
- Areas where water pools and soil is sticky
- Lake shores, especially dried lakebeds
- Below topsoil (12-36 inches down)

### Plasticity Test (Field Test)
1. **Roll test**: Roll a small ball between palms, then roll into a "snake" 1/4 inch diameter
   - ✓ Good clay: Bends without cracking
   - ❌ Poor clay: Crumbles or breaks
2. **Coil test**: Wrap the snake around your finger
   - ✓ Good clay: Smooth bend, no cracks
   - ❌ Poor clay: Breaks apart
3. **Ribbon test**: Roll flat and thin
   - ✓ Good clay: Holds shape, some flexibility
   - ❌ Poor clay: Falls apart immediately

### Clay Colors & Properties
- **Red clay**: High iron content, fires to terracotta (earthenware)
- **White/gray clay**: Kaolin, fires to porcelain (high temperature)
- **Brown/tan clay**: Mixed content, general purpose
- **Blue/black clay**: Organic matter, needs processing

---

## Clay Preparation

### 1. Cleaning
- Remove rocks, roots, organic matter
- Break into small chunks (fist-sized)
- Soak in water 24-48 hours until slurry forms

### 2. Slaking & Sieving
- Stir water-clay mixture thoroughly
- Let heavy particles settle (2-4 hours)
- Pour off top layer (fine clay particles)
- Strain through cloth or screen (1/8 inch mesh)
- Let water evaporate until workable consistency

### 3. Wedging (Critical Step)
**Purpose**: Remove air bubbles (cause explosions in kiln)

**Technique**:
1. Cut clay mass in half with wire
2. Slam one half onto the other
3. Knead like bread dough (press, fold, rotate)
4. Repeat 50-100 times (15-20 minutes)
5. Final clay should be uniform, no air pockets
6. Test: Cut with wire, surface should be smooth with no holes

### 4. Temper/Grog (Reduces Cracking)
**Add 10-30% by volume:**
- **Grog**: Pre-fired clay, crushed to sand-like consistency
- **Sand**: Clean, angular grains (not beach sand—too round)
- **Crushed fired pottery**: Best for beginners
- **Organic temper** (straw, grass): Burns out during firing, creates porous ware

**Mix thoroughly** by wedging temper into clay.

## Building Techniques

### 1. Pinch Method
**Best for**: Small bowls, cups
- Start with ball of clay (fist-sized)
- Press thumb into center, leave 1/4-1/2 inch base
- Rotate and pinch walls upward, keeping even thickness
- Target wall thickness: 1/4 to 3/8 inch

### 2. Coil Method
**Best for**: Large vessels, storage jars
1. Roll clay into "snakes" (1/2 to 1 inch diameter)
2. Lay first coil in spiral for base, blend seams
3. Stack coils on edge, spiraling upward
4. Blend each coil into the one below (inside and outside)
5. Smooth with fingers, ribs, or scrapers
6. Keep coils uniform thickness

### 3. Slab Method
**Best for**: Flat items, boxes, tiles
1. Roll clay flat with rolling pin or cylinder
2. Use guide sticks (1/4 to 1/2 inch) for even thickness
3. Cut shapes with knife
4. Join edges by scoring and slip (clay + water paste)
5. Press firmly, smooth joints

### 4. Wheel Throwing (If Available)
**Requires**: Potter's wheel (foot-powered or electric)
- Center clay on wheel (hardest skill)
- Open center with thumbs while spinning
- Pull walls upward with steady pressure
- Keep hands wet, move slowly
- **Mastery takes months of practice**

## Drying (Critical: Prevents Cracking)

### Stage 1: Leather-Hard (12-24 hours)
- Clay is firm but can be carved/trimmed
- Joins can still be made with slip
- Cover with plastic to slow drying

### Stage 2: Bone-Dry (1-3 days total)
- Clay is completely dry, lighter in color
- Very fragile (handle carefully)
- No moisture should remain before firing

### Common Mistakes
❌ **Too fast drying** → surface cracks
- ✓ **Solution**: Cover with damp cloth, dry slowly in shade

❌ **Uneven thickness** → stress cracks
- ✓ **Solution**: Keep walls uniform (1/4 to 3/8 inch)

❌ **Trapped air** → explosions in kiln
- ✓ **Solution**: Wedge thoroughly, poke holes for thick pieces

## Kiln Construction

### Pit Kiln (Easiest)
**Materials**: Firewood, dry grass/dung for slow burn
1. Dig pit 2-3 feet deep, 3 feet wide
2. Build fire, let burn to coals
3. Place pottery on bed of ash/sand
4. Cover with broken pottery shards (heat diffusion)
5. Cover with sheet metal or clay lid
6. Seal edges with dirt
7. Burn 4-8 hours (slow, even heat)
8. **Temperature**: 1000-1400°F (low-fire earthenware)

### Updraft Kiln (Better Control)
**Materials**: Clay bricks or stone, clay mortar

**Structure**:
- **Firebox**: Bottom chamber, burn wood/charcoal
- **Kiln chamber**: Middle, hold pottery on shelves
- **Chimney**: Top, exhaust vent (6-12 inches diameter)

**Dimensions** (small kiln):
- Height: 3-4 feet
- Width: 2-3 feet diameter
- Wall thickness: 6-8 inches (insulation)

**Airflow**: Fire heats air → rises through pottery → exits chimney

### Downdraft Kiln (Highest Efficiency)
- Fire at top or sides
- Heat forced down through pottery, then up through flue
- More even temperature distribution
- **Temperature**: 1800-2300°F (stoneware, glazed ware)

**Construction**: Similar to updraft but with baffle walls to redirect flame path

## Firing Process

### Bisque Firing (First Firing)
**Temperature**: 1000-1650°F
**Duration**: 6-12 hours
**Purpose**: Harden clay, prepare for glazing

**Process**:
1. Load bone-dry pottery into kiln (do not stack tightly)
2. Build fire slowly (200°F per hour increase)
3. **Critical**: Heat gradually for first 2 hours (steam must escape)
4. Maintain peak temperature 1-2 hours
5. Let cool naturally (12-24 hours) — **DO NOT OPEN EARLY**

### Glaze Firing (Second Firing)
**Temperature**: 1800-2300°F (depending on glaze)
**Duration**: 8-14 hours
**Purpose**: Melt glaze into glass-like waterproof coating

### Temperature Indicators (Without Pyrometer)
- **1000°F**: Dull red glow (visible in darkness)
- **1400°F**: Cherry red (visible in dim light)
- **1800°F**: Bright orange
- **2000°F**: Yellow-orange
- **2300°F**: Yellow-white

## Glazing

### Natural Glaze Materials

**Wood Ash Glaze** (Easiest):
- Collect hardwood ash (oak, maple)
- Sift through fine screen
- Mix 80% ash + 20% clay
- Add water to cream consistency
- **Fires at**: 2000-2300°F

**Mineral Glazes**:
- **Silica** (sand, quartz): Glass-former (main ingredient)
- **Feldspar**: Melts silica at lower temperature
- **Limestone/marble**: Calcium source, improves durability
- **Iron oxide**: Red/brown color (rust, ochre)
- **Copper oxide**: Green/blue color (malachite)

**Basic Formula**:
- Silica: 40-50%
- Feldspar: 25-35%
- Limestone: 10-15%
- Clay: 10-15%

### Application
1. **Bisque-fired pottery** must be clean, dust-free
2. **Dip method**: Submerge 2-3 seconds
3. **Brush method**: Apply 2-3 even coats
4. **Pour method**: For interiors
5. **Thickness**: 1/16 inch (too thin = bare spots, too thick = runs)
6. **Wipe base clean** (glaze on bottom = stuck to kiln shelf)

## Safety Warnings

⚠️ **Kiln operation**:
- Extreme heat (1000-2300°F) causes severe burns
- Wear leather gloves, long sleeves
- Never look directly into bright kiln (eye damage)
- Carbon monoxide risk in enclosed spaces (ventilate)

⚠️ **Silica dust**: Inhaling dry clay dust causes silicosis (lung disease)
- Keep clay wet when working
- Wear mask when sanding dry pottery
- Clean with wet mop, not sweeping

⚠️ **Explosions**: Moisture or air in clay → steam explosion
- Wedge thoroughly to remove air
- Dry completely before firing
- Heat slowly (first 2 hours critical)

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Cracks during drying | Too fast, uneven thickness | Dry slowly under plastic, even walls |
| Explosions in kiln | Trapped air or moisture | Wedge thoroughly, bone-dry before firing |
| Warping | Uneven heating | Stack evenly, gradual temperature rise |
| Glaze doesn't melt | Temperature too low | Fire hotter, adjust glaze formula |
| Glaze runs off | Too thick, too high temp | Thinner application, lower temp |
| Pottery absorbs water | Under-fired | Fire to higher temperature |

## Historical Context

**10,000 BCE**: First pottery in East Asia (Jomon culture, Japan)
**8000 BCE**: Middle East pottery (Fertile Crescent)
**5000 BCE**: Potter's wheel invented (Mesopotamia)
**3000 BCE**: High-fired glazed ceramics (Egypt)

**Why it enabled civilization**:
- Food surplus (storage vessels → can save grain for winter)
- Sanitation (pipes for water, waste removal)
- Trade (standardized containers for oil, wine, grain)
- Technology (crucibles enabled bronze → iron ages)

**One skilled potter can produce 20-50 vessels per week**, supplying hundreds of people with essential containers. This allows others to specialize in farming, hunting, building—the foundation of complex society.
