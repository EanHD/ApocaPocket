summary: You survived the first day. Now what? This entry provides milestone goals for Day 1, Week 1, Month 1, and Year 1. Each phase has different priorities. This roadmap turns survival into sustainable
  living, then into rebuilding.
warnings:
- Do not skip phases — attempting Year 1 goals (farming) on Day 3 wastes energy and resources
- Group dynamics change priorities — more people = faster progress but also more conflict and resource needs
- Winter is the great filter — if you haven't prepared food/fuel/shelter by late fall, you will not survive winter
- Psychological collapse kills thriving settlements — boredom, hopelessness, and interpersonal conflict must be managed
steps:
- 'DAY 1 — SURVIVAL TRIAGE: Immediate threats handled. You have: shelter (minimum viable), fire (or plan for it), water identified, no active injuries. Mental state: shock, adrenaline. Goal: Make it through
  the first night without injury or exposure. Celebrate this — you''re alive.'
- 'DAY 2-7 — STABILIZATION PHASE: Improve shelter (weatherproof, insulated). Secure reliable water (collection, purification). Establish fire routine (gather enough fuel for 24 hours ahead). Begin food
  assessment (don''t hunt yet — observe animal patterns, identify plants, set passive traps). Mental state: exhaustion, fear. Goal: Routine. Same tasks every day build confidence.'
- 'WEEK 2-4 — SUSTAINABILITY BASICS: Shelter is solid and dry. Water is routine. Fire is easy. Food: 1-2 reliable sources (fish trap, small game snares, abundant edible plants). Begin preserving food (drying,
  smoking). Create tools (knife, cordage, containers). Mental state: cautious optimism or deepening despair (depends on success). Goal: Reduce daily energy expenditure — make tasks easier with better tools
  and systems.'
- 'MONTH 2-3 — RESOURCE MAPPING: You know your area. Map water sources, food zones, shelter materials, hazards. Expand range carefully. Begin seasonal prep (if fall: gather/dry food and firewood aggressively
  for winter; if spring: prepare garden site). Build backup shelter or improve main shelter to permanent. Mental state: acceptance. This is life now. Goal: Resilience. You can handle bad weather, injury,
  or failed hunt.'
- 'MONTH 4-6 — THRIVING TRANSITION: Surplus food stored. Shelter is comfortable. You have clothing/footwear (made or improvised). Skills are improving (fire in any condition, identify 20+ edible plants,
  successfully hunt/trap small game). If alone: consider long-term loneliness strategy (journaling, projects, goals). If group: establish roles and governance. Goal: Quality of life improvements — soap,
  comfortable bed, varied diet, hygiene.'
- 'MONTH 7-12 — BUILDING FOUNDATIONS: Permanent shelter (cabin, stone structure). Food production begins (garden, aquaponics, small livestock if possible). Tool workshop (forge, workshop, dedicated areas).
  Preservation infrastructure (root cellar, smokehouse, drying racks). If group: education system for children, skill-sharing, cultural activities (music, stories, games). Mental state: cautiously hopeful
  or grinding through hard seasons. Goal: Survive the first full seasonal cycle. If you make it to Day 365, you''ve learned what works.'
- 'YEAR 2-5 — SUSTAINABLE HOMESTEAD: Food production covers 70%+ of calories (farming, animals, foraging fills gaps). Infrastructure: water system, waste management, energy (wood, water power, wind). Skills:
  metalworking, textiles, medicine, construction. If group: governance structure, trade networks with other groups, cultural preservation (records, teaching, rituals). Goal: Reduce reliance on salvage/wild
  resources. Become regenerative.'
- 'YEAR 6-20 — CIVILIZATION REBOOT: Multi-household community or established homestead passing to next generation. Education system teaching literacy, math, sciences, trades. Surplus supports specialization
  (blacksmith, healer, teacher). Infrastructure: mills, bridges, irrigation. Cultural memory preserved (library, oral traditions, apprenticeships). Goal: The knowledge doesn''t die with you.'
- 'PSYCHOLOGICAL MILESTONES: Day 1 = survive. Week 1 = routine. Month 1 = hope. Month 6 = acceptance. Year 1 = competence. Year 5 = legacy planning. Mental health is a survival skill. Celebrate milestones.
  Create meaning. Help others. These are not luxuries — they''re what keep you human.'
