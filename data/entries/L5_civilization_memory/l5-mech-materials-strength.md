summary: Understanding how materials respond to loads, and how to apply safety factors
  to prevent failure.
steps:
- Define stress (force/area) and strain (deformation/original length).
- Identify yield strength (permanent deformation begins) vs. ultimate strength (failure).
- 'Apply safety factors: design load = ultimate strength / safety factor (typically
  2-4 for critical structures).'
- 'Recognize failure modes: tension, compression, shear, buckling, fatigue.'
- Test materials empirically when data is unavailable—load incrementally and observe.
warnings:
- Fatigue failure occurs below yield strength after many load cycles.
- Notches and holes concentrate stress—round all corners.

## Overview
Understanding how materials respond to loads, and how to apply safety factors to prevent failure.

## Step-by-step
1. Define stress (force/area) and strain (deformation/original length).
2. Identify yield strength (permanent deformation begins) vs. ultimate strength (failure).
3. Apply safety factors: design load = ultimate strength / safety factor (typically 2-4 for critical structures).
4. Recognize failure modes: tension, compression, shear, buckling, fatigue.
5. Test materials empirically when data is unavailable—load incrementally and observe.

## Warnings
- Fatigue failure occurs below yield strength after many load cycles.
- Notches and holes concentrate stress—round all corners.
