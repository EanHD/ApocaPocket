summary: Sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for calculating angles, heights, and distances
  in construction and surveying.
steps:
- 'Learn the three primary trig ratios: sin = opposite/hypotenuse, cos = adjacent/hypotenuse,
  tan = opposite/adjacent.'
- 'Memorize key angle values: 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° and their ratios.'
- Apply tangent to measure heights of structures or trees using shadow length.
- Use sine rule and cosine rule for non-right triangles in land surveying.
- 'Practice triangulation: measure one baseline and two angles to find unknown distances.'
warnings:
- Small angle measurement errors multiply over distance.
- Always verify with a second method when possible.

## Overview
Sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for calculating angles, heights, and distances in construction and surveying.

## Step-by-step
1. Learn the three primary trig ratios: sin = opposite/hypotenuse, cos = adjacent/hypotenuse, tan = opposite/adjacent.
2. Memorize key angle values: 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° and their ratios.
3. Apply tangent to measure heights of structures or trees using shadow length.
4. Use sine rule and cosine rule for non-right triangles in land surveying.
5. Practice triangulation: measure one baseline and two angles to find unknown distances.

## Warnings
- Small angle measurement errors multiply over distance.
- Always verify with a second method when possible.
