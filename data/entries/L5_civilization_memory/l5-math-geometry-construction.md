summary: Compass-and-straightedge methods for laying out perpendicular lines, bisecting
  angles, and constructing regular shapes.
steps:
- 'Construct a perpendicular bisector: arc from each endpoint, connect intersections.'
- Bisect any angle with equal arcs from the vertex, then arc from each intersection.
- Construct a right angle using a 3-4-5 triangle with rope or stakes.
- Lay out a square foundation by constructing perpendiculars at corners.
- Create regular polygons (hexagon, octagon) inscribed in circles for structural layouts.
warnings:
- Use taut string or rigid straightedge—sagging introduces error.
- Mark points clearly; lost reference marks require starting over.

## Overview
Compass-and-straightedge methods for laying out perpendicular lines, bisecting angles, and constructing regular shapes.

## Step-by-step
1. Construct a perpendicular bisector: arc from each endpoint, connect intersections.
2. Bisect any angle with equal arcs from the vertex, then arc from each intersection.
3. Construct a right angle using a 3-4-5 triangle with rope or stakes.
4. Lay out a square foundation by constructing perpendiculars at corners.
5. Create regular polygons (hexagon, octagon) inscribed in circles for structural layouts.

## Warnings
- Use taut string or rigid straightedge—sagging introduces error.
- Mark points clearly; lost reference marks require starting over.
