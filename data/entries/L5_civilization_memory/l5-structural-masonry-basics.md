summary: Building durable walls from brick or stone with proper bonding patterns and
  mortar.
steps:
- 'Select materials: fired brick, stone, or concrete block; lime or clay mortar.'
- Lay courses with staggered joints (running bond) to distribute loads.
- Use a level and plumb line to keep walls vertical and courses horizontal.
- Build corners first, then fill between using string lines for alignment.
- Include lintels over openings (stone, timber, or steel) to carry wall loads.
warnings:
- Unreinforced masonry is weak in earthquakes—add buttresses or reinforcement.
- Mortar must cure slowly—keep damp for several days.

## Overview
Building durable walls from brick or stone with proper bonding patterns and mortar.

## Step-by-step
1. Select materials: fired brick, stone, or concrete block; lime or clay mortar.
2. Lay courses with staggered joints (running bond) to distribute loads.
3. Use a level and plumb line to keep walls vertical and courses horizontal.
4. Build corners first, then fill between using string lines for alignment.
5. Include lintels over openings (stone, timber, or steel) to carry wall loads.
