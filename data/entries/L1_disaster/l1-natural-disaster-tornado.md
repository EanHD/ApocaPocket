# Tornado Survival Protocols

## Overview
Tornadoes can destroy structures in seconds. Survival depends on **immediate shelter positioning**.

## Watch vs Warning
- **Watch**: conditions possible; prepare now.
- **Warning**: tornado indicated/observed; shelter immediately.

## Best Shelter Hierarchy
1. Purpose-built storm shelter/safe room.
2. Basement interior corner, away from windows.
3. Small interior room on lowest floor (bathroom/closet).
4. Last resort: low ditch (if no sturdy structure).

## Mobile Homes
Mobile homes are high-risk in tornadoes. Relocate to sturdy shelter when watch is issued.

## In Vehicle
- Do not try to outrun a nearby tornado in congested/uncertain routes.
- If no sturdy shelter: abandon vehicle and seek low ground, protect head/neck.

## Protective Position
- Crouch low.
- Cover head/neck with arms, mattress, helmet, or sturdy padding.
- Keep shoes on (post-event debris hazards).

## After Passage
- Watch for secondary hazards: gas leaks, downed lines, unstable debris.
- Triage injuries and control severe bleeding first.
- Use text-based comms if networks are congested.

## Common Mistakes
- Waiting to visually confirm tornado.
- Taking shelter near windows.
- Seeking overpass shelter (wind tunnel effect risk).

## Summary
Tornado survival is mostly a shelter positioning problem. Move early, go low, protect head/neck.
