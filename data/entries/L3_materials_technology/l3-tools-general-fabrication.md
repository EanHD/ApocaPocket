# General Fabrication: Making Custom Tools and Solutions

## Why This Matters
**Store-bought tools break. Supply chains fail. Knowledge of fabrication = infinite tools.**

In survival scenarios:
- No hardware store, no online ordering
- Must make what you need from what you have
- Custom solutions often better than generic tools
- Repair requires fabrication skills

**Core principle:** With the right knowledge, anything can be made. Not perfectly, but functionally.

## Materials Assessment

### Know What You Have

**First question:** What materials are available?
**Second question:** What are their properties?

### Common Materials and Properties

#### Wood
**Properties:**
- Light, strong in compression (vertical loads)
- Easy to work (saw, carve, drill)
- Abundant (forests, debris, furniture)
- Burns (fuel, but also a risk)

**Best for:**
- Handles (tools, weapons)
- Frames (structures, furniture)
- Leverage (prying, lifting)

**Types:**
- **Hardwood** (oak, maple, ash): Dense, strong, durable (tool handles, striking tools)
- **Softwood** (pine, fir, cedar): Lighter, easier to work, less durable (construction, fire)
- **Green wood** (freshly cut): Flexible, workable, shrinks as dries (bending, carving)
- **Seasoned wood** (dried): Stable, harder, doesn't warp (precision work, long-term projects)

**Weaknesses:**
- Rots in moisture (seal/treat for longevity)
- Splits along grain (pre-drill holes, avoid cross-grain stress)
- Burns (don't use near fire)

#### Metal
**Properties:**
- Very strong (tension and compression)
- Durable (doesn't rot)
- Hard to work (requires tools, heat)
- Heavy

**Best for:**
- Cutting edges (knives, axes, saws)
- Fasteners (nails, screws, wire)
- Structural reinforcement (brackets, hinges)

**Types:**
- **Steel:** Strong, rust-prone, can be sharpened (tools, weapons)
- **Aluminum:** Light, soft, doesn't rust (containers, lightweight frames)
- **Copper:** Malleable, conducts heat, antimicrobial (water pipes, cooking)
- **Brass:** Soft, doesn't spark, corrosion-resistant (fittings, fire-safe tools)

**Working metal:**
- **Cold:** Cutting (hacksaw, file), bending (vice, leverage)
- **Hot:** Forging (hammer + anvil + heat), casting (melt + mold)

**Weaknesses:**
- Rust (oil or paint to prevent)
- Heavy (limits portability)
- Hard to work (requires specialized tools)

#### Plastic
**Properties:**
- Lightweight, waterproof
- Moldable with heat
- Chemically resistant
- Degrades in UV (sun makes brittle)

**Best for:**
- Containers (waterproof, lightweight)
- Fasteners (zip ties, cordage)
- Insulation (thermal, electrical)

**Types:**
- **PET** (bottles): Clear, rigid, heat-moldable
- **HDPE** (milk jugs, buckets): Opaque, flexible, durable
- **PVC** (pipes): Rigid, strong, workable
- **Polypropylene** (rope, containers): Flexible, fatigue-resistant

**Working plastic:**
- Heat (blow dryer, hot water, fire) → mold while soft
- Cut (saw, knife, scissors)
- Join (heat-weld, adhesive, mechanical fasteners)

**Weaknesses:**
- UV degrades (keep out of sun or paint)
- Melts (not heat-resistant)
- Can leach chemicals (not for all food/water applications)

#### Cordage (Rope, Twine, Wire)
**Properties:**
- Flexible, strong in tension (pulling)
- Versatile (binds, lifts, secures)
- Weak in compression (doesn't push)

**Best for:**
- Lashing (bind poles, frames)
- Lifting (pulleys, levers)
- Securing (tie down, bundle)

**Types:**
- **Natural fiber** (hemp, jute, cotton): Rots, medium strength, comfortable
- **Synthetic** (nylon, polyester): Strong, UV/rot resistant, slippery
- **Wire** (steel, copper): Very strong, doesn't stretch, hard to tie

**Weaknesses:**
- Abrasion (wears over time, check regularly)
- UV damage (synthetic degrades in sun)
- Knots weaken (50-70% strength at knot)

#### Adhesives
**Properties:**
- Join materials permanently (or semi-permanently)
- No fasteners needed (cleaner, lighter)
- Requires curing time (patience)

**Types:**
- **Wood glue** (PVA): Strong on wood, not waterproof (interior use)
- **Epoxy:** Very strong, waterproof, bonds most materials (2-part mix, expensive)
- **Super glue** (cyanoacrylate): Fast, strong on small parts, brittle (not impact-resistant)
- **Hot glue:** Fast, flexible, weak (temporary fixes)
- **Natural glue** (hide glue, pitch, flour paste): Traditional, renewable, variable strength

**Best for:**
- Permanent bonds (when disassembly not needed)
- Sealing (waterproofing)
- Reinforcing (in combination with mechanical fasteners)

### Scavenging Strategy
**In survival scenarios, materials come from:**
- **Nature:** Wood (trees), stone (rocks), plant fibers (cordage)
- **Debris:** Buildings (wood, metal, fasteners), vehicles (metal, rubber, glass)
- **Repurposing:** Broken tools (metal parts), packaging (plastic, cardboard), clothing (fabric, cordage)

**Key:** Don't see trash. See materials. Every object is potential raw material.

## Design Process

### 1. Define the Problem
**What do you need?** Be specific.

**Vague:** "I need a tool"
**Specific:** "I need to pry apart wooden boards without breaking them"

**Questions:**
- What is the task?
- What forces/motions are involved?
- What are the constraints? (size, weight, durability)
- How often will it be used?

### 2. Sketch It
**Get it out of your head and onto paper.**

**Multiple views:**
- Side view
- Top view
- Front view
- Detail views (complicated parts)

**Include:**
- Dimensions (approximate, refine later)
- Materials (label what each part is made from)
- Assembly (how parts connect)

**Why sketch:** 
- Clarifies thinking (what seemed clear in your head often isn't)
- Identify problems early (before wasting materials)
- Communication (show others, get feedback)

### 3. Prototype
**Build a rough version first. Not final. Not pretty. Functional.**

**Goals:**
- Test concept (does it work at all?)
- Find problems (what breaks? what's awkward?)
- Refine dimensions (too long? too short? too thick?)

**Materials for prototype:**
- Cheap (scrap, abundant)
- Easy to work (soft wood, cardboard, wire)
- Temporary (you'll throw this away)

**Attitude:** Expect failure. Learn from it. Iterate.

### 4. Test
**Use it. Hard. Break it (or try to).**

**Questions:**
- Does it do the job?
- How long does it last?
- What fails first?
- What's awkward to use?
- What's unsafe?

**Tests:**
- **Functional test:** Does it work as intended?
- **Load test:** Can it handle expected stress? (add weight, pull hard, etc.)
- **Fatigue test:** What about repeated use? (50 reps, 100 reps)
- **Environmental test:** How does weather affect it? (wet, dry, hot, cold)

### 5. Iterate
**Improve. Repeat. Refine.**

**Common improvements:**
- **Strengthen weak points:** Add material, change design, reinforce
- **Reduce weight:** Remove unnecessary material (lighter = easier to use)
- **Improve ergonomics:** Adjust handle angle, grip size, balance
- **Simplify:** Fewer parts = faster to make, less to break

**When to stop iterating:** 
- It works reliably
- Further improvement has diminishing returns
- Good enough for the task

**Document final version:** Measurements, materials, process (so you can make another)

## Tool Selection

### Match Tool to Material

**Wood:**
- **Cutting:** Saw (cross-grain), knife/chisel (with-grain)
- **Shaping:** Axe/hatchet (rough), knife (fine), file/rasp (smoothing)
- **Joining:** Nails, screws, glue, joinery (mortise-tenon, dovetail)
- **Finishing:** Sandpaper, scraper, oil/wax

**Metal:**
- **Cutting:** Hacksaw (straight cuts), file (shaping)
- **Shaping:** File (cold), hammer+anvil (hot), grinder (if available)
- **Joining:** Screws, bolts, rivets, welding (if equipment)
- **Finishing:** File, sandpaper, polishing compound

**Plastic:**
- **Cutting:** Saw (fine-tooth), knife, scissors
- **Shaping:** Heat + mold (hot air, water bath), file/sandpaper
- **Joining:** Heat welding, adhesive, mechanical fasteners
- **Finishing:** Sandpaper (smooth edges), flame-polish (if careful)

**Stone:**
- **Cutting:** Chisel + hammer, saw (masonry blade)
- **Shaping:** Hammer (break), file/grinder (smooth)
- **Joining:** Mortar, fit tightly (dry-stack)
- **Finishing:** Grind smooth, polish (if desired)

### Tool Substitutions (When You Don't Have the "Right" Tool)

**Need a saw, don't have one:**
- Use knife (score deep, snap along line)
- Use wire (friction cutting, slow but works)
- Use sharp stone (abrasion cutting)

**Need a drill, don't have one:**
- Heat + poke (hot metal rod, burn through wood)
- Twist + pressure (sharp point, cordage, bow-drill motion)
- Chisel + hammer (square hole, then round with file)

**Need a clamp, don't have one:**
- Cordage + stick (tourniquet-style twist)
- Weight (rocks, sandbags)
- Wedges (drive into tight space, creates pressure)

**Key:** Function matters more than form. Improvise.

## Measurement and Marking

### Why Accuracy Matters
**Measure twice, cut once. (Or measure once, waste materials.)**

**Small errors compound:**
- 1/4" off on 4 pieces = 1" total error (doesn't fit)
- Angle slightly wrong = gaps, instability
- Hole misaligned = can't assemble

**Critical dimensions:** Get these right or it fails
**Non-critical dimensions:** Close enough is fine

### Measurement Tools

**Ruler/Tape Measure:**
- Mark dimensions directly
- Transfer measurements to material
- Check squareness (measure diagonals, should be equal)

**DIY ruler:** 
- Mark stick at regular intervals (inches, cm, or arbitrary units)
- Keep reference stick (all measurements relative to it)

**Square (right angle):**
- Check corners (90°)
- Mark perpendicular lines

**DIY square:** 
- 3-4-5 triangle (3 units one side, 4 units other, 5 units diagonal = 90° corner)

**Level:**
- Check horizontal (bubble in center)
- Check vertical (bubble centered in other vial)

**DIY level:**
- Water in clear tube (water surface = horizontal)
- Plumb bob (string + weight = vertical)

**Compass (for circles):**
- Draw circles (cut round parts)
- Transfer distance (mark equal lengths)

**DIY compass:**
- String + pencil + pin (anchor pin, stretch string, draw)

### Marking Techniques

**Pencil:**
- Erasable, visible on most materials
- Sharpened = precise line

**Knife/Scribe:**
- Permanent, precise (better than pencil on metal)
- Cuts surface slightly (guide for saw/file)

**Chalk:**
- Visible on dark/rough surfaces
- Temporary (wipes off)

**Best practice:**
- Mark cutting line clearly
- Mark waste side (X on the part you're removing)
- Double-check before cutting (waste = wasted)

## Joining Methods

### Mechanical Fasteners

#### Nails
**How:** Drive through one piece into another

**Best for:**
- Quick assembly
- Wood to wood
- Non-critical loads (not high stress)

**Technique:**
- Pre-drill (prevents splitting, especially near edges)
- Angle slightly (increases grip)
- Clench (bend over on back side for more strength)

**Weakness:** Pulls out under tension (screw better for that)

#### Screws
**How:** Thread bites into material, stronger than nail

**Best for:**
- Permanent assembly
- High loads
- Disassembly (can remove and reuse)

**Technique:**
- Pre-drill pilot hole (2/3 diameter of screw)
- Countersink (if flush surface desired)
- Don't over-tighten (strips threads, splits wood)

**Types:**
- **Wood screws:** Sharp point, aggressive thread (for wood)
- **Machine screws:** Blunt end, fine thread (with nut or threaded hole)
- **Self-tapping:** Cuts own threads (metal, plastic)

#### Bolts and Nuts
**How:** Bolt passes through, nut tightens on other side

**Best for:**
- High loads
- Needs disassembly
- Metal to metal, or wood to wood (with washers)

**Technique:**
- Washer under nut (distributes load, prevents sinking)
- Tighten evenly (alternate sides if multiple bolts)
- Lock nut or split pin (prevents loosening from vibration)

### Cordage/Lashing

**How:** Wrap tightly, bind parts together

**Best for:**
- Poles (frames, tripods, racks)
- Temporary assemblies
- No fasteners available

**Lashing types:**
- **Square lashing:** Two poles at right angle (frames)
- **Diagonal lashing:** Two poles at 45° (bracing)
- **Shear lashing:** Two poles parallel (tripod legs)

**Technique:**
- Start with clove hitch
- Wrap tightly (6-8 turns)
- Frapping turns (wrap between poles, tightens)
- Finish with clove hitch

**Weakness:** Loosens over time (check and re-tighten), not for high precision

### Joinery (Wood)

**How:** Cut interlocking shapes, fit together (no fasteners)

**Best for:**
- Furniture (strong, clean-looking)
- Long-term projects (durable)
- Precision work

**Common joints:**
- **Mortise and tenon:** Hole in one piece, stub on other (very strong)
- **Lap joint:** Notch both pieces, overlap (moderate strength, simple)
- **Dovetail:** Interlocking wedge shapes (resists pulling apart)
- **Butt joint:** Simplest (end to end), weakest (needs reinforcement)

**Technique:**
- Precise measurement (tight fit = strong joint)
- Sharp tools (clean cuts)
- Test fit (dry assemble before gluing)
- Glue + clamp (reinforces joint)

### Adhesives

**When to use:**
- Permanent bond
- Smooth surface (no mechanical fasteners showing)
- Reinforcement (with fasteners)

**Application:**
- Clean surfaces (dirt/oil prevents bond)
- Thin even layer (too much = weak bond)
- Clamp while curing (pressure = stronger bond)
- Allow full cure time (don't stress before ready)

**Limitations:**
- Curing time (not instant, plan ahead)
- Temperature sensitive (cold = slow cure, heat = fast cure)
- Material specific (not all glues work on all materials)

## Prototyping

### Build Rough, Test, Refine

**Prototype goals:**
- Proof of concept (does this idea work?)
- Find flaws (before committing good materials)
- Refine dimensions (what's too big/small/weak?)

### Cardboard Prototyping
**For 3D shapes, mechanisms, fit-testing:**

**Advantages:**
- Fast (cut with scissors/knife)
- Cheap (abundant, free)
- Easy to modify (tape, glue)

**Process:**
1. Cut flat pattern (like paper model)
2. Fold/assemble (tape together)
3. Test fit (does it work?)
4. Adjust (cut, add, reshape)
5. Transfer final dimensions to real materials

**Example:** Design a box, basket, sheath, or holder

### Mockups
**For tools, handles, ergonomics:**

**Advantages:**
- Feel it in your hand (comfort, balance)
- Test motion (does it work smoothly?)
- Identify issues (awkward angle, wrong length)

**Materials:**
- Wood scrap (quick carving)
- Foam (easy shaping)
- Cardboard + tape (3D forms)

**Process:**
1. Rough shape (approximate size)
2. Hold and pretend to use (awkward? comfortable?)
3. Mark adjustments (shorter, longer, different angle)
4. Refine and re-test

## Finishing

### Why Finish?

**Protection:**
- Seal against moisture (prevents rot, rust)
- Protect from UV (prevents cracking, fading)
- Prevent wear (surface harder to damage)

**Aesthetics:**
- Smooth (comfortable to handle)
- Clean (professional appearance)
- Attractive (take pride in your work)

### Wood Finishing

**Sanding:**
- Start coarse (80-grit), remove tool marks
- Progress finer (120, 220-grit), smooth surface
- Sand with grain (not against, causes scratches)

**Sealing:**
- **Oil** (linseed, tung, mineral): Penetrates, waterproofs, easy to apply (wipe on)
- **Wax** (beeswax, paste wax): Surface protection, smooth feel, needs reapplication
- **Varnish** (if available): Hard durable coat, waterproof, longer-lasting
- **Natural alternatives:** Animal fat (temporary), pine pitch (waterproof, sticky)

**Process:**
1. Sand smooth
2. Remove dust (brush, cloth)
3. Apply finish (thin coats better than thick)
4. Allow to dry fully
5. Repeat (2-3 coats typical)

### Metal Finishing

**Deburring:**
- File edges (remove sharp burrs from cutting)
- Smooth with sandpaper
- Safe to handle

**Rust prevention:**
- **Oil:** Light coat, needs reapplication (3-in-1, gun oil, cooking oil)
- **Paint:** Durable, needs surface prep (rust-proof paint)
- **Bluing/patina:** Chemical conversion (prevents rust, darkens)

**Sharpening (blades):**
- File (rough shaping)
- Stone (fine edge)
- Strop (polishing, hair-splitting sharp)

### Plastic Finishing

**Smoothing:**
- Sandpaper (progressively finer)
- Heat (carefully, can melt smooth—practice first)

**Edge treatment:**
- Flame polish (pass quickly through flame, melts smooth—PET, acrylic)
- File + sand (safer, slower)

**UV protection:**
- Paint (opaque, blocks sun)
- Keep indoors (if possible)

## Testing

### Functional Testing

**Does it do the job?**
- Use it for intended purpose
- Note what works well
- Note what's awkward/fails

**If it fails:** Why? Material? Design? Execution?

### Load Testing

**Can it handle expected stress?**

**For tools:**
- Strike with expected force (hammer, axe, etc.)
- Pry with expected load (prybar, lever)
- Cut through expected materials (knife, saw)

**For structures:**
- Apply weight (sit on chair, load shelf)
- Push/pull (test stability)
- Stress joints (twist, rack, bend)

**Progressive loading:** Start light, increase until failure (know limits)

### Time Testing

**How long does it last?**

**Short-term (1 day):**
- Immediate failures (design flaws, weak materials)

**Medium-term (1 week):**
- Wear patterns (what rubs, loosens, breaks)

**Long-term (1 month+):**
- Durability (does it hold up?)
- Maintenance needs (what needs attention?)

**Accelerated testing:** Use it hard (more reps, harsher conditions) to simulate long-term use quickly

### Environmental Testing

**Weather exposure:**
- **Wet:** Does it rot, rust, swell?
- **Dry:** Does it crack, shrink, brittlize?
- **Hot:** Does it warp, melt, weaken?
- **Cold:** Does it crack, become brittle?

**Test before relying on it in critical situations.**

## Iteration

### Nothing Is Perfect on First Try

**Expect:**
- Problems (they're opportunities to improve)
- Multiple versions (V1 → V2 → V3)
- Gradual refinement (good → better → great)

### Common Improvements

**Strengthen:**
- Add material at stress points
- Reinforce joints
- Change design (distribute load better)
- Upgrade materials (stronger, more durable)

**Lighten:**
- Remove unnecessary material
- Hollow out (still strong, less weight)
- Different material (lighter, similar strength)

**Ergonomics:**
- Adjust handle angle (more comfortable)
- Change grip size (fits hand better)
- Rebalance (weight distribution)

**Simplify:**
- Fewer parts (faster to make, less to break)
- Easier assembly (no special tools/alignment)
- Standard materials (easier to source)

### Document Final Version

**Write it down:**
- Materials (types, quantities, sources)
- Dimensions (measured accurately)
- Process (step-by-step, lessons learned)
- Time invested (for planning future projects)

**Draw it:**
- Multiple views (side, top, front)
- Detail views (complicated parts)
- Assembly sequence (numbered steps)

**Photograph it:**
- Finished product (multiple angles)
- Key details (joints, mechanisms, features)

**Why:** You'll forget. Others need to learn. You'll make another.

## Common Projects

### Shelves and Racks
**Purpose:** Storage, organization, off-ground protection

**Basic design:**
- Vertical supports (posts, sides)
- Horizontal shelves (boards, slats)
- Bracing (prevent racking/tipping)

**Materials:** Wood (easy), metal (strong), plastic (lightweight)

**Joinery:** Screws, nails, or notched (dados)

### Carts and Sleds
**Purpose:** Move heavy loads

**Basic design:**
- Platform (flat surface)
- Wheels/runners (reduce friction)
- Handle (push/pull)

**Materials:** Wood frame, metal axles, plastic wheels (or wood if no choice)

**Key:** Low friction (wheels/runners smooth, axle greased)

### Custom Tools
**Purpose:** Task-specific tool not available

**Examples:**
- **Prying tool:** Long lever, flat/curved end (from rebar, steel rod)
- **Striking tool:** Heavy head, handle (from rock + wood)
- **Cutting tool:** Sharp edge, grip (from metal scrap, stone)

**Process:** Define task → sketch → prototype → test → refine

### Repairs
**Purpose:** Extend life of broken items

**Common repairs:**
- **Broken handle:** Replace (wood most common)
- **Dull blade:** Sharpen (file + stone)
- **Loose joint:** Re-tighten, add fastener, or remake joint
- **Cracked frame:** Reinforce (splint + lashing/screws)

**Philosophy:** Repair first, replace only if not fixable

## Application Scenarios

1. Assess: Have plastic bottles, cordage
2. Design: Frame to hold bottles upright, handle to carry
3. Prototype: Cardboard + tape mockup
4. Build: Wood frame, lashed together, cordage handles
5. Test: Load with water, carry distance, check for fails
6. Iterate: Strengthen weak joints, adjust handle length

**Need to dry food (no rack):**
1. Assess: Have wood poles, cordage
2. Design: Horizontal bars suspended, air circulation
3. Prototype: Sketch on paper
4. Build: Lash poles into frame, hang from structure
5. Test: Load with food, check stability, airflow
6. Iterate: Add more bars (capacity), adjust height (airflow)

**Need to filter water (no filter):**
1. Assess: Have plastic bottles, sand, charcoal, cloth
2. Design: Layered filtration (coarse → fine → charcoal)
3. Prototype: One bottle, test layers
4. Build: Cut bottle, layer materials, test flow
5. Test: Pour dirty water, check clarity (still need to purify!)
6. Iterate: Adjust layer thickness, add pre-filter
