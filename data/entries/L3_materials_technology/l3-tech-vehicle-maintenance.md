# Vehicle Maintenance Basics

## Overview

Regular vehicle maintenance prevents breakdowns, extends vehicle life, and ensures safety. This guide covers fundamental procedures: oil changes, tire maintenance, battery testing, fluid checks, air filter replacement, and jump-starting. These skills enable self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on professional mechanics for routine maintenance.

**Economic Reality:** Professional oil change: $40-80. DIY cost: $20-35. Annual savings: $60-180. Over 10 years: $600-1,800 saved, plus knowledge to handle emergencies.

**⚠️ Safety First:** Vehicles contain hazards: hot fluids, moving parts, heavy components, flammable liquids, toxic materials, and crushing risks. Follow safety protocols to prevent injury.

## Oil Change Procedure

### Why Oil Changes Matter

**Engine Oil Functions:**
1. **Lubrication:** Reduces friction between moving parts
2. **Cooling:** Carries heat away from combustion chamber
3. **Cleaning:** Suspends contaminants (carbon, metal particles)
4. **Sealing:** Fills gaps between piston rings and cylinder walls
5. **Corrosion prevention:** Protects metal surfaces from moisture/acids

**Consequences of Neglecting Oil Changes:**
- Sludge buildup (oil breaks down, clogs passages)
- Increased wear (metal-on-metal contact)
- Overheating (poor heat transfer)
- Engine seizure (catastrophic failure, $3,000-8,000 repair)

### Oil Change Intervals

**Modern Vehicles (2010+):**
- Manufacturer recommendation: 5,000-10,000 miles (check owner's manual)
- Synthetic oil: 7,500-10,000 miles typical
- Conventional oil: 3,000-5,000 miles typical

**Severe Service Conditions (Shorter Intervals):**
- Short trips (<10 miles, especially in cold weather)
- Frequent idling (delivery vehicles, police cars)
- Dusty environments (gravel roads, construction)
- Towing heavy loads
- Extreme temperatures (desert, arctic)
- **Recommendation:** Cut interval in half (e.g., 5,000 → 2,500 miles)

**Classic Rule (3,000 miles / 3 months):**
- Originated from 1970s-1980s engine/oil technology
- Overly conservative for modern engines
- Still valid for very old vehicles (pre-1990)

### Tools & Materials Needed

**Essential Tools:**
- [ ] Oil filter wrench (strap, cap, or cup type - matches filter size)
- [ ] Socket wrench or adjustable wrench (drain plug size, typically 14-17mm)
- [ ] Oil drain pan (6+ quart capacity)
- [ ] Funnel
- [ ] Jack and jack stands OR ramps (raise vehicle safely)
- [ ] Wheel chocks (prevent rolling)
- [ ] Gloves (nitrile, protect from hot oil)
- [ ] Rags or shop towels

**Materials:**
- [ ] Engine oil (correct viscosity, quantity per owner's manual)
- [ ] Oil filter (correct part number)
- [ ] Drain plug washer/gasket (if replaceable type)

**Safety Equipment:**
- [ ] Safety glasses (oil splash protection)
- [ ] Fire extinguisher (nearby)

### Oil Selection

**Viscosity Ratings:**
- Format: XXW-YY (e.g., 5W-30)
- First number (XW): Cold-start viscosity (lower = better cold flow)
- Second number (YY): Operating temperature viscosity (higher = thicker when hot)

**Common Viscosity Grades:**
| Viscosity | Climate | Typical Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 0W-20 | Cold climates | Modern fuel-efficient engines |
| 5W-20 | Moderate climates | Modern engines, good cold start |
| 5W-30 | All climates | Most common, wide temperature range |
| 10W-30 | Warm climates | Older engines, higher mileage |
| 10W-40 | Hot climates | High-mileage, high-temperature use |
| 20W-50 | Very hot climates | Classic cars, worn engines |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Use viscosity specified in owner's manual. Wrong viscosity causes:
- Too thin: Inadequate protection, wear, oil consumption
- Too thick: Poor cold-start flow, increased fuel consumption, sluggish performance

**Oil Types:**

| Type | Description | Lifespan | Cost | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|------|----------|
| **Conventional** | Refined petroleum | 3,000-5,000 mi | $ | Older vehicles, budget |
| **Synthetic Blend** | Mix of conventional + synthetic | 5,000-7,500 mi | $$ | Good middle-ground |
| **Full Synthetic** | Lab-engineered molecules | 7,500-15,000 mi | $$$ | Modern engines, extreme conditions |
| **High Mileage** | Additives for seals/wear | 3,000-5,000 mi | $$ | Vehicles >75,000 miles |

**Oil Capacity by Engine Size:**
| Engine Size | Typical Capacity | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| 4-cylinder | 4-5 quarts | Compact cars, sedans |
| V6 | 5-6 quarts | Midsize cars, SUVs |
| V8 | 6-8 quarts | Trucks, large SUVs |
| Diesel | 10-15 quarts | Heavy-duty trucks |

**Check owner's manual for exact capacity** - critical to avoid over/underfilling.

### Oil Change Steps

**Preparation (Safety First):**
1. **Park on level surface** (accurate drain, prevents rolling)
2. **Warm engine 5 minutes** (oil flows better when warm, NOT hot)
3. **Turn off engine, engage parking brake**
4. **Chock wheels** (prevent rolling if jack slips)
5. **Let engine cool 10 minutes** (reduce burn risk from hot oil)

**Step 1: Raise Vehicle**
- **Ramps:** Drive up slowly, center wheels, engage parking brake
- **Jack + Stands:** 
  - Place jack at manufacturer-designated lift point (consult manual)
  - Raise vehicle
  - **NEVER work under vehicle supported only by jack** (jack fails = crushing death)
  - Insert jack stands under frame rails or designated points
  - Lower vehicle onto stands (jack remains in place as backup)
  - Shake vehicle to verify stability

**Step 2: Locate Drain Plug & Oil Filter**
- **Drain plug:** Bottom of oil pan (lowest point on engine)
  - Typically 14-17mm bolt
  - May have square recess (use 3/8" ratchet directly)
- **Oil filter:** Side or bottom of engine
  - Cylindrical canister (spin-on type) or housing (cartridge type)

**Step 3: Drain Old Oil**
1. Position drain pan under drain plug
2. Loosen drain plug with wrench (counterclockwise)
3. Final turns by hand (oil begins draining)
4. **Remove plug quickly, pull hand away** (oil streams out)
5. Let drain completely (10-15 minutes)
6. Inspect drained oil:
   - Black = normal (carbon deposits)
   - Milky/foamy = coolant contamination (head gasket leak - serious)
   - Metallic = bearing wear (serious problem)
   - Thick sludge = neglected maintenance

**Step 4: Replace Drain Plug**
1. Wipe drain plug threads clean
2. Inspect drain plug washer/gasket:
   - Crushable washer: Replace every change (aluminum or copper)
   - Rubber O-ring: Replace if damaged, reusable for 2-3 changes
3. Hand-thread drain plug (prevent cross-threading)
4. Torque specifications:
   | Plug Type | Torque Spec |
   |-----------|-------------|
   | 14mm | 25-30 ft-lbs |
   | 17mm | 30-35 ft-lbs |
   | Oil pan plug (typical) | 20-30 ft-lbs |
5. **DON'T OVERTIGHTEN** - strips threads in aluminum oil pan ($500-2,000 repair)
   - Rule of thumb: Snug with wrench, then 1/4 turn

**Step 5: Remove Old Oil Filter**
1. Position drain pan under filter
2. Unscrew filter counterclockwise (may be tight)
3. If stuck: Use oil filter wrench
   - Strap wrench (adjustable, works on most sizes)
   - Cap wrench (specific size, better grip)
   - Cup wrench with ratchet (professional grade)
4. Oil will spill when filter removed (expect 1/4-1/2 cup)
5. Wipe filter mounting surface clean (remove old gasket residue)

**Step 6: Install New Oil Filter**
1. Check that old gasket came off with old filter
   - **CRITICAL:** If old gasket stays on engine, new filter won't seal (oil leak, pressure loss, engine damage)
2. Apply thin layer of clean oil to new filter gasket
   - Finger on new oil cap, touch gasket (light coating)
   - Ensures proper seal, eases installation
3. Hand-tighten filter onto engine
   - Spin on until gasket contacts mounting surface
   - Turn additional 3/4 turn (hand-tight only, NO TOOLS)
4. **DO NOT use filter wrench to install** - overtightening crushes gasket, makes next removal difficult

**Step 7: Add New Oil**
1. Lower vehicle (if raised)
2. Locate oil fill cap (top of engine, marked "OIL" or oil can symbol)
3. Remove fill cap
4. Insert funnel
5. Pour oil slowly:
   - Start with 1 quart less than capacity (e.g., if capacity is 5 qt, pour 4 qt first)
   - Pause to let oil drain into pan
   - Check dipstick after initial pour
6. **Check oil level with dipstick:**
   - Remove dipstick, wipe clean
   - Reinsert fully, remove again
   - Check level:
     - Between MIN and MAX (or cross-hatched area) = correct
     - Below MIN = add 1/2 quart, recheck
     - Above MAX = drain some (overfilling damages engine)

**Step 8: Check for Leaks**
1. Replace oil fill cap
2. Start engine
3. Run 2-3 minutes (circulates oil through filter)
4. **Watch oil pressure light:**
   - Should turn off within 5 seconds (oil pressure builds)
   - Stays on = problem (shut off immediately, investigate)
5. Shut off engine
6. Inspect drain plug and filter for leaks
   - Drips = tighten slightly
   - No leaks = good
7. Wait 5 minutes (oil drains to pan)
8. Recheck oil level on dipstick
   - Top off if needed (oil fills filter, level drops slightly)

**Step 9: Record Maintenance**
- Note date and mileage in maintenance log
- Reset oil life monitor (if equipped - consult manual)
- Calculate next oil change mileage

**Step 10: Dispose of Used Oil**
- Pour into sealed container (used oil bottles work)
- Take to auto parts store, quick-lube, or recycling center
- **NEVER pour in drain, trash, or ground** (illegal, toxic, environmental crime)

### Common Oil Change Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Overtightening drain plug | Torque to spec or snug + 1/4 turn |
| Using filter wrench to install filter | Hand-tight only (3/4 turn past contact) |
| Overfilling oil | Fill to MAX mark, not above |
| Changing cold oil | Warm engine 5 min (better drain) |
| Not replacing drain plug washer | New washer every change (aluminum type) |
| Reusing old filter "just this once" | Always replace filter with oil |
| Wrong oil viscosity | Check owner's manual (e.g., 5W-30) |
| Working under vehicle on jack only | ALWAYS use jack stands |
| Not checking for leaks after change | Run engine, inspect drain plug/filter |
| Mixing oil brands/types mid-change | OK to mix, but synthetic blend = defeats synthetic benefits |

## Tire Maintenance

### Tire Pressure

**Why Pressure Matters:**
- **Underinflated (most common):**
  - Increased rolling resistance (worse fuel economy, 3-5% loss per 10 PSI under)
  - Tire overheating (sidewall flexing generates heat)
  - Premature wear (outer edges wear faster)
  - Blowout risk (heat buildup causes failure)
- **Overinflated:**
  - Harsh ride (less sidewall cushioning)
  - Center tread wears faster
  - Reduced traction (smaller contact patch)
  - Blowout risk on impact (pothole, curb)

**Correct Pressure:**
- **NOT the number on tire sidewall** (that's MAX pressure for max load)
- Found on:
  - Driver's door jamb sticker
  - Owner's manual
  - Sometimes fuel door or glove box
- Typical values: 30-35 PSI (passenger cars), 40-80 PSI (trucks/SUVs)

**Checking Tire Pressure:**

**Tools:**
- Tire pressure gauge (digital or analog, $5-20)
- Analog pencil gauge: Cheap, reliable
- Digital gauge: Easier to read, more accurate

**Procedure:**
1. **Check when cold** (driven <1 mile, or 3+ hours since driving)
   - Tires heat up during driving, pressure increases 4-6 PSI
   - Hot pressure reads falsely high
2. Remove valve stem cap
3. Press gauge firmly onto valve stem (perpendicular)
4. Read pressure:
   - Digital: Displays number
   - Analog: Stick extends with PSI marking
5. Compare to recommended pressure (door jamb sticker)
6. Add air if low:
   - At gas station (free or $0.25-1.00)
   - Portable compressor ($30-100)
   - Add in short bursts, recheck frequently
   - **Don't overinflate** - easier to add than remove
7. Release air if overinflated:
   - Press valve stem core with gauge or tool
   - Short bursts, recheck

**Checking Frequency:**
- Monthly minimum
- Before long trips
- Seasonal changes (10°F drop = 1 PSI loss)
- After hitting pothole/curb

**Nitrogen vs. Air:**
- Air: 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen
- Pure nitrogen: Slower pressure loss (larger molecules)
- Benefit marginal for passenger vehicles (race cars, aircraft benefit)
- Cost: $5-10 per tire vs free air
- Verdict: Air is fine for most vehicles

### Tread Depth & Wear

**Minimum Legal Tread Depth:**
- 2/32" (1.6mm) in most US states
- **REPLACE BEFORE THIS** - unsafe in rain/snow

**Safe Replacement Depth:**
- **4/32" for all-season tires** (wet traction degrades below this)
- **6/32" for winter/snow tires** (snow traction requires deep tread)

**Tread Depth Measurement:**

**Penny Test (Quick Check):**
1. Insert penny into tread groove (Lincoln's head down)
2. If top of Lincoln's head is visible: <2/32", REPLACE IMMEDIATELY
3. If head partially covered: Adequate tread remains

**Quarter Test (Better Margin):**
1. Insert quarter into tread groove (Washington's head down)
2. If top of head is visible: <4/32", consider replacing soon
3. Provides safer margin before legal minimum

**Tread Depth Gauge (Accurate):**
- Tool with measuring probe ($5-15)
- Insert probe into tread groove
- Read depth directly (1/32" increments)

**Wear Patterns (Diagnosis):**

| Wear Pattern | Cause | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Center wear** | Overinflation | Reduce pressure to recommended |
| **Edge wear (both sides)** | Underinflation | Increase pressure to recommended |
| **One-side wear** | Misalignment | Wheel alignment service |
| **Cupping (scalloped dips)** | Worn suspension (shocks) | Replace shocks/struts |
| **Feathering (diagonal wear)** | Misalignment | Wheel alignment service |
| **Flat spots** | Hard braking (locked wheels) | Avoid hard braking, check ABS |

**Tire Rotation:**

**Purpose:** Even wear (front tires wear faster on front-wheel-drive vehicles)

**Rotation Interval:** Every 5,000-8,000 miles (often done with oil change)

**Rotation Patterns:**
- **Front-wheel drive:** Front tires to rear (same side), rear tires to front (cross sides)
- **Rear-wheel drive:** Rear tires to front (same side), front tires to rear (cross sides)
- **All-wheel drive:** Cross pattern (front left → rear right, front right → rear left, etc.)
- **Directional tires:** Front-to-rear only (tires have rotation direction arrow)

**DIY Rotation:**
1. Loosen lug nuts (while tires on ground)
2. Raise vehicle (one end at a time or all four corners)
3. Remove wheels
4. Swap positions per rotation pattern
5. Torque lug nuts to spec (typically 80-100 ft-lbs, check manual)
6. Lower vehicle
7. Final torque check (after 50-100 miles)

## Battery Testing & Maintenance

### Battery Basics

**Lead-Acid Battery (Most Common):**
- 12V nominal (actually 12.6V when fully charged)
- 6 cells × 2.1V each
- Lead plates in sulfuric acid electrolyte
- Chemical reaction produces electricity

**Battery Lifespan:**
- 3-5 years typical
- Shorter in hot climates (heat accelerates degradation)
- Longer in moderate climates with proper maintenance

**Failure Symptoms:**
- Slow cranking (engine turns over sluggishly)
- Clicking sound when starting (insufficient power)
- Dim lights when starting
- Electrical accessories weak or flickering
- Corrosion on terminals

### Battery Testing

**Visual Inspection:**
- [ ] Corrosion on terminals (white/blue powder)
- [ ] Cracked case (leaking acid)
- [ ] Bulging case (overcharged or frozen)
- [ ] Loose hold-down (vibration damages battery)

**Voltage Test (Resting):**

**Tools:** Digital multimeter

**Procedure:**
1. Battery off (key out, everything off)
2. Wait 2+ hours (surface charge dissipates)
3. Set multimeter to DC voltage (20V scale)
4. Red probe to positive (+) terminal
5. Black probe to negative (-) terminal
6. Read voltage:
   | Voltage | State of Charge | Status |
   |---------|-----------------|--------|
   | 12.6V+ | 100% | Fully charged |
   | 12.4V | 75% | Good |
   | 12.2V | 50% | Charge needed |
   | 12.0V | 25% | Low, charge immediately |
   | <11.9V | Discharged | Charge and test, may be failing |

**Load Test (Most Accurate):**

**Tools:** Battery load tester (carbon pile tester, $50-200) or professional test at auto parts store (free)

**Procedure:**
1. Fully charge battery (12.6V+)
2. Apply load equal to half CCA rating for 15 seconds
   - Example: 600 CCA battery → 300A load
3. Voltage should not drop below 9.6V
4. If drops below 9.6V: Battery failing, replace

**Charging System Test:**
1. Start engine
2. Measure voltage at battery terminals
3. Should read 13.8-14.4V (alternator charging)
4. If <13.5V: Alternator not charging (electrical problem)
5. If >14.8V: Overcharging (voltage regulator issue)

### Battery Maintenance

**Terminal Cleaning:**

**When corrosion present (white/blue powder):**
1. Turn off engine, remove key
2. Disconnect negative (-) terminal first (prevents shorts)
3. Disconnect positive (+) terminal
4. Mix baking soda + water (1 tbsp per cup)
5. Pour over terminals (neutralizes acid, fizzes)
6. Scrub with wire brush
7. Rinse with water
8. Dry thoroughly
9. Apply dielectric grease or anti-corrosion spray
10. Reconnect positive (+) terminal first
11. Reconnect negative (-) terminal second
12. Tighten firmly (hand-tight, no excessive force)

**Why Disconnect Negative First:**
- Negative terminal connected to vehicle chassis (ground)
- If wrench touches chassis while loosening positive: Short circuit, sparks, potential fire
- Disconnecting negative first eliminates ground path (safe)

**Corrosion Prevention:**
- Felt terminal protector washers (soak in grease)
- Anti-corrosion spray (red or blue aerosol)
- Dielectric grease on terminals

**Fluid Check (Flooded Batteries Only):**
- Modern "maintenance-free" batteries are sealed (no access)
- Older flooded batteries have removable caps
- Check electrolyte level (should cover plates by 1/4")
- Add distilled water ONLY (not tap water, not acid)
- Do NOT overfill (expands when charging)

## Fluid Checks

### Coolant (Antifreeze)

**Purpose:**
- Prevents freezing (winter protection to -34°F or lower)
- Prevents boiling (summer protection, raises boiling point to 265°F with pressure cap)
- Corrosion protection (rust inhibitors)

**Checking Coolant Level:**
1. **Engine cold** (wait 30+ minutes after driving - hot coolant under pressure can spray/burn)
2. Locate coolant reservoir (translucent plastic tank)
3. Check level against MIN/MAX markings
4. Should be between MIN and MAX when cold
5. If low: Add 50/50 mix of coolant + distilled water
6. **NEVER open radiator cap when hot** (pressurized steam causes severe burns)

**Coolant Color:**
- Green (traditional ethylene glycol)
- Orange (Dexcool, GM vehicles)
- Pink/red (Asian vehicles)
- Yellow/gold (European vehicles)
- **Don't mix colors** - different chemistries can react (sludge formation)

**Replacement Interval:**
- 30,000-50,000 miles or 3-5 years (check manual)
- Neglect causes corrosion (rust, scale), overheating, water pump failure

### Brake Fluid

**Purpose:**
- Hydraulic fluid transmits pedal force to brake calipers
- Very high boiling point (400-500°F)

**Checking Brake Fluid Level:**
1. Locate brake fluid reservoir (top of master cylinder, firewall side of engine bay)
2. Check level through translucent reservoir
3. Should be between MIN and MAX
4. If low: Add DOT 3, DOT 4, or DOT 5.1 (check cap marking)
   - **DOT 5 (silicone) incompatible with DOT 3/4** - do NOT mix
5. **Low level = worn brake pads** (fluid fills space as pads wear)
   - Slight drop over time = normal
   - Sudden drop = leak (serious safety issue, inspect immediately)

**Brake Fluid Hygroscopic:**
- Absorbs moisture from air (lowers boiling point)
- Old fluid (>2-3 years): Increased water content
- Water boils under hard braking → vapor in lines → "spongy" pedal, brake failure
- Replacement every 2-3 years recommended (often neglected)

### Transmission Fluid

**Purpose:**
- Lubricates gears/clutches
- Hydraulic fluid (shifts gears in automatic)
- Cooling

**Checking Transmission Fluid (Automatic):**

**Note:** Some modern vehicles have sealed transmissions (no dipstick, dealer service only)

**Procedure (Vehicles with Dipstick):**
1. **Engine warm** (drive 10-15 minutes)
2. **Engine running** (transmission in PARK) - check owner's manual, some require engine OFF
3. Locate transmission dipstick (usually red handle, rear of engine bay)
4. Remove dipstick, wipe clean
5. Reinsert fully, remove again
6. Check level:
   - Should be in "HOT" range (cross-hatched area)
   - If cold, read "COLD" range
7. If low: Add fluid through dipstick tube (use funnel)
   - Add 1/2 pint at a time, recheck (overfilling causes foaming, shift problems)
   - **Use correct fluid type** (ATF +4, Dexron VI, Mercon V, etc. - check manual)

**Fluid Condition:**
- Red/pink and translucent: Good
- Brown/dark: Aged but OK
- Black or burnt smell: Overheated, replace fluid
- Milky: Coolant contamination (serious problem - transmission cooler failure)

**Replacement Interval:**
- 30,000-60,000 miles (severe service)
- 60,000-100,000 miles (normal service)
- "Lifetime" fluid: Actually 100,000-150,000 miles (manufacturer euphemism)

### Power Steering Fluid

**Purpose:**
- Hydraulic assist for steering

**Checking Power Steering Fluid:**
1. Engine off (fluid level fluctuates with engine running)
2. Locate reservoir (small tank, often has steering wheel symbol)
3. Check level (some have dipstick, some show through translucent tank)
4. Should be between MIN and MAX
5. If low: Add power steering fluid (ATF compatible in many vehicles - check manual)

**Low Fluid Symptoms:**
- Whining noise when turning
- Stiff steering
- Jerky steering

### Windshield Washer Fluid

**Purpose:**
- Cleans windshield

**Checking/Filling:**
1. Locate reservoir (blue cap with windshield symbol)
2. Open cap
3. Fill to fill line or neck
4. Use windshield washer fluid (not water):
   - Water freezes in winter
   - Washer fluid has detergent, antifreeze
   - Cost: $3-5 per gallon

## Air Filter Replacement

### Purpose

**Engine Air Filter:**
- Prevents dirt/debris from entering engine
- Clogged filter restricts airflow (reduces power, fuel economy)

**Cabin Air Filter:**
- Filters air entering HVAC system
- Clogged filter reduces airflow (weak AC/heat)

### Engine Air Filter Replacement

**Replacement Interval:**
- 15,000-30,000 miles (normal driving)
- 10,000-15,000 miles (dusty conditions)
- Inspect at every oil change

**Procedure:**
1. Locate air filter housing (large plastic box, air intake duct connects to it)
2. Release clips or remove screws (housing cover)
3. Lift cover, remove old filter
4. Inspect filter:
   - Light dust: Tap to dislodge, may reuse
   - Dark/clogged: Replace
   - Oil (oiled filters): Clean and re-oil per instructions
5. Wipe housing interior (remove debris)
6. Insert new filter (directional arrow points toward engine)
7. Replace cover, secure clips/screws
8. **Ensure proper seating** (gaps allow unfiltered air = engine damage)

**Cost:** $10-25 (DIY), $30-60 (shop)

**Time:** 5-10 minutes

### Cabin Air Filter Replacement

**Replacement Interval:**
- 15,000-30,000 miles
- Annually
- When airflow weak or smell present

**Location (Varies by Vehicle):**
- Behind glove box (most common)
- Under dashboard
- Under hood (near windshield base)

**Procedure (Glove Box Access):**
1. Empty glove box
2. Remove glove box (squeeze sides, releases stops)
3. Locate filter cover (behind glove box opening)
4. Remove cover (tabs or screws)
5. Slide out old filter
6. Insert new filter (directional arrow points toward fan)
7. Replace cover
8. Reinstall glove box

**Cost:** $10-25 (DIY), $30-80 (shop)

**Time:** 10-15 minutes

**Symptoms of Clogged Cabin Filter:**
- Weak airflow from vents
- Musty smell
- Foggy windows (poor dehumidification)

## Jump-Starting Procedure

### When Needed

**Dead Battery Symptoms:**
- No cranking (clicking sound only)
- Dim/no lights
- Electrical accessories dead

**Causes:**
- Left lights on
- Battery old/weak
- Charging system failure (alternator)
- Parasitic drain (something staying on when car off)

### Safety Precautions

**Hydrogen Gas:**
- Batteries produce explosive hydrogen gas during charging
- **NO SPARKS near battery** (last connection away from battery)
- **NO SMOKING** near batteries

**Electrical Shock:**
- 12V is safe (no shock risk)
- **BUT:** Short circuit can cause:
  - Sparks (fire risk)
  - Cable overheating (burns)
  - Battery explosion

**Reversed Polarity:**
- Connecting positive to negative (and vice versa) causes:
  - Sparks, fire
  - Electrical system damage (ECU, alternator)
  - **DOUBLE-CHECK polarity before connecting**

### Jump-Starting Steps

**Equipment:**
- Jumper cables (10-12 ft length, 4-6 gauge wire)
- Working vehicle (donor) with good battery
- Or portable jump starter (battery pack with cables)

**Preparation:**
1. Position vehicles close (cables reach) but NOT touching
2. Turn off both vehicles
3. Turn off all accessories (lights, radio, HVAC)
4. Engage parking brakes

**Connection Sequence (CRITICAL - Follow Exactly):**

**⚠️ MEMORIZE THIS ORDER:**

1. **RED to DEAD (+):**
   - Red clamp to positive (+) terminal on DEAD battery
   - Positive terminal larger, marked "POS" or "+", red cover

2. **RED to DONOR (+):**
   - Other red clamp to positive (+) terminal on DONOR battery

3. **BLACK to DONOR (-):**
   - Black clamp to negative (-) terminal on DONOR battery

4. **BLACK to GROUND (DEAD):**
   - Other black clamp to UNPAINTED METAL on DEAD vehicle
   - Examples: Engine block, frame, ground strap
   - **NOT to dead battery negative terminal** (risk of hydrogen ignition)
   - At least 18" from battery if possible

**Starting Sequence:**
1. Start DONOR vehicle
2. Let run 2-3 minutes (charges dead battery slightly)
3. Attempt to start DEAD vehicle
   - Cranks and starts: Success
   - Cranks slowly: Wait 5 more minutes, try again
   - No crank: Check connections, battery may be completely dead
4. If starts: Let run 5 minutes (alternator begins charging)

**Disconnection Sequence (REVERSE ORDER):**

1. **BLACK from GROUND (DEAD)** - remove ground clamp from dead vehicle
2. **BLACK from DONOR (-)** - remove negative from donor battery
3. **RED from DONOR (+)** - remove positive from donor battery
4. **RED from DEAD (+)** - remove positive from dead battery

**After Jump-Start:**
- Drive vehicle 20-30 minutes (recharge battery)
- Avoid short trips for 1-2 days (battery needs full recharge)
- Test battery and charging system (auto parts store - free test)
- If battery repeatedly dies: Replace battery or repair charging system

### Portable Jump Starter (Battery Pack)

**Advantages:**
- No donor vehicle needed
- Compact (size of lunch box)
- Built-in safety (reverse polarity protection, spark protection)
- Often includes USB charging, flashlight

**Procedure:**
1. Connect red clamp to positive (+) terminal
2. Connect black clamp to negative (-) terminal (or ground)
3. Turn on jump starter
4. Attempt to start vehicle
5. If starts: Disconnect immediately (don't leave connected)
6. Recharge jump starter after use

**Cost:** $50-150

### Common Jump-Start Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Connecting black clamp to dead battery negative | Connect to unpainted metal (ground) away from battery |
| Reversed polarity (red to negative, black to positive) | Double-check: RED = positive (+), BLACK = negative (-) or ground |
| Vehicles touching during jump | Position close but NOT touching (prevents ground loop) |
| Leaving cables connected while starting donor | Connect all cables BEFORE starting donor |
| Cheap/thin cables (16 gauge) | Use 4-6 gauge cables (heavy wire, low resistance) |
| Jump-starting frozen battery | Thaw battery first (frozen can explode when charged) |
| Jump-starting cracked battery | Replace battery (can leak acid, explode) |

## Common Vehicle Maintenance Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Oil changes every 3,000 mi (wasteful, outdated) | Follow manufacturer interval (5,000-10,000 mi) |
| Ignoring tire pressure (monthly checks) | Check monthly, cold tires, door jamb spec |
| Never rotating tires | Rotate every 5,000-8,000 mi (even wear) |
| Filling coolant reservoir with tap water | Use 50/50 coolant/distilled water mix |
| Mixing coolant colors/types | Use same type, or flush and refill |
| Working under vehicle on jack only | ALWAYS use jack stands (jack can fail) |
| Not recording maintenance | Log date/mileage (track intervals) |
| Ignoring fluid leaks | Investigate immediately (small leaks become big problems) |
| Using wrong oil viscosity | Check owner's manual (e.g., 5W-30) |
| Overfilling fluids | Fill to MAX mark (not above) |
