# Solar Charge Controllers

## Overview

Charge controllers regulate power from solar panels to batteries, preventing overcharge damage while maximizing energy harvest. The two main types—PWM and MPPT—differ drastically in efficiency, cost, and application.

**Key Principle**: Solar panels produce variable voltage/current based on sunlight. Controllers ensure batteries receive optimal charging voltage and current for their chemistry and state of charge.

---

## PWM vs MPPT Comparison

### PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

**How it works**: Rapidly switches panel connection on/off to maintain battery voltage

**Principle**:
- Panel voltage "pulled down" to battery voltage (17-18V panel → 14.4V battery)
- Excess voltage discarded (not converted to extra current)
- Essentially a fast on/off switch with no voltage conversion

**Efficiency**: 75-80% (loses ~20-25% of potential power)

**Advantages**:
- ✓ Low cost ($30-100 for 30A controller)
- ✓ Simple, reliable (fewer components to fail)
- ✓ No fan/cooling needed (low heat generation)
- ✓ Works in any temperature range

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Panel voltage must match battery (17-18V panels for 12V, 34-36V for 24V)
- ❌ Cannot use high-voltage panels efficiently
- ❌ 20-25% power loss vs MPPT
- ❌ Only parallel panel connections practical

**Best for**: Small systems (<400W), tight budget, panels voltage-matched to battery

---

### MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking)

**How it works**: DC-DC converter finds panel's maximum power point, converts excess voltage to current

**Principle**:
- Panels operate at their optimal voltage (30-40V typical)
- Controller steps down voltage, boosts current (conservation of power)
- Continuously tracks maximum power point as sun/temp changes

**Efficiency**: 94-98% (only 2-6% loss)

**Advantages**:
- ✓ 20-30% more power harvest vs PWM
- ✓ High-voltage strings (up to 100-150V input)
- ✓ Smaller wire gauge (higher voltage = lower current)
- ✓ Better cold weather performance (high Voc boost)
- ✓ Can mismatch panel/battery voltages (36V panel → 12V battery)

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Higher cost ($150-500 for 30A controller)
- ❌ More complex (electronics can fail)
- ❌ Cooling fan required (high-power models)
- ❌ Efficiency drops in extreme heat (>50°C)

**Best for**: Large systems (>400W), long wire runs, cold climates, maximum efficiency

<!-- MANUAL_REVIEW: complex table below — convert to bullets -->
| Feature | PWM | MPPT |
|---------|-----|------|
| **Efficiency** | 75-80% | 94-98% |
| **Cost (30A)** | $30-100 | $150-500 |

---

## PWM vs MPPT

**Scenario**: 300W array (2× 150W panels), 12V battery bank, 24V nominal panels (Vmp 36V, Imp 8.3A)

### PWM Configuration

**Panel wiring**: Parallel (to match 12V battery)
- Combined: 18V (pulled to battery voltage), 16.6A
- Power to battery: 14.4V × 16.6A = **239W** (loses 61W!)

**Why loss?**: Panel Vmp (36V) forced to 14.4V → wastes 21.6V × 8.3A = 179W per panel

---

### MPPT Configuration

**Panel wiring**: Series (for higher voltage)
- Combined: 72V, 8.3A = 598W input
- Conversion: 72V × 8.3A = 598W → 14.4V × 41.5A = **598W output** (minus 3% controller loss = 580W)

**Gain**: MPPT delivers **341W more** (141% of PWM output!)

**Break-even**: MPPT costs $200 more, saves $0.50/kWh → break-even in 1-2 years

---

## Charge Ctrl

### Current Rating

**Formula**:
```
Controller Current = (Array Watts ÷ Battery Voltage) × 1.25 (safety factor)
```

**PWM Example** (12V system, 400W array):
```
400W ÷ 12V × 1.25 = 41.7A → choose 50A controller
```

**MPPT Example** (12V system, 800W array):
```
800W ÷ 12V × 1.25 = 83.3A → choose 100A controller
```

**Derating factors**:
- Add 25% margin (controllers derate in heat)
- Future expansion (easier to oversize now)
- Cold weather boost (MPPT delivers 10-25% more in winter)

---

### Voltage Rating (MPPT Only)

**Input voltage limits**: Must not exceed controller maximum (damage/shutdown)

**Calculation**:
```
Maximum Array Voc = Panel Voc × Number in Series × Cold Temp Factor
```

**Cold temperature boost**:
- Panel Voc increases ~0.4%/°C below 25°C
- Example: -20°C = 45°C below 25°C → 45 × 0.4% = **18% boost**

**Example** (3× panels, Voc 45V, -20°C minimum temp):
```
Cold Voc = 45V × 1.18 = 53.1V per panel
String Voc = 53.1V × 3 = 159.3V
```
**Required controller**: 200V input rating (150V insufficient!)

---

### Sizing Table

**MPPT controllers** (common ratings):

<!-- MANUAL_REVIEW: complex table below — convert to bullets -->
| Array Size | 12V Battery | 24V Battery | 48V Battery | Input Voltage |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 400-600W | 50A | 30A | 20A | 100V |
| 700-1000W | 80A | 40A | 30A | 100-150V |
| 1200-1600W | 100A | 60A | 40A | 150V |
| 2000-3000W | - | 80-100A | 60A | 150-250V |

**PWM controllers** (simpler sizing):

**Array Current:** Controller Rating
**<20A:** 30A
**20-30A:** 40A
**30-40A:** 50A
**40-60A:** 60A

---

## Battery Config

### Charging Stages

**3-Stage charging** (industry standard):

1. **Bulk**: Maximum current until absorption voltage reached (~80% SoC)
2. **Absorption**: Hold voltage constant, current tapers to ~2% of capacity (~95% SoC)
3. **Float**: Maintain voltage indefinitely, very low current (100% SoC, prevent self-discharge)

---

### Voltage Settings by Battery Type

**12V nominal system** (multiply by 2 for 24V, by 4 for 48V):

<!-- MANUAL_REVIEW: complex table below — convert to bullets -->
| Battery Type | Bulk/Absorption | Float | Equalize | Temp Comp |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Flooded Lead-Acid** | 14.4-14.8V | 13.2-13.6V | 15.0-16.0V | -0.03V/°C |
| **AGM** | 14.4-14.7V | 13.3-13.8V | None | -0.03V/°C |
| **Gel** | 14.1-14.4V | 13.6-13.8V | None | -0.03V/°C |
| **LiFePO4** | 14.2-14.6V | 13.6-14.0V | None | None |

⚠️ **Critical**: Wrong voltage settings = shortened battery life or damage!

---

### Absorption Time

**Purpose**: Allow current to taper, fully charge battery

**Settings**:
- Flooded lead-acid: **2-4 hours** (allows gassing, mixes electrolyte)
- AGM: **1-2 hours** (less gassing)
- Gel: **2-3 hours**
- LiFePO4: **0.5-1 hour** (charges fast, minimal taper)

**Adaptive absorption**: Some MPPT controllers adjust time based on how discharged battery was (longer absorption if deeper discharge)

---

### Temperature Compensation

**Why needed**: Battery chemistry changes with temperature
- Cold: Higher voltage needed to achieve same charge current
- Hot: Lower voltage prevents overcharge and gassing

**Implementation**:
- External sensor (wire probe mounted on battery terminal)
- Built-in sensor (controller measures air temp, less accurate)

**Example** (12V FLA at 5°C):
```
Baseline: 14.4V at 25°C
Temp delta: 25°C - 5°C = 20°C
Compensation: 20°C × 0.03V/°C = +0.6V
Adjusted voltage: 14.4V + 0.6V = 15.0V
```

**Result**: Prevents under-charging in cold weather (low voltage = incomplete charge)

---

## Installation & Wiring

### Connection Order (Critical!)

**Always connect in this order** (prevents controller damage):

1. **Battery first** (controller needs voltage reference)
- Connect battery + to controller battery +
- Connect battery - to controller battery -
- Verify controller powers on, displays battery voltage
   
2. **Solar array last** (panels covered or disconnect open)
- Verify polarity with multimeter before connecting
- Connect panel + to controller PV +
- Connect panel - to controller PV -
- Uncover panels or close array disconnect

**Why this order?**: Connecting array before battery causes voltage spike → controller damage

**Disconnection order** (reverse):
1. Disconnect array first (or cover panels)
2. Disconnect battery last

---

### Wire Sizing

**Array to controller** (high voltage, lower current for MPPT):

**PWM** (12V system, 30A):
- Use **l3-tech-solar-wiring** tables
- 10 ft run: 10 AWG
- 25 ft run: 8 AWG

**MPPT** (12V system, 800W array at 80V):
- Current: 800W ÷ 80V = 10A
- 10 ft run: 14 AWG
- 25 ft run: 12 AWG
- **Benefit**: Much smaller wire due to higher voltage!

---

**Controller to battery** (low voltage, very high current):

<!-- MANUAL_REVIEW: complex table below — convert to bullets -->
| Power Output | 12V | 24V | 48V |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|
| 500W | 6 AWG | 10 AWG | 12 AWG |
| 1000W | 2 AWG | 6 AWG | 10 AWG |
| 1500W | 1/0 AWG | 4 AWG | 8 AWG |
| 2000W | 2/0 AWG | 2 AWG | 6 AWG |

Based on 3% voltage drop, 5 ft run. Adjust for actual distance.

---

### Mounting & Ventilation

**Location**:
- Close to battery bank (minimize high-current wire run)
- Ventilated space (controllers generate heat)
- Protected from weather (indoor or NEMA enclosure)
- Accessible for monitoring/adjustment

**Clearance**:
- 6" minimum on all sides (air circulation)
- Fan-cooled models: Don't block fan intake/exhaust
- Temperature: <40°C ambient for full power output

**Orientation**: Mount vertically (heat rises, improves cooling)

---

## Configuration & Setup

### Initial Configuration Steps

1. **Set battery type** (FLA / AGM / Gel / LiFePO4)
- Controller applies correct voltage profile
- Temperature compensation enabled/disabled
   
2. **Set system voltage** (12V / 24V / 48V)
- Auto-detect on most controllers
- Verify display shows correct voltage
   
3. **Install temperature sensor** (if equipped)
- Mount on battery terminal (not case)
- Secure with zip tie or adhesive
- Verify controller displays battery temp
   
4. **Set absorption time** (per battery type)
- Default settings usually acceptable
- Adjust if consistently under/overcharging
   
5. **Set load disconnect** (if controller has load output)
- Low voltage disconnect (LVD): 11.5V (12V system)
- Reconnect voltage: 12.6V
- Prevents battery over-discharge

---

### Advanced Settings

**Equalization** (flooded lead-acid only):
- Voltage: 15.0-16.0V (12V system)
- Duration: 2-4 hours
- Frequency: Monthly or when specific gravity variance >0.030
- **Never equalize AGM, Gel, or LiFePO4!**

**Battery capacity setting**:
- Enter Ah rating (controller tracks state of charge)
- More accurate SoC estimation
- Tailored absorption time

**Load control**:
- Scheduled on/off (street light mode)
- Voltage-based (disconnect at low SoC)
- Manual override

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

**Display panels show**:
- **Battery voltage**: Current state (12.8V = ~100% SoC, 12.0V = ~50%)
- **Array voltage**: Panel output (should be near Vmp during bulk)
- **Charge current**: Amps flowing to battery (high in bulk, tapers in absorption)
- **Daily energy**: kWh harvested today
- **Battery state of charge**: % (if capacity configured)

---

### Charging Stage Indicators

**Bulk stage**:
- Array voltage: Vmp (30-40V for typical panels)
- Current: Maximum (controller limit or panel limit)
- Battery voltage: Rising toward absorption setpoint
- **Normal duration**: 2-6 hours (depends on battery discharge depth)

**Absorption stage**:
- Array voltage: May be lower (panel operating below Vmp)
- Current: Tapering (decreases exponentially)
- Battery voltage: Held constant at absorption setpoint
- **Normal duration**: 1-4 hours (until current drops to 2-5% of capacity)

**Float stage**:
- Array voltage: Variable (often significantly below Vmp)
- Current: Very low (<1% of capacity)
- Battery voltage: Held at float setpoint
- **Duration**: Indefinite (maintains battery at 100%)

---

### Troubleshooting Displays

**"Overvoltage error"**:
- Array voltage exceeds controller input rating
- Check series string count (too many panels)
- Check cold weather Voc (multiply by 1.2 for winter)
- **Fix**: Reduce panels in series, or upgrade controller

**"Battery voltage too low"**:
- Battery deeply discharged (<10V)
- Controller may not charge until manually reset
- **Fix**: Charge battery with separate charger to >11V, reset controller

**"Temperature sensor error"**:
- Sensor disconnected or failed
- Controller may charge without temp compensation (risk of over/undercharge)
- **Fix**: Reconnect sensor or disable temp comp in settings

**"Overcurrent"**:
- Array producing more current than controller rated for
- Short circuit in wiring
- **Fix**: Check parallel strings, reduce array size, or upgrade controller

## Common Errors

### ❌ **Mistake 1**: Connecting array before battery

**Result**: Controller sees high voltage spike → damaged input circuitry

**✓ Solution**: Always battery first, array last. Label controller clearly!

---

### ❌ **Mistake 2**: Using PWM with high-voltage panels

**Example**: 72-cell panel (Vmp 40V) with 12V battery
- PWM pulls 40V → 14V, wastes 26V × 8A = 208W per panel
- **Only 35% efficient!**

**✓ Solution**: Use MPPT, or buy 12V-nominal panels (36-cell, Vmp ~18V) for PWM

---

### ❌ **Mistake 3**: Undersizing controller for future expansion

**Result**: Add panels later → exceed controller rating → need new controller

**✓ Solution**: Oversize 25-50% initially (minimal cost increase, huge flexibility)

---

### ❌ **Mistake 4**: Wrong battery type setting

**Example**: AGM selected, but using flooded lead-acid
- AGM voltage too low for FLA → chronic undercharge → sulfation
- Battery life cut in half

**✓ Solution**: Double-check settings match installed battery chemistry

---

### ❌ **Mistake 5**: No temperature sensor in extreme climates

**Result**:
- Cold climate: Undercharging (voltage too low for cold batteries)
- Hot climate: Overcharging, gassing, water loss

**✓ Solution**: Always install sensor if controller supports it (marginal cost, major benefit)

---

### ❌ **Mistake 6**: Ignoring absorption time

**Symptom**: Battery never reaches 100% SoC, capacity fades over time

**Cause**: Absorption time too short (battery needs 2+ hours at absorption voltage)

**✓ Solution**: Increase absorption time setting, verify current drops to <5% of capacity before float

---

## Troubleshoot Flow

### No Charging (Array Voltage Present)

```
Battery voltage displayed? 
  ├─ NO → Check battery connections, fuses, polarity
  └─ YES → Array voltage displayed?
        ├─ NO → Check array wiring, fuses, MC4 connections
        └─ YES → Charging current shown?
              ├─ NO → Check charge stage (float = low current normal)
              │       Check error codes on display
              │       Verify battery type setting
              └─ YES → System working normally!
```

---

### Low Charging Current

```
Expected: 30A, Actual: 10A

Check 1: Array voltage = Vmp? (30-40V typical)
  ├─ NO (low voltage) → Shading? Panel damage? Wiring resistance?
  └─ YES → Check 2: Battery voltage rising?
        ├─ NO → Battery sulfated (internal resistance), replace
        └─ YES → Check 3: Charge stage?
              ├─ Float → Normal (battery full)
              ├─ Absorption → Normal (current tapers in absorption)
              └─ Bulk → Problem:
- Controller temperature derating (>40°C)
- Undersized controller
- Faulty controller
```

---

### Batteries Not Reaching 100% SoC

**Symptoms**: Voltage peaks at 12.2-12.4V (should be 12.8V+)

**Diagnosis**:
1. **Check absorption time**: Should see 2+ hours at absorption voltage
- Too short → Battery never finishes charging
2. **Check absorption voltage**: 14.4-14.8V for FLA, 14.1-14.4V for Gel
- Too low → Never reaches full charge
3. **Check current taper**: Should drop to <2% of battery capacity
- High current sustained → Battery damaged or wrong settings
4. **Temperature compensation**: Cold weather requires higher voltage
- No sensor → Chronic undercharge in winter

**Fixes**:
- Increase absorption time (add 1-2 hours)
- Raise absorption voltage (0.1V increments)
- Install temperature sensor
- Test battery capacity (may need replacement if sulfated)

---

## Safety Protocols

### ⚡ Electrical Safety

**Before working on controller**:
- [ ] Open DC disconnect (array and battery)
- [ ] Cover panels with opaque material
- [ ] Verify 0V at all terminals
- [ ] Lockout/tagout disconnect switches

**Arc flash risk**:
- Controllers can sustain arc if disconnected under load

---

### 🔥 Fire Prevention

**Causes of controller fires**:
- Undersized wiring (overheats, melts insulation)
- Loose connections (arcing, high resistance heating)
- Reverse polarity (instant short circuit)
- Overvoltage (cold weather Voc exceeds rating)

**Prevention**:
- Use wire gauge per manufacturer specs (or larger)
- Torque terminals to specification
- Test polarity before connecting array
