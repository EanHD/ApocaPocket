# Generator Maintenance

## Overview

Proper maintenance ensures reliable generator operation during emergencies. Neglected generators often fail when needed most—typically after months of storage. This guide covers preventive maintenance schedules, procedures, and troubleshooting for portable and standby generators.

**Critical Concept:** Generators don't fail during use—they fail at startup after long storage. Maintenance prevents failure modes: stale fuel, gummed carburetors, weak batteries, contaminated oil, and corroded connections.

## Maintenance Schedule

### Every Use (Pre-Start Inspection)

**Time Required:** 5-10 minutes

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Check engine oil level (dipstick)
- [ ] Inspect fuel level (never start on empty)
- [ ] Visual inspection for leaks (oil, fuel, coolant)
- [ ] Check air filter (no visible dirt/debris)
- [ ] Test CO detector nearby (battery-powered)
- [ ] Clear exhaust area (no combustibles within 3 feet)
- [ ] Verify position (outdoors, 20+ feet from structures)
- [ ] Extension cords inspected (no damage/cuts)

**Oil Level Check:**
1. Place generator on level surface
2. Remove dipstick, wipe clean
3. Reinsert fully (do NOT screw in for accurate reading on most units)
4. Remove and check level
5. Add oil if below "FULL" mark
6. Use correct viscosity (see specifications below)

### Every 20-50 Hours (or 3 Months)

**Time Required:** 30-45 minutes

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Change engine oil (first change at 20 hrs, then every 50 hrs)
- [ ] Inspect spark plug
- [ ] Clean/replace air filter
- [ ] Check fuel system (lines, filter, tank sediment)
- [ ] Tighten hardware (vibration loosens bolts)
- [ ] Clean cooling fins (debris blocks airflow)
- [ ] Test voltage output (multimeter)

### Every 100 Hours (or 6 Months)

**Time Required:** 1-2 hours

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Replace spark plug
- [ ] Replace air filter (if dirty)
- [ ] Replace fuel filter
- [ ] Inspect/clean fuel tank
- [ ] Check valve clearance (if adjustable)
- [ ] Load test (run under 50% load for 1 hour)
- [ ] Inspect recoil starter (rope, spring)
- [ ] Battery maintenance (standby generators)

### Annual Maintenance (or 200 Hours)

**Time Required:** 2-3 hours

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Full oil change (even if low hours)
- [ ] Replace spark plug
- [ ] Replace air filter
- [ ] Replace fuel (drain old, refill fresh + stabilizer)
- [ ] Clean carburetor (if running issues)
- [ ] Inspect/replace fuel lines (cracks, hardening)
- [ ] Load bank test (run at 75% load for 2 hours)
- [ ] Coolant check (liquid-cooled units)
- [ ] Battery load test (standby generators)
- [ ] Transfer switch test

### Seasonal Storage (3+ Months Non-Use)

**Time Required:** 45-60 minutes

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Run dry OR add stabilizer + full tank
- [ ] Change oil (combustion acids sit in crankcase)
- [ ] Remove spark plug, add oil in cylinder, pull rope (coats cylinder)
- [ ] Clean generator (remove debris, dirt)
- [ ] Cover/store in dry location
- [ ] Battery: Remove and store on maintainer OR disconnect negative
- [ ] Mice prevention (steel wool in exhaust, intake if stored indoors)

## Oil Change Procedure

### Oil Specifications

**Viscosity by Temperature:**
| Temperature Range | Recommended Oil | Alternate |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Below 32°F (0°C) | 5W-30 synthetic | 5W-20 |
| 32-80°F (0-27°C) | 10W-30 | SAE 30 |
| Above 80°F (27°C) | SAE 30 | 10W-40 |
| All temps | 5W-30 synthetic | - |

**Synthetic vs Conventional:**
- Synthetic: Better cold-start flow, longer intervals, higher cost
- Conventional: Adequate for regular use, cheaper
- Break-in: Use conventional for first 20 hours (rings seat better)

**Oil Capacity by Engine Size:**
| Engine Displacement | Oil Capacity | Common Generators |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 80-100cc | 0.4-0.5 qt | 1,000-2,000W |
| 150-200cc | 0.6-0.7 qt | 2,000-4,000W |
| 250-300cc | 0.9-1.1 qt | 4,000-6,000W |
| 350-450cc | 1.1-1.3 qt | 6,000-8,000W |
| 500-600cc | 1.4-1.6 qt | 8,000-12,000W |

**Note:** Check owner's manual for exact capacity. Overfilling causes foaming and pressure buildup. Underfilling causes starvation and seizure.

### Oil Change Steps

**Tools Needed:**
- Socket wrench (10mm or 12mm common)
- Oil drain pan (2+ quart capacity)
- Funnel
- Rags/shop towels
- Oil filter wrench (if equipped)
- Torque wrench (optional but recommended)

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes

**Procedure:**

**1. Warm Engine (5 minutes)**
- Start generator, run 3-5 minutes
- Warm oil flows faster and suspends contaminants
- DO NOT run at full temp (risk of burns)

**2. Position Generator**
- Level surface (accurate dipstick reading)
- Place drain pan under oil drain plug
- Have rags ready for drips

**3. Drain Oil**
- Remove oil fill cap (vents crankcase, improves flow)
- Remove drain plug (typically 10mm or 12mm hex)
- Let drain completely (3-5 minutes)
- Tilt generator slightly toward drain (empties sump fully)
- Inspect drained oil:
  - Black = normal carbon
  - Milky = water contamination (head gasket leak)
  - Metallic = bearing wear (serious issue)

**4. Replace Drain Plug**
- Wipe plug threads clean
- Install new crush washer if equipped
- Torque specifications:
  | Engine Size | Drain Plug Torque |
  |-------------|-------------------|
  | Small (100-200cc) | 12-15 ft-lbs |
  | Medium (200-400cc) | 15-20 ft-lbs |
  | Large (400cc+) | 20-25 ft-lbs |
- Hand-tighten, then 1/4 turn with wrench (if no torque wrench)
- **DON'T OVERTIGHTEN** - strips threads in aluminum cases

**5. Replace Oil Filter (if equipped)**
- Unscrew old filter (oil filter wrench if stuck)
- Wipe filter mounting surface clean
- Apply thin layer of oil to new filter gasket
- Screw on new filter hand-tight
- Turn additional 3/4 turn (no tools - gasket seats properly)

**6. Refill Oil**
- Pour in 75% of specified capacity
- Wait 1 minute (oil settles)
- Check dipstick
- Add remaining oil in small increments
- Final check: Level at "FULL" mark on dipstick

**7. Check for Leaks**
- Replace oil fill cap
- Start generator
- Run 2-3 minutes
- Inspect drain plug and filter (no leaks)
- Shut down
- Wait 2 minutes
- Recheck oil level (top off if needed)

**8. Dispose of Used Oil**
- Never pour in drain, trash, or ground
- Store in sealed container
- Take to auto parts store, quick-lube, or recycling center
- Most accept used oil free of charge

### Common Oil Change Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| Draining cold oil (contaminants settle) | Warm engine 5 min before draining |
| Overfilling oil (foaming, pressure) | Fill to FULL mark, not above |
| Reusing drain plug washer | Replace crush washer each change |
| Overtightening drain plug | Use torque wrench or 1/4 turn past hand-tight |
| Wrong viscosity (thick oil in cold) | Match viscosity to temperature range |
| Running old oil "just a bit longer" | Change at interval (acids corrode bearings) |
| Mixing synthetic and conventional | OK to mix, but defeats synthetic benefits |
| Not checking for leaks after change | Run 3 min, inspect drain plug/filter |

## Spark Plug Maintenance

### Spark Plug Specifications

**Plug Type by Engine:**
| Engine Type | Thread Size | Reach | Gap | Heat Range |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-----|------------|
| Small 2-stroke | 10mm | 12.7mm (1/2") | 0.024-0.028" | Hot (B6, BR6) |
| 4-stroke OHV | 14mm | 19mm (3/4") | 0.028-0.030" | Med (B8, BR8) |
| High performance | 14mm | 19mm (3/4") | 0.030-0.032" | Cold (B10, BR10) |

**Heat Range Explained:**
- Hot plugs (B6): Slow heat dissipation, prevent fouling in low-load engines
- Cold plugs (B10): Fast heat dissipation, prevent preignition in high-load engines
- Generators: Usually medium range (B8, BR8)

**Common Plug Brands:**
- NGK: BPR6ES, BPR8ES (R = resistor, E = 19mm reach, S = copper core)
- Champion: RN12YC, RJ19LM
- Autolite: 3924, 2974

**Resistor Plugs (R prefix):** Required for engines with electronic ignition. Suppresses electromagnetic interference (EMI).

### Spark Plug Inspection

**Inspection Interval:** Every 50 hours or 6 months

**Tools Needed:**
- Spark plug socket (13/16" or 5/8" with rubber insert)
- Socket wrench or ratchet
- Feeler gauge (0.020-0.040" range)
- Wire brush or plug cleaner
- Compressed air (optional)
- Anti-seize compound (optional, aluminum heads)

**Procedure:**

**1. Remove Plug**
- Disconnect spark plug wire (pull boot, not wire)
- Clean around plug base (prevent debris entering cylinder)
- Unscrew plug (counterclockwise)
- Note position of plug in engine (some multi-cylinder engines)

**2. Inspect Condition**

| Appearance | Diagnosis | Action |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Light tan/gray, dry | Normal combustion | Gap and reinstall or replace if 100+ hrs |
| Black, dry, sooty | Rich fuel mixture | Adjust carburetor, check air filter |
| Wet, black, oily | Oil fouling | Worn rings/valve seals, check oil level |
| White, blistered | Overheating | Lean mixture, wrong heat range, or cooling issues |
| Eroded electrode | Normal wear | Replace plug |
| Carbon buildup | Low-load operation | Run under load, clean plug |
| Wet with fuel | Flooded engine | Dry plug, check choke operation |

**3. Check Gap**
- Insert feeler gauge between center and ground electrode
- Correct gap: Slight drag on gauge
- Too wide: Weak spark, hard starting
- Too narrow: Weak spark, possible fouling
- Adjustment: Gently tap ground electrode to close, pry to open

**Gap Settings:**
| Engine Type | Gap Range | Typical Setting |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Magneto ignition | 0.024-0.028" | 0.025" |
| Electronic ignition | 0.028-0.032" | 0.030" |
| CDI ignition | 0.030-0.035" | 0.032" |

**4. Clean Plug (if reusing)**
- Wire brush around electrode (remove carbon)
- Compressed air in reverse direction (blow out debris)
- Never sandblast (embeds abrasive in ceramic)
- Inspect ceramic for cracks (replace if damaged)

**5. Install Plug**
- Apply anti-seize to threads (aluminum heads only, 2 threads)
  - **Do NOT use** on steel heads or taper seat plugs
- Start by hand (prevent cross-threading)
- Tighten specifications:
  | Thread Size | With Gasket | Taper Seat (no gasket) |
  |-------------|-------------|------------------------|
  | 10mm | 10-12 ft-lbs | 10-15 ft-lbs |
  | 14mm | 18-22 ft-lbs | 15-20 ft-lbs |
  | 18mm | 25-30 ft-lbs | 20-25 ft-lbs |
- Without torque wrench (gasket seat):
  - Finger-tight until gasket contacts
  - Turn 1/2 turn (90°) additional
- Reconnect spark plug wire (push until clicks)

### Spark Plug Replacement

**Replacement Interval:** Every 100 hours or annually

**Why Replace:**
- Electrode erosion (gap widens, weak spark)
- Ceramic cracking (leaks voltage, misfires)
- Carbon buildup (bridging = no spark)
- Cost vs reliability: $2-5 plug vs towing/repair

**Installation Tips:**
- Use correct part number (wrong heat range causes issues)
- Never reuse gasket (doesn't reseal properly)
- Thread damage: Use thread chaser (14mm x 1.25 pitch common)
- Keep spares (2-3 plugs in emergency kit)

## Air Filter Maintenance

### Filter Types

**Foam Filter (Oil-Bath):**
- Washable/reusable
- Oiled foam traps fine particles
- Common in small engines
- Service interval: 25-50 hours

**Paper Filter (Dry):**
- Disposable (some can be blown clean)
- Finer filtration than foam
- Common in larger generators
- Replace: 50-100 hours or when visibly dirty

**Dual-Stage (Foam + Paper):**
- Foam pre-cleaner (large particles)
- Paper element (fine particles)
- Both require maintenance
- Foam: Clean every 25 hrs, Paper: Replace 100 hrs

### Foam Filter Cleaning

**Tools/Materials:**
- Dish soap or air filter cleaner
- Water
- Clean rags
- Paper towels
- Air filter oil (specific product, NOT motor oil)

**Procedure:**

**1. Remove Filter**
- Release air filter cover (wing nut or clips)
- Remove foam element
- Inspect housing for debris

**2. Wash Filter**
- Warm water + dish soap
- Squeeze repeatedly (work soap through foam)
- DO NOT twist or wring (tears foam)
- Rinse until water runs clear
- Squeeze excess water out

**3. Dry Filter**
- Air dry completely (1-2 hours)
- OR squeeze in paper towels
- Must be 100% dry before oiling

**4. Oil Filter**
- Apply air filter oil (NOT motor oil)
- Knead oil through foam evenly
- Entire filter should be light red/blue (oil color)
- Squeeze out excess oil (should not drip)

**5. Reinstall**
- Inspect filter sealing surface (foam integrity)
- Seat fully in housing (air leaks = dirty carb)
- Secure cover

**Why Oil the Filter:**
- Dry foam: Poor filtration (dust passes through)
- Oiled foam: Sticky surface traps particles
- Motor oil: Too thick, restricts airflow
- Proper air filter oil: Correct viscosity

### Paper Filter Maintenance

**Inspection:** Every 25-50 hours
**Replacement:** 100 hours or visibly dirty

**Cleaning (Emergency Only):**
- Tap filter on solid surface (knocks loose dust)
- Compressed air from inside-out (blow dirt out)
  - Max 30 PSI pressure (higher tears paper)
  - Never from outside-in (embeds dirt in paper)
- NOT a substitute for replacement
- 2-3 cleanings maximum (filter breaks down)

**Replacement Signs:**
- Dark gray/black appearance
- Oily contamination (engine blowby)
- Torn or damaged paper
- Rubber gasket hardened/cracked

**Installation:**
- Wipe housing clean (no dust)
- Check gasket seating surface
- Do NOT over-tighten wing nut (warps housing)

### Air Filter Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Black smoke | Restricted air filter | Clean or replace filter |
| Poor performance | Dirty filter (rich mixture) | Service filter |
| Engine surging | Air leak around filter | Check filter seating |
| Fuel in air filter | Float needle stuck | Rebuild carburetor |
| Backfire through intake | Lean mixture or valve issue | Check filter restriction, valve clearance |

## Fuel System Maintenance

### Fuel Stabilizer

**Purpose:**
- Prevents fuel oxidation (gum/varnish formation)
- Keeps fuel fresh 12-24 months
- Protects carburetor from deposits

**When to Use:**
- ALWAYS when storing generator >30 days
- Add to fuel can immediately after purchase
- Mix thoroughly before adding to tank

**Dosage:**
| Stabilizer Brand | Treatment Ratio | Cost |
|------------------|-----------------|------|
| STA-BIL | 1 oz per 2.5 gal | $10/16 oz |
| PRI-G | 1 oz per 16 gal | $25/16 oz |
| Star Tron | 1 oz per 16 gal | $12/8 oz |

**Application:**
1. Add stabilizer to empty gas can
2. Fill with fresh gasoline
3. Shake or swirl to mix
4. Add to generator tank
5. Run generator 5-10 minutes (cycles treated fuel through system)

**Stabilizer Does NOT:**
- Fix old/bad fuel (add before degradation)
- Clean existing carburetor deposits (use cleaner)
- Last indefinitely (fuel still degrades slowly)

### Carburetor Cleaning (External)

**Interval:** Annually or if running issues

**Symptoms Requiring Carb Service:**
- Hard starting (pulls many times)
- Runs then dies after 5-10 seconds
- Surging (RPM hunting up/down)
- Black smoke (rich mixture)
- Poor throttle response

**External Cleaning (Preventive):**

**Tools/Materials:**
- Carburetor cleaner spray
- Small wire brush
- Compressed air
- Clean rags

**Procedure:**
1. Remove air filter assembly
2. Spray carb cleaner around throttle plate and linkage
3. Work throttle manually (cleaner penetrates)
4. Spray choke mechanism (if equipped)
5. Let soak 5 minutes
6. Wipe excess cleaner
7. Compressed air through passages
8. Reinstall air filter

**Internal Cleaning (Rebuild):**
- See Small Engine Repair entry (l3-tech-small-engine-repair.md)
- Requires disassembly, jet cleaning, float adjustment
- Time: 1-2 hours for experienced technician

### Fuel Tank Maintenance

**Inspection:** Annually

**Sediment Removal:**
1. Drain fuel completely
2. Pour small amount (1 cup) fresh fuel in tank
3. Swirl and shake vigorously
4. Drain sediment out
5. Repeat until clean
6. Inspect for rust (metal tanks)

**Rust Treatment (Metal Tanks):**
- Pour in rust remover (Evaporust, Metal Rescue)
- Let sit 24 hours
- Drain and rinse
- Dry completely (compressed air)
- Optional: Fuel tank sealer (coats inside, prevents rust)

**Plastic Tanks:**
- No rust, but can crack from ethanol
- Inspect for cracks, especially around fuel outlet
- Replace if damaged (no repair possible)

### Fuel Line Inspection

**Check for:**
- Cracks (especially where bends)
- Hardening (fuel line becomes stiff)
- Softening (ethanol deterioration)
- Leaks at connections

**Replacement:**
- Standard size: 1/4" ID (5/16" OD) fuel line
- Ethanol-resistant line preferred
- Use fuel line clamps (not hose clamps - too much pressure)
- Cut length +1" extra (allows future re-trim)

**Installation:**
1. Shut off fuel valve
2. Cut old line, note routing
3. Clean tank/carburetor fittings
4. Push new line on fittings (warm in hot water = easier)
5. Install clamps 1/4" from end
6. Open fuel valve, check for leaks

## Load Testing

### Purpose of Load Testing

**Why Load Test:**
- Identifies problems before emergency
- Exercises generator under realistic conditions
- Prevents "wet stacking" (diesel generators)
- Tests voltage regulation under load
- Confirms transfer switch operation

**Wet Stacking (Diesel):**
- Occurs when diesel runs at <40% load for extended periods
- Incomplete combustion deposits unburned fuel in exhaust
- Symptoms: Black smoke, poor performance, carbon buildup
- Prevention: Run at 50-75% load monthly

### Monthly Exercise Run

**Frequency:** Every 30 days minimum

**Procedure:**
1. Pre-start inspection (oil, fuel, leaks)
2. Start generator (normal procedure)
3. Run no-load 5 minutes (warm-up)
4. Apply load (see load methods below)
5. Run under 50% load for 30 minutes minimum
6. Remove load gradually
7. Run no-load 3 minutes (cool-down)
8. Shut down
9. Record runtime in log (track hours for maintenance)

**Load Methods:**
- Space heaters (1,500W each)
- Electric water heater (turn on breaker)
- Electric range (use burners)
- Shop tools (heaters, compressors)
- Load bank (professional tool)

**Target Load:**
| Generator Size | 50% Load | Equipment Example |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| 3,500W | 1,750W | One 1,500W heater + lights |
| 5,000W | 2,500W | Two 1,500W heaters |
| 7,500W | 3,750W | Two 1,500W heaters + fridge |
| 10,000W | 5,000W | Three 1,500W heaters + fridge |

### Load Bank Testing

**Professional Testing:** Annually or biannually

**What is a Load Bank:**
- Resistive heaters in portable chassis
- Adjustable load (usually in 500W or 1kW increments)
- Amperage/voltage meters
- Tests generator to full rated capacity

**Test Procedure:**
1. Start generator, warm 10 minutes
2. Apply 25% load (e.g., 2,500W on 10kW generator)
3. Run 15 minutes, record voltage/frequency
4. Increase to 50% load
5. Run 30 minutes, record voltage/frequency
6. Increase to 75% load
7. Run 30 minutes, record voltage/frequency
8. Increase to 100% load
9. Run 60 minutes (stress test)
10. Reduce load gradually
11. Cool-down 10 minutes
12. Shut down

**Pass Criteria:**
| Parameter | Acceptable Range |
|-----------|------------------|
| Voltage (120V) | 114-126V (±5%) |
| Voltage (240V) | 228-252V (±5%) |
| Frequency | 59-61 Hz (±1 Hz) |
| Temperature rise | Not exceeding spec (typically <200°F) |

**Failure Indicators:**
- Voltage drops >5% under load
- Frequency unstable (hunting)
- Excessive smoke
- Engine stalling under load
- Overheating (automatic shutdown)

**Load Bank Rental:**
- Equipment rental stores: $50-100/day
- Cost-effective for annual test vs service call ($200-400)

### Voltage Testing (Without Load Bank)

**Tools:**
- Digital multimeter
- Known loads (space heaters, tools)

**Procedure:**
1. Start generator, run 5 minutes (stabilize)
2. Set multimeter to AC voltage (V~)
3. Insert probes into outlet (black = neutral slot, red = hot slot)
4. Record voltage no-load
5. Apply load (plug in space heater)
6. Record voltage under load
7. Remove load
8. Record recovery voltage

**Expected Results:**
| Condition | Voltage Range | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| No load | 120-125V | Normal (slight high voltage OK) |
| Under load | 115-120V | Normal (slight drop OK) |
| Heavy load | 110-115V | Acceptable (5-10% drop) |
| Any condition | <108V or >132V | Problem (investigate) |

## Battery Maintenance (Standby Generators)

### Battery Specifications

**Standby generators:** 12V automotive-style battery

**Types:**
- Lead-acid flooded: Cheapest, requires water checks
- AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat): Maintenance-free, longer life, higher cost
- Gel cell: Maintenance-free, cold-weather performance

**Replacement Interval:**
- Flooded: 3-5 years
- AGM: 5-7 years
- Failure symptoms: Slow cranking, no start, clicking relay

### Battery Testing

**Frequency:** Every 6 months

**Voltage Test (Resting):**
1. Battery disconnected or no load for 2+ hours
2. Multimeter on DC voltage (V⎓)
3. Red probe to positive terminal, black to negative
4. Read voltage:
   | Voltage | State of Charge |
   |---------|-----------------|
   | 12.6V+ | 100% |
   | 12.4V | 75% |
   | 12.2V | 50% |
   | 12.0V | 25% |
   | <11.9V | Discharged (recharge immediately) |

**Load Test:**
- Apply load equal to half CCA rating for 15 seconds
- Voltage should not drop below 9.6V
- Requires load tester or carbon pile tester
- Battery failing if drops below threshold

**Charging System Test:**
1. Start generator
2. Measure voltage at battery terminals
3. Should read 13.8-14.4V (charging)
4. If <13.5V: Charging system problem
5. If >14.5V: Overcharging (regulator issue)

### Battery Maintenance

**Flooded Batteries:**
- Check water level every 3-6 months
- Add distilled water only (not tap water)
- Fill to 1/4" below cap opening (not overfilled)
- Never add acid (water evaporates, acid doesn't)

**All Battery Types:**
- Clean terminals (corrosion reduces current flow)
- Wire brush terminals and cable clamps
- Apply dielectric grease or anti-corrosion spray
- Check cable tightness (hand-tight, no movement)
- Inspect cables for fraying, cracks

**Trickle Charging (Seasonal Storage):**
- Battery maintainer (NOT standard charger)
- 1-2 amp charge rate
- Automatic shutoff when full
- Prevents sulfation during long storage

## Transfer Switch Testing

**Frequency:** Annually

**Manual Transfer Switch:**
1. Simulate outage (turn off main breaker)
2. Start generator
3. Flip transfer switch to GENERATOR
4. Verify selected circuits powered
5. Check for proper grounding (no tingle on appliances)
6. Return switch to UTILITY
7. Turn on main breaker

**Automatic Transfer Switch:**
1. Simulate outage (turn off main breaker)
2. ATS should signal generator to start (10-30 seconds)
3. Generator starts and stabilizes
4. ATS transfers load to generator
5. Verify house powered by generator
6. Turn main breaker back on
7. ATS should transfer back to utility after 30-60 seconds
8. Generator runs cool-down cycle (1-3 minutes)
9. Generator shuts down

**Failure Modes:**
- Generator doesn't start (battery dead, fuel shutoff, low oil shutdown)
- ATS doesn't transfer (control circuit failure, low voltage)
- Generator starts but no power (overload, circuit breaker tripped)
- Won't transfer back to utility (ATS relay stuck)

## Maintenance Log

**Track These Metrics:**
- Date of service
- Engine hours (use hour meter or estimate)
- Oil changed (Y/N)
- Oil type/amount
- Spark plug (cleaned/replaced)
- Air filter (cleaned/replaced)
- Fuel added/drained
- Load test performed (Y/N)
- Notes (problems, repairs)

**Sample Log Format:**
```
Date       Hours   Oil Change   Spark Plug   Air Filter   Fuel      Load Test   Notes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2026-01-15   20    Yes (10W30)  Inspected    Cleaned      Fresh     No          First change
2026-02-12   30    No           No           No           Topped off Yes (30min) Monthly exercise
2026-03-10   40    No           No           No           Topped off Yes (30min) Monthly exercise
2026-04-15   60    Yes (10W30)  Replaced     Replaced     Fresh     Yes (1hr)   Seasonal service
```

## Common Maintenance Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✓ Right |
|---------|---------|
| "It started, so it's fine" (no load test) | Run under load monthly (identifies problems) |
| Using automotive oil in air-cooled engines | Use small engine oil (higher zinc, detergents) |
| Letting fuel sit all season | Run dry or add stabilizer immediately |
| Checking oil with engine running | Shut down, wait 2 min, check on level surface |
| Overtightening spark plug | Torque spec or 1/2 turn past gasket contact |
| Washing air filter with gasoline | Use soap and water (gasoline breaks down foam) |
| Never exercising generator between outages | Monthly 30-min run under load minimum |
| Assuming battery is good (starts car) | Load test annually (generators need high CCA) |
| Draining carb but leaving fuel in tank | Empty tank OR keep full with stabilizer |
| Skipping oil change "just a few more hours" | Change at interval (acids corrode bearings) |

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Check/Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Won't start (no spark) | Dead spark plug | Remove, inspect, test for spark |
| Won't start (flooded) | Choke stuck closed | Open choke, remove plug, air-dry |
| Starts then dies | Old fuel, clogged carb | Drain, clean carb, fresh fuel |
| Black smoke | Rich mixture (dirty air filter) | Clean/replace air filter |
| White/blue smoke | Burning oil (worn rings) | Check oil level, likely needs rebuild |
| Low power under load | Dirty carb, old fuel, air leak | Clean carb, check air filter seating |
| High voltage (>130V) | AVR failure | Replace voltage regulator |
| Low voltage (<110V) | Overloaded or AVR issue | Reduce load, test AVR |
| Surging RPM | Governor issue or air leak | Adjust governor, check for intake leaks |
| Oil in air filter | Overfilled, worn rings | Drain to proper level, compression test |
