# Potato Cultivation & Storage

## Overview
Potatoes are high-yield staples with strong calorie return and practical storage potential.

## Planting Basics
- Use healthy seed potatoes with viable eyes.
- Typical spacing: 25–30 cm (10–12 in) in-row, 75–90 cm (30–36 in) between rows.
- Plant depth commonly ~10 cm (4 in), adjusted for soil/climate.

## Hilling and Canopy Management
- Hill soil as plants grow to protect tubers from light.
- Exposed tubers turn green (glycoalkaloid risk) and should not be eaten.

## Water and Nutrition
- Keep soil evenly moist; avoid waterlogging.
- Potassium demand is significant in many soils.
- Avoid excessive late nitrogen (reduces tuber quality/storage).

## Pest and Disease Watch
- Colorado potato beetle pressure in many regions.
- Late blight risk in cool/wet conditions.
- Remove and isolate diseased plants quickly.

## Harvest Timing
- New potatoes: early, before full skin set.
- Storage crop: harvest after vine dieback and skin set.
- Cure in dark, ventilated area before long-term storage.

## Storage Targets
- Cool, dark, humid, ventilated conditions.
- Remove damaged tubers from storage batch.
- Inspect periodically for rot/sprouting.

## Common Mistakes
- Exposed tubers (greening/toxicity).
- Storing wet potatoes (rot risk).
- Mixing damaged and healthy tubers.

## Summary
With good hilling, disease monitoring, and storage discipline, potatoes provide dependable staple calories.
