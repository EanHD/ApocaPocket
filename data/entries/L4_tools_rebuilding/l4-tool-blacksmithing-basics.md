summary: 'Blacksmithing is the most critical rebuilding skill — it produces tools, hardware, weapons, and repairs. A basic forge can be built from clay and a pipe. Master four operations: drawing out, upsetting,
  bending, and punching, and you can make almost anything from steel.'
warnings:
- Hot steel looks identical to cold steel — always assume metal near a forge is hot enough to cause severe burns
- Forge temperatures exceed 1000°C — keep water bucket nearby for quenching AND for burns
- Flying scale (oxide flakes) and sparks can ignite clothing and cause eye injuries — wear eye protection and natural fiber clothing (cotton/wool, NOT synthetic — synthetics melt into skin)
- Carbon monoxide from forge fires is lethal — ALWAYS work in well-ventilated area or outdoors
steps:
- 'FORGE CONSTRUCTION: simplest forge is a ground forge — dig a bowl-shaped pit 12 inches diameter, 6 inches deep. Line with clay. Run a pipe (metal or clay) from the side at the bottom — this is the tuyere
  (air inlet). Connect to bellows or blower. Fill with charcoal. This is identical to forges used for thousands of years.'
- 'ANVIL ALTERNATIVES: ideal is a real anvil (100+ lbs), but alternatives work: large flat rock (granite is best), section of railroad rail, thick steel plate, back of an axe head sunk in a stump, any heavy
  piece of steel with a flat face. The anvil must be HEAVY (resist hammer blows) and at knuckle height.'
- 'HEAT COLORS (critical knowledge): Black = cold (<400°C). Dark red = 450°C (barely workable). Cherry red = 750°C (good working heat). Bright orange = 900°C (ideal for most work). Yellow = 1050°C (welding
  heat, near maximum). White = 1200°C+ (burning the steel — too hot, you''re destroying it). Work steel in the orange range.'
- 'DRAWING OUT (making metal longer/thinner): heat to bright orange, hammer with blows angled slightly to push metal lengthwise. Rotate 90° every few blows to keep cross-section even. This is how you make
  points, tapers, and blades. Use the horn (round end) of the anvil for tapering.'
- 'UPSETTING (making metal shorter/thicker): heat only the END you want to thicken. Stand the piece vertically and hammer DOWN on the top. The hot end compresses and swells while the cold section stays
  unchanged. Used for making bolt heads, nail heads, and thickening joints.'
- 'BENDING: heat the specific area where you want the bend. Place on anvil edge and hammer the overhanging section down. For sharp bends: use the anvil edge. For curves: use the horn. For rings: wrap around
  the horn. All bends should be made at bright orange heat.'
- 'PUNCHING (making holes): heat metal to orange, place over the pritchel hole (small round hole in anvil face) or over open space at anvil edge. Drive a punch (thick pointed steel rod) partway through
  from one side, flip, and drive from the other side until they meet. This makes cleaner holes than drilling.'
- 'BASIC PROJECTS (in order of difficulty): (1) S-hook — practice drawing, bending, and scrolling. (2) Nail — practice drawing to a point and heading. (3) Chisel — practice drawing and heat treatment. (4)
  Knife — combines all skills plus grinding and heat treatment.'
- 'HEAT TREATMENT — HARDENING: heat finished tool to cherry red (non-magnetic — test with a magnet if available). Quench in oil (vegetable oil or motor oil) for knives/blades, or water for punches/chisels.
  Steel becomes glass-hard but brittle.'
- 'HEAT TREATMENT — TEMPERING: immediately after hardening, polish one flat surface with sandstone until shiny. Heat gently (near coals, not in them) and watch oxide colors appear on the polished surface:
  Pale yellow (220°C) = razors, engraving tools. Straw yellow (240°C) = knives, chisels. Brown (260°C) = axes, scissors. Blue (300°C) = springs, saws. When desired color reaches the cutting edge, quench
  immediately.'
