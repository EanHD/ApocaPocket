summary: Hand-building pottery using coil and slab methods without a potter's wheel.
steps:
- 'Gather and process clay: dig, remove stones and roots, add water to make workable
  consistency.'
- Temper clay by mixing in fine sand or crushed shell (~20%) to prevent cracking during
  firing.
- 'Coil method: roll clay ropes, stack in circles, smooth joints inside and out.'
- 'Slab method: roll clay flat, cut pieces, join with slip (clay+water paste) and
  scoring.'
- 'Pinch method: start with a ball, pinch and rotate to form a bowl shape.'
- Dry slowly in shade for several days—rapid drying causes cracking.
- Fire in pit kiln or open fire—heat slowly, then bring to full temperature for 1–2
  hours.
warnings:
- Pots explode if moisture remains when fired—ensure thorough drying.
- Air bubbles in clay can cause explosive failure during firing—wedge (knead) clay
  thoroughly.

## Overview
Hand-building pottery using coil and slab methods without a potter's wheel.

## Step-by-step
1. Gather and process clay: dig, remove stones and roots, add water to make workable consistency.
2. Temper clay by mixing in fine sand or crushed shell (~20%) to prevent cracking during firing.
3. Coil method: roll clay ropes, stack in circles, smooth joints inside and out.
4. Slab method: roll clay flat, cut pieces, join with slip (clay+water paste) and scoring.
5. Pinch method: start with a ball, pinch and rotate to form a bowl shape.
6. Dry slowly in shade for several days—rapid drying causes cracking.
7. Fire in pit kiln or open fire—heat slowly, then bring to full temperature for 1–2 hours.

## Warnings
- Pots explode if moisture remains when fired—ensure thorough drying.
- Air bubbles in clay can cause explosive failure during firing—wedge (knead) clay thoroughly.
