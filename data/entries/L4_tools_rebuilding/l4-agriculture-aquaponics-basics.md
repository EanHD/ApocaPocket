steps:
- 'Principle: fish waste (ammonia) → bacteria convert to nitrate → plants absorb nitrate
  → clean water returns to fish.'
- 'Fish tank: any waterproof container. Stock with hardy species (tilapia, catfish,
  carp).'
- 'Grow bed: gravel or clay pebble filled container above or beside fish tank.'
- Pump water from fish tank to grow bed; gravity returns it to fish tank.
- Cycle takes 4–6 weeks to establish beneficial bacteria before adding fish.
- Feed fish daily; plants get nutrients from fish waste—minimal additional fertilizer
  needed.
- Monitor pH (target 6.8–7.2) and ammonia levels, especially during startup.
warnings:
- Power failure kills fish quickly—have backup aeration plan.
- System crash from pH or ammonia spike can kill all fish in hours—monitor regularly.
- Not all fish species tolerate crowded/warm conditions—research local options.

## Overview
Basic aquaponics systems combining fish raising with soilless plant cultivation in a symbiotic cycle.

## Step-by-step
1. Principle: fish waste (ammonia) → bacteria convert to nitrate → plants absorb nitrate → clean water returns to fish.
2. Fish tank: any waterproof container. Stock with hardy species (tilapia, catfish, carp).
3. Grow bed: gravel or clay pebble filled container above or beside fish tank.
4. Pump water from fish tank to grow bed; gravity returns it to fish tank.
5. Cycle takes 4–6 weeks to establish beneficial bacteria before adding fish.
6. Feed fish daily; plants get nutrients from fish waste—minimal additional fertilizer needed.
7. Monitor pH (target 6.8–7.2) and ammonia levels, especially during startup.

## Warnings
- Power failure kills fish quickly—have backup aeration plan.
- System crash from pH or ammonia spike can kill all fish in hours—monitor regularly.
- Not all fish species tolerate crowded/warm conditions—research local options.
