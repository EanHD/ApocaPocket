summary: Simple loom construction and basketry techniques for making fabric, mats,
  and containers.
steps:
- 'Frame loom: build a rectangular frame, string warp threads top to bottom under
  tension.'
- Weave weft threads over-under through warp using a shuttle or by hand.
- 'Plain weave (tabby): alternating over-under pattern—simplest and most durable.'
- 'Twill weave: offset pattern creates diagonal lines—more flexible fabric.'
- 'Basketry: use willow, reed, or split wood strips; start with a base cross pattern,
  weave outward in spiral.'
- 'Coiled basketry: wrap a core (grass bundle) with a binding strip, stitching each
  coil to the one below.'
- Keep materials damp while working—dry fibers crack and break.

## Overview
Simple loom construction and basketry techniques for making fabric, mats, and containers.

## Step-by-step
1. Frame loom: build a rectangular frame, string warp threads top to bottom under tension.
2. Weave weft threads over-under through warp using a shuttle or by hand.
3. Plain weave (tabby): alternating over-under pattern—simplest and most durable.
4. Twill weave: offset pattern creates diagonal lines—more flexible fabric.
5. Basketry: use willow, reed, or split wood strips; start with a base cross pattern, weave outward in spiral.
6. Coiled basketry: wrap a core (grass bundle) with a binding strip, stitching each coil to the one below.
7. Keep materials damp while working—dry fibers crack and break.
