## Overview
Building and using simple mechanical generators to produce electricity from human or water power.

## Step-by-step
1. A generator converts mechanical rotation into electricity via electromagnetic induction.
2. Salvage motors from appliances (car alternators, power tool motors)—most work as generators when spun.
3. Bicycle generator: mount rear wheel on a stand, connect to motor/alternator via friction drive or belt.
4. Pedaling at moderate pace typically produces 50–100 watts.
5. Hand-crank: gear up rotation (small gear driving large gear on generator) for usable voltage.
6. Connect output through a bridge rectifier (if AC) and voltage regulator to charge batteries.
7. Match generator output voltage to battery system (12V is most common).

## Warnings
- Spinning generators have exposed moving parts—guard against entanglement.
- Unregulated generator output can damage batteries and electronics.
- Car alternators need initial field current to start generating—provide from a small battery.
