summary: Constructing bow drills and pump drills for fire-starting, hole-drilling,
  and rotary work.
steps:
- 'Bow drill components: bow (curved stick + cordage), spindle (straight hardwood),
  fireboard (softwood), handhold (hardwood/stone).'
- Carve a notch in the fireboard to collect hot dust; the spindle socket should be
  a small depression.
- Wrap cordage once around spindle; press down with handhold while sawing bow back
  and forth.
- 'For fire: continue until ember forms in notch dust, transfer to tinder bundle,
  blow to flame.'
- 'Pump drill: add a flywheel (heavy stone disc) to spindle, wrap cord from crossbar—push
  down and let momentum re-wind.'
- Pump drills excel at drilling holes in shell, bone, wood, and soft stone.
- Attach stone or metal bits to spindle tip for drilling applications.
warnings:
- Bow drill fire-starting requires practice—expect many attempts before first success.
- Handhold can heat up—use hardwood, stone, or lubricate with earwax/oil.

## Overview
Constructing bow drills and pump drills for fire-starting, hole-drilling, and rotary work.

## Step-by-step
1. Bow drill components: bow (curved stick + cordage), spindle (straight hardwood), fireboard (softwood), handhold (hardwood/stone).
2. Carve a notch in the fireboard to collect hot dust; the spindle socket should be a small depression.
3. Wrap cordage once around spindle; press down with handhold while sawing bow back and forth.
4. For fire: continue until ember forms in notch dust, transfer to tinder bundle, blow to flame.
5. Pump drill: add a flywheel (heavy stone disc) to spindle, wrap cord from crossbar—push down and let momentum re-wind.
6. Pump drills excel at drilling holes in shell, bone, wood, and soft stone.
7. Attach stone or metal bits to spindle tip for drilling applications.

## Warnings
- Bow drill fire-starting requires practice—expect many attempts before first success.
- Handhold can heat up—use hardwood, stone, or lubricate with earwax/oil.
