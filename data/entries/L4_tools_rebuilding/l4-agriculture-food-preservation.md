summary: 'Core food preservation techniques: drying, smoking, salting, fermentation,
  canning, and root cellaring.'
steps:
- 'Drying: slice food thin, dry in sun, over fire, or in low oven. Below 15% moisture
  prevents spoilage.'
- 'Smoking: expose to wood smoke for hours/days—smoke contains antimicrobial compounds.'
- 'Salting: pack in salt or soak in strong brine—salt draws moisture and inhibits
  bacteria.'
- 'Fermentation: submerge vegetables in salt brine (2–5%)—beneficial lactobacillus
  bacteria preserve and add nutrition.'
- 'Canning: heat food in sealed jars to kill microorganisms. Low-acid foods (meat,
  vegetables) REQUIRE pressure canning.'
- 'Root cellar: store root crops, apples, cabbage in cool (1–10°C), humid, dark, ventilated
  underground space.'
- 'Combine methods for greater safety: smoke AND salt, dry AND store in sealed container.'
warnings:
- Botulism risk in improperly canned low-acid foods—deadly toxin with no taste/smell.
- Always pressure-can low-acid foods; water bath only for high-acid (fruit, pickles,
  tomatoes with added acid).
- Spoiled preserved food may look and smell normal—when in doubt, discard.

## Overview
Core food preservation techniques: drying, smoking, salting, fermentation, canning, and root cellaring.

## Step-by-step
1. Drying: slice food thin, dry in sun, over fire, or in low oven. Below 15% moisture prevents spoilage.
2. Smoking: expose to wood smoke for hours/days—smoke contains antimicrobial compounds.
3. Salting: pack in salt or soak in strong brine—salt draws moisture and inhibits bacteria.
4. Fermentation: submerge vegetables in salt brine (2–5%)—beneficial lactobacillus bacteria preserve and add nutrition.
5. Canning: heat food in sealed jars to kill microorganisms. Low-acid foods (meat, vegetables) REQUIRE pressure canning.
6. Root cellar: store root crops, apples, cabbage in cool (1–10°C), humid, dark, ventilated underground space.
7. Combine methods for greater safety: smoke AND salt, dry AND store in sealed container.

## Warnings
- Botulism risk in improperly canned low-acid foods—deadly toxin with no taste/smell.
- Always pressure-can low-acid foods; water bath only for high-acid (fruit, pickles, tomatoes with added acid).
- Spoiled preserved food may look and smell normal—when in doubt, discard.
