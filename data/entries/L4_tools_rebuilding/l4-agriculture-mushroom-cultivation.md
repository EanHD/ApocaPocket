summary: Growing edible mushrooms on logs and prepared substrates without commercial
  equipment.
steps:
- 'Log method: drill holes in fresh-cut hardwood logs, insert mushroom spawn (plug
  spawn), seal with wax.'
- 'Best log species: oak, maple, beech, birch. Cut in dormant season, inoculate within
  2 months.'
- Stack inoculated logs in shaded, moist location. First harvest in 6–18 months.
- 'Substrate method: pasteurize straw or sawdust (soak in hot water 60–80°C for 1
  hour).'
- Mix cooled substrate with grain spawn in bags or buckets with air holes.
- Keep in warm (20–25°C), humid, shaded location during colonization (2–4 weeks).
- 'Fruiting: increase air flow, light, and humidity. Harvest when caps are fully open
  but before spore drop.'
- Oyster mushrooms and shiitake are best beginner species—forgiving and productive.
warnings:
- NEVER eat wild mushrooms based on cultivation knowledge alone—cultivation and wild
  ID are different skills.
- Contamination (green/black mold) means discard that batch—do not harvest.
- Mushroom spores can cause respiratory irritation in enclosed spaces—ventilate fruiting
  area.

## Overview
Growing edible mushrooms on logs and prepared substrates without commercial equipment.

## Step-by-step
1. Log method: drill holes in fresh-cut hardwood logs, insert mushroom spawn (plug spawn), seal with wax.
2. Best log species: oak, maple, beech, birch. Cut in dormant season, inoculate within 2 months.
3. Stack inoculated logs in shaded, moist location. First harvest in 6–18 months.
4. Substrate method: pasteurize straw or sawdust (soak in hot water 60–80°C for 1 hour).
5. Mix cooled substrate with grain spawn in bags or buckets with air holes.
6. Keep in warm (20–25°C), humid, shaded location during colonization (2–4 weeks).
7. Fruiting: increase air flow, light, and humidity. Harvest when caps are fully open but before spore drop.
8. Oyster mushrooms and shiitake are best beginner species—forgiving and productive.

## Warnings
- NEVER eat wild mushrooms based on cultivation knowledge alone—cultivation and wild ID are different skills.
- Contamination (green/black mold) means discard that batch—do not harvest.
- Mushroom spores can cause respiratory irritation in enclosed spaces—ventilate fruiting area.
