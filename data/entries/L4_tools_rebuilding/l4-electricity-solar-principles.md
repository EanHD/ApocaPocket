steps:
- PV panels convert sunlight directly to DC electricity via semiconductor junctions.
- 'Angle panels toward the sun: tilt angle ≈ your latitude for year-round average.'
- Orient panels due south (northern hemisphere) or due north (southern hemisphere).
- Keep panels clean—dust, leaves, and bird droppings significantly reduce output.
- Wire panels in series to increase voltage, in parallel to increase current.
- Use a charge controller between panels and batteries to prevent overcharging.
- Store energy in deep-cycle batteries (lead-acid or lithium); use an inverter for
  AC loads.
warnings:
- PV panels produce electricity in any light—cover panels before working on wiring.
- Battery banks store dangerous energy—short circuits cause fires and explosions.
- Broken panels may expose hazardous materials—handle with gloves.

## Overview
How photovoltaic panels work, optimal placement, and maintenance for long-term power generation.

## Step-by-step
1. PV panels convert sunlight directly to DC electricity via semiconductor junctions.
2. Angle panels toward the sun: tilt angle ≈ your latitude for year-round average.
3. Orient panels due south (northern hemisphere) or due north (southern hemisphere).
4. Keep panels clean—dust, leaves, and bird droppings significantly reduce output.
5. Wire panels in series to increase voltage, in parallel to increase current.
6. Use a charge controller between panels and batteries to prevent overcharging.
7. Store energy in deep-cycle batteries (lead-acid or lithium); use an inverter for AC loads.

## Warnings
- PV panels produce electricity in any light—cover panels before working on wiring.
- Battery banks store dangerous energy—short circuits cause fires and explosions.
- Broken panels may expose hazardous materials—handle with gloves.
