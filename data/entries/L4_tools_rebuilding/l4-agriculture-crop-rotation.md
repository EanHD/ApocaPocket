summary: Planning crop rotation by plant family to maintain soil fertility and reduce
  pest/disease pressure.
steps:
- 'Group crops by family: legumes (beans, peas), nightshades (tomato, pepper), brassicas
  (cabbage, broccoli), cucurbits (squash), alliums (onion, garlic), grains.'
- 'Basic 4-year rotation: legumes → brassicas → nightshades/cucurbits → root crops/grains.'
- Legumes fix nitrogen—plant before heavy feeders (brassicas, corn).
- Never follow a crop with the same family—shared diseases persist in soil.
- Include a cover crop or fallow period when possible to rebuild soil.
- 'Keep simple records: map your beds and note what was planted each season.'
- Adjust based on observation—if a crop struggles, that bed may need rest or amendment.

## Overview
Planning crop rotation by plant family to maintain soil fertility and reduce pest/disease pressure.

## Step-by-step
1. Group crops by family: legumes (beans, peas), nightshades (tomato, pepper), brassicas (cabbage, broccoli), cucurbits (squash), alliums (onion, garlic), grains.
2. Basic 4-year rotation: legumes → brassicas → nightshades/cucurbits → root crops/grains.
3. Legumes fix nitrogen—plant before heavy feeders (brassicas, corn).
4. Never follow a crop with the same family—shared diseases persist in soil.
5. Include a cover crop or fallow period when possible to rebuild soil.
6. Keep simple records: map your beds and note what was planted each season.
7. Adjust based on observation—if a crop struggles, that bed may need rest or amendment.
