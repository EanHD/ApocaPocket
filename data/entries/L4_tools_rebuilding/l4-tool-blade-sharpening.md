summary: Principles of edge geometry, sharpening angles, and honing techniques for
  knives and tools.
steps:
- 'Understand edge angles: 15° per side for fine cutting, 20–25° for general use,
  30°+ for chopping/splitting.'
- 'Find natural whetstones: fine-grained sandstone, slate, or river-smoothed stones.'
- 'Coarse sharpening: establish the bevel angle by grinding on coarse stone with water.'
- 'Fine honing: switch to smooth stone, maintain consistent angle, alternating sides.'
- Strop on smooth leather or cardboard to remove wire edge and polish.
- 'Test sharpness: blade should catch on thumbnail or shave arm hair.'
- Maintain edges regularly—frequent light honing prevents need for major resharpening.
warnings:
- Always cut away from your body when sharpening.
- Secure the stone—it should not slip during use.

## Overview
Principles of edge geometry, sharpening angles, and honing techniques for knives and tools.

## Step-by-step
1. Understand edge angles: 15° per side for fine cutting, 20–25° for general use, 30°+ for chopping/splitting.
2. Find natural whetstones: fine-grained sandstone, slate, or river-smoothed stones.
3. Coarse sharpening: establish the bevel angle by grinding on coarse stone with water.
4. Fine honing: switch to smooth stone, maintain consistent angle, alternating sides.
5. Strop on smooth leather or cardboard to remove wire edge and polish.
6. Test sharpness: blade should catch on thumbnail or shave arm hair.
7. Maintain edges regularly—frequent light honing prevents need for major resharpening.

## Warnings
- Always cut away from your body when sharpening.
- Secure the stone—it should not slip during use.
