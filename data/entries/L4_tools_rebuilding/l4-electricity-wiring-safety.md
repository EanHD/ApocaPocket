summary: Safe practices for basic electrical wiring, connections, and grounding in
  improvised systems.
steps:
- Always disconnect power before working on wiring.
- Use appropriate wire gauge for current load—thinner wire overheats with too much
  current.
- 'Rule of thumb: 14 AWG for ≤15A, 12 AWG for ≤20A in copper wire.'
- 'Make secure connections: twist wires together, solder if possible, insulate with
  tape or heat shrink.'
- 'Ground metal enclosures: connect to a metal rod driven into moist earth.'
- Install fuses or breakers—a simple fuse is a thin wire that melts before the main
  wire overheats.
- Keep wiring away from water, heat sources, and areas where it can be damaged.
warnings:
- Electrical shock can be fatal—never work on live circuits.
- Poor connections cause arcing and fire—ensure all joints are tight and insulated.
- Battery banks can deliver hundreds of amps in a short circuit—treat with same respect
  as mains power.

## Overview
Safe practices for basic electrical wiring, connections, and grounding in improvised systems.

## Step-by-step
1. Always disconnect power before working on wiring.
2. Use appropriate wire gauge for current load—thinner wire overheats with too much current.
3. Rule of thumb: 14 AWG for ≤15A, 12 AWG for ≤20A in copper wire.
4. Make secure connections: twist wires together, solder if possible, insulate with tape or heat shrink.
5. Ground metal enclosures: connect to a metal rod driven into moist earth.
6. Install fuses or breakers—a simple fuse is a thin wire that melts before the main wire overheats.
7. Keep wiring away from water, heat sources, and areas where it can be damaged.

## Warnings
- Electrical shock can be fatal—never work on live circuits.
- Poor connections cause arcing and fire—ensure all joints are tight and insulated.
- Battery banks can deliver hundreds of amps in a short circuit—treat with same respect as mains power.
