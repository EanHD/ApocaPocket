summary: Building simple season-extending structures from salvaged or natural materials.
steps:
- 'Cold frame: a bottomless box (wood, cinder block) with a transparent lid (glass,
  clear plastic) angled south.'
- 'Size: ~1m × 2m is manageable; lid must open for ventilation.'
- 'Hoop house: bend flexible rods (PVC, willow, metal) into arches, cover with clear
  plastic sheeting.'
- Anchor hoops firmly—wind is the primary threat to lightweight structures.
- 'Ventilation is critical: open ends/sides on warm days to prevent overheating and
  disease.'
- 'Thermal mass: fill dark containers with water inside the structure—absorbs heat
  by day, releases at night.'
- These structures extend growing season 4–8 weeks on each end and protect from frost.
warnings:
- Overheating kills plants faster than cold—always provide ventilation options.
- Plastic degrades in UV—replace or protect sheeting annually.

## Overview
Building simple season-extending structures from salvaged or natural materials.

## Step-by-step
1. Cold frame: a bottomless box (wood, cinder block) with a transparent lid (glass, clear plastic) angled south.
2. Size: ~1m × 2m is manageable; lid must open for ventilation.
3. Hoop house: bend flexible rods (PVC, willow, metal) into arches, cover with clear plastic sheeting.
4. Anchor hoops firmly—wind is the primary threat to lightweight structures.
5. Ventilation is critical: open ends/sides on warm days to prevent overheating and disease.
6. Thermal mass: fill dark containers with water inside the structure—absorbs heat by day, releases at night.
7. These structures extend growing season 4–8 weeks on each end and protect from frost.

## Warnings
- Overheating kills plants faster than cold—always provide ventilation options.
- Plastic degrades in UV—replace or protect sheeting annually.
