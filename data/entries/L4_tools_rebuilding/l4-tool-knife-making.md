summary: 'A knife is the most important survival tool. Two methods: forging (hammering hot steel to shape) and stock removal (grinding a blade from flat steel). Stock removal is easier for beginners. Good
  steel sources: old files, leaf springs, lawnmower blades, saw blades.'
warnings:
- Heat-treated steel is BRITTLE until tempered — a hardened but untempered blade will shatter like glass
- Grinding produces sparks and metal dust — eye protection essential, work upwind
- Quenching in water cracks some steels — oil is safer for unknown steels. If in doubt, use warm vegetable oil.
- NEVER quench with the edge pointing down — the thin edge cools faster than the spine and may crack. Quench edge-first into the liquid, moving gently.
steps:
- 'STEEL SELECTION: old flat files are the BEST easily-found knife steel (high carbon steel, W1 equivalent). Other sources: leaf springs (5160 steel — tough), lawnmower blades, circular saw blades, car
  coil springs. Test with a file: if a file skates and won''t bite, it''s hard steel (good for knives). Mild steel/rebar is too soft for a lasting edge.'
- 'STOCK REMOVAL METHOD (no forge needed): draw knife profile on flat steel with marker or scratched line. Cut rough shape with hacksaw or angle grinder. This is the blank. File or grind the bevel (cutting
  edge) to about 1mm thickness at the edge — do NOT make it razor thin yet (it''ll warp during heat treatment).'
- 'FORGING METHOD: heat steel to bright orange in forge. Hammer blade shape: draw out the tang (handle section) to about 1/3 of the blade width. Profile the blade by hammering on the anvil edge. Create
  the bevel by angling blows across the face. Keep cross-section even — thicker at spine, thin at edge.'
- 'BEFORE HEAT TREATMENT: file/grind blade to near-final shape. Bevel should be even on both sides. Handle tang should be shaped. Drill any handle pin holes NOW — you can''t drill hardened steel. Edge should
  be about 1mm thick (a dime thickness).'
- 'HARDENING: heat blade evenly to cherry red (use forge or a long fire). Test with magnet — steel becomes non-magnetic at the critical temperature (~770°C). This is the correct hardening temperature. Immediately
  quench in warm oil (35-50°C), plunging edge-first and moving gently in a figure-8 motion. Hold submerged for 10 seconds.'
- 'VERIFY HARDNESS: the blade should now scratch glass easily. A file should skate across the surface without biting. If the file bites, the blade didn''t harden — reheat and try again (you may have old
  mild steel that can''t harden).'
- 'TEMPERING: within 1 hour of hardening, temper to reduce brittleness. Place blade in an oven at 400°F (200°C) for 1 hour, or: polish the spine with sandstone and hold blade over low coals, watching the
  oxide colors creep from spine toward edge. When straw yellow reaches the edge, quench. This gives a hard edge with a tough spine.'
- 'HANDLE: for a tang handle, shape hardwood (oak, walnut, maple, birch) into two scales. Drill pin holes matching the tang. Epoxy or pin with brass/copper rod. For a simple handle: wrap tang tightly with
  cord or leather. Heat cord wrap and apply pine pitch or epoxy over the wrapping.'
- 'SHARPENING: start with coarse stone (100-200 grit or rough sandstone). Hold blade at 15-20° angle. Stroke edge-leading across stone 20-30 times per side. Move to medium stone (400-600 grit) for 20 strokes
  per side. Finish on fine stone (1000+ grit or smooth river stone) for a razor edge. Strop on smooth leather with compound if available.'
- 'SHEATH: fold thick leather around the blade, wet it, stitch along the spine side with heavy thread or sinew. Let dry on the blade (it will form to the shape). Add a belt loop. Or: make a friction-fit
  wooden sheath from two carved halves glued/lashed together.'

# Making a Knife — Forging and Stock Removal

A knife is the most important survival tool. Two methods: forging (hammering hot steel to shape) and stock removal (grinding a blade from flat steel). Stock removal is easier for beginners. Good steel sources: old files, leaf springs, lawnmower blades, saw blades.
