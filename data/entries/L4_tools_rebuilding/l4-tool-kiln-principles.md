summary: Designing and operating pit kilns and simple updraft kilns for pottery and
  lime production.
steps:
- 'Pit kiln: dig a pit, place dried pots on a bed of fuel, cover with more fuel and
  potsherds/earth.'
- Light from top or windward side; fire burns down through fuel over 4–8 hours.
- 'Updraft kiln: build a chamber with fire box below, ware chamber above, and chimney
  opening at top.'
- Construct from clay bricks, stone, or earth—walls must withstand 800–1000°C.
- Load kiln loosely for air circulation; heat slowly (hours) to avoid thermal shock.
- 'Peak temperature for earthenware: ~800–1000°C; for lime burning: 900°C+.'
- Cool slowly—opening too early causes cracking from thermal shock.
warnings:
- Kilns reach extreme temperatures—maintain safe distance during firing.
- Fire risk from sparks and radiant heat—clear area around kiln.
- Carbon monoxide produced during firing—only operate outdoors.

## Overview
Designing and operating pit kilns and simple updraft kilns for pottery and lime production.

## Step-by-step
1. Pit kiln: dig a pit, place dried pots on a bed of fuel, cover with more fuel and potsherds/earth.
2. Light from top or windward side; fire burns down through fuel over 4–8 hours.
3. Updraft kiln: build a chamber with fire box below, ware chamber above, and chimney opening at top.
4. Construct from clay bricks, stone, or earth—walls must withstand 800–1000°C.
5. Load kiln loosely for air circulation; heat slowly (hours) to avoid thermal shock.
6. Peak temperature for earthenware: ~800–1000°C; for lime burning: 900°C+.
7. Cool slowly—opening too early causes cracking from thermal shock.

## Warnings
- Kilns reach extreme temperatures—maintain safe distance during firing.
- Fire risk from sparks and radiant heat—clear area around kiln.
- Carbon monoxide produced during firing—only operate outdoors.
