summary: Lime (calcium oxide) and cement are binders for mortar and concrete. Lime made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) to 900C+. Mix lime with sand and water = mortar (binds bricks, stones). Portland
  cement is complex but lime mortar is achievable with primitive kiln.
warnings:
- Quicklime (calcium oxide) is caustic - causes severe burns on contact with water or skin
- Slaking lime (adding water to quicklime) produces extreme heat and steam - can explode if water added too fast
- Lime dust irritates lungs - work outdoors, avoid inhaling
steps:
- 'LIMESTONE: White/gray sedimentary rock (fizzes when acid applied). Common near ancient seabeds.'
- 'LIME KILN: Stone-lined pit or stack. Heat limestone to 900-1000C (red-hot glow) for 12+ hours. Limestone chemically changes (releases CO2, becomes quicklime).'
- 'SLAKING: Quicklime + water = slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). ADD WATER SLOWLY (sprinkle, do not pour). Mixture heats violently, steams, expands. Let cool and hydrate for days.'
- 'LIME MORTAR: Mix slaked lime + sand (3 parts sand to 1 part lime) + water. Result: paste. Spread between bricks or stones. Hardens by absorbing CO2 from air (carbonation). Sets slowly (weeks) but durable.'
- 'USES: Mortar for stone/brick walls, plaster for walls, whitewash (thin lime paint - disinfects and reflects light).'
- 'CEMENT (advanced): Lime + clay + high heat (1450C). Difficult to achieve primitive. Lime mortar is adequate for most construction.'

# Lime & Cement Making — Mortar for Construction

Lime (calcium oxide) and cement are binders for mortar and concrete. Lime made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) to 900C+. Mix lime with sand and water = mortar (binds bricks, stones). Portland cement is complex but lime mortar is achievable with primitive kiln.
