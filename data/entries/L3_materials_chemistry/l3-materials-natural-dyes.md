summary: 'Many plants produce natural dyes for coloring fabric, leather, cordage, and baskets. Common sources: onion skins (yellow/orange), walnut hulls (brown), indigo (blue), madder root (red), lichens
  (various). Process: extract dye by boiling plant material, mordant fabric (fixes dye), dye bath, rinse.'
warnings:
- Some dye plants are toxic - do not eat or inhale fumes
- Mordants (alum, iron, copper) can be toxic - handle carefully
- Natural dyes fade over time (light, washing)
- Dyeing is messy - wear old clothes, work outdoors
steps:
- 'COMMON DYE PLANTS: YELLOW/ORANGE: Onion skins (yellow-orange), goldenrod flowers (yellow), marigold (yellow), turmeric root (bright yellow). BROWN: Walnut hulls and bark (dark brown), oak bark (tan-brown),
  tea (light brown). RED/PINK: Madder root (red - requires cultivation), pokeweed berries (pink-red, toxic), beets (pink). BLUE: Indigo (requires fermentation vat - complex), woad (similar to indigo). PURPLE:
  Blackberries, elderberries (purple-gray). GREEN: Mix yellow + blue, or use algae, nettles (weak green). BLACK: Oak galls + iron (black ink, also dyes fabric).'
- 'MORDANTING (ESSENTIAL STEP): Mordant chemically binds dye to fabric. Without mordant, most natural dyes wash out immediately. ALUM (aluminum sulfate): Most common mordant. Available commercially or from
  some rocks/clays. Non-toxic. TANNIN: From oak bark, tea. Helps some dyes set. IRON (ferrous sulfate): Darkens colors. From rusty nails soaked in vinegar. Can damage fabric over time. COPPER: Brightens
  colors. From copper pipes or coins + vinegar. PROCESS: Dissolve 3-4 Tbsp mordant per gallon of water. Heat. Add fabric (must be clean). Simmer 1 hour. Remove, rinse.'
- 'DYE EXTRACTION: (1) Chop/crush plant material (leaves, flowers, berries, bark, roots). (2) Place in pot, cover with water (2-3x volume of plant material). (3) Simmer 1-2 hours. (4) Strain out plant matter.
  (5) Result: dye bath (colored liquid). For STRONG color, use more plant material or simmer longer.'
- 'DYEING FABRIC: (1) Wet pre-mordanted fabric. (2) Add to dye bath (fabric should be fully submerged). (3) Simmer 30-60 minutes. Stir occasionally. (4) Remove fabric (color will be lighter when dry). (5)
  Rinse in cool water until water runs clear. (6) Dry away from direct sun (sun fades color).'
- 'NATURAL FIBERS: Natural dyes work best on natural fibers (wool, cotton, linen, silk). Synthetic fibers (polyester, nylon) do not absorb natural dyes well. PROTEIN FIBERS (wool, silk): Take dye easily.
  CELLULOSE FIBERS (cotton, linen): Require tannin mordant first (oak bark soak), then alum.'
- 'COLOR FASTNESS: Natural dyes fade over time. To reduce fading: (1) Use mordant. (2) Dry in shade. (3) Wash in cool water (hot water removes dye). (4) Store away from light. Even with care, natural dyes
  fade more than synthetic dyes.'
- 'EXPERIMENTING: Different plants, mordants, and water chemistry produce different colors. EXPERIMENT: Try local plants. Keep notes (what plant, how much, which mordant, resulting color). Build a dye garden
  if settling long-term (cultivate best dye plants).'
