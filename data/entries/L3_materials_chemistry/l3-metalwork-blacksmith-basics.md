summary: Blacksmithing shapes iron and steel by heating and hammering. Essential for making durable tools (knives, axes, nails, hinges). Requires forge (high-temp fire), anvil (striking surface), hammer,
  tongs. Learning curve but invaluable long-term skill.
warnings:
- Forge temps (1000-1400C) cause severe burns - use long tongs and leather protection
- Sparks and scale (metal flakes) can injure eyes - wear safety glasses
- Hot metal looks identical to cool metal - never touch until confirmed cool
- Coal/charcoal forges produce carbon monoxide - work outdoors or with ventilation
steps:
- 'FORGE: Fireproof box with air source (bellows or hand-crank blower). Fuel: charcoal or coal. Heat metal to yellow-orange glow (forging temp).'
- 'ANVIL: Heavy steel block (or large flat rock as substitute). Hardened face for hammering.'
- 'FIRST PROJECT - HOOK: (1) Heat end of iron rod. (2) Hammer flat (draw out). (3) Bend into hook shape (over anvil edge). (4) Reheat as needed. Simple but useful.'
- 'SKILLS: Heating, hammer control, bending, cutting (chisel), punching holes, welding (joining two pieces). Start simple, practice.'
- 'TOOLS TO MAKE: Nails (cut and taper rod), knives (flatten, sharpen, harden), axes, hinges, chains.'
