summary: Different wood species have different properties (hardness, flexibility, rot resistance, workability). Selecting the right wood for each application improves durability and reduces labor. Field
  guide to common wood types and their best uses.
warnings:
- Green (freshly cut) wood shrinks as it dries - joints loosen, boards warp
- Some woods are toxic (black locust sawdust, yew) - avoid for food contact or inhalation
- Pressure-treated lumber contains toxic chemicals - do not burn, do not use for food contact
steps:
- 'HARDWOODS VS SOFTWOODS: HARDWOODS (oak, maple, ash, walnut): Denser, stronger, harder to work. Better for tools, furniture, structural members under stress. SOFTWOODS (pine, fir, cedar, spruce): Lighter,
  easier to work, less durable. Better for framing, carving, quick construction. RULE: Deciduous trees (lose leaves) are usually hardwood. Conifers (needles, cones) are usually softwood. EXCEPTION: Balsa
  is a hardwood but very soft.'
- 'BEST WOODS BY APPLICATION: TOOLS (axe handles, mallets, digging sticks): Ash (tough, shock-resistant), hickory (extremely strong), oak (hard, durable). BOWS: Osage orange (best), yew, ash, elm (flexible,
  does not break). ARROWS: Cedar, pine, birch (straight, lightweight). CONSTRUCTION LUMBER: Pine, fir, spruce (cheap, abundant, easy to work). Oak, chestnut for beams (strong). FIREWOOD: Oak, hickory, maple
  (dense, long-burning, high heat). Avoid pine (creosote buildup, low heat). CARVING: Basswood, pine, cedar (soft, easy to shape). WATERCRAFT: Cedar (rot-resistant, lightweight), oak (strong ribs/frames).
  UTENSILS/BOWLS: Maple, birch, cherry (food-safe, non-toxic, smooth finish). AVOID: Black walnut (toxic to some plants/animals), yew (toxic).'
- 'ROT RESISTANCE: HIGH: Cedar, black locust, white oak, cypress (outdoor use, ground contact, wet environments). MEDIUM: Most hardwoods (will rot eventually but last years). LOW: Pine, fir, spruce, birch
  (rot quickly when wet - treat or keep dry). USE: Rot-resistant woods for fence posts, foundations, outdoor structures.'
- 'WORKABILITY: EASY: Pine, cedar, basswood (soft, cut/carve easily). MEDIUM: Ash, birch, cherry. HARD: Oak, hickory, maple (dull tools quickly, require sharp edges). SPLITTING: Straight-grained woods split
  easily (oak, ash, pine). Twisted grain resists splitting (elm - good for chopping blocks, bad for firewood).'
- 'FLEXIBILITY: FLEXIBLE: Ash, willow, hickory (bows, tool handles, basketry). STIFF: Oak, maple (rigid structural members). BRITTLE: Dry cedar, old pine (snaps under stress).'
- 'SEASONING (DRYING): Freshly cut wood (green wood) is 30-50 percent water by weight. Drying improves strength, reduces weight, prevents warping. AIR DRY: Stack wood with spacers (air circulates). Cover
  top (rain protection). Takes 6-12 months per inch of thickness. KILN DRY: Faster (days to weeks) but requires equipment. FIELD USE: Use green wood immediately (stakes, rough construction) or split and
  dry for future use (tools, furniture).'
- 'IDENTIFYING WOOD: BARK: Unique to each species (oak has ridged bark, birch has papery bark). LEAVES/NEEDLES: Best identifier. GRAIN: Hardwoods have visible grain patterns. SMELL: Cedar smells aromatic,
  oak smells tannic. WEIGHT: Hardwoods are heavier than softwoods of same size.'
