summary: 'Clay is fine-grained soil that becomes plastic when wet and hard when fired. Used for pottery, bricks, plaster. Finding and testing clay: look near water, test for plasticity and shrinkage, fire
  a test piece. Not all clay is suitable for pottery (some crack or crumble when fired).'
warnings:
- Clay shrinks as it dries (10-30 percent) - large pieces crack if dried too fast
- Inadequate firing produces weak, porous pottery that breaks easily
- Some clay contains organic matter (makes it unusable for high-quality ceramics)
- Clay dust is harmful when inhaled - wet processing is safer
steps:
- 'WHERE TO FIND CLAY: RIVERBANKS: Eroded clay deposits exposed in cutbanks. LAKE/POND EDGES: Clay settles in still water. HILLSIDES: Road cuts, erosion gullies expose clay layers. BENEATH TOPSOIL: Dig
  1-3 feet (topsoil layer, then subsoil which may be clay). APPEARANCE: Clay is smooth, fine-textured, sticky when wet, hard when dry. Colors: red, brown, gray, white, yellow (depends on iron and mineral
  content).'
- 'FIELD TEST FOR CLAY: (1) SQUEEZE TEST: Wet a handful of soil. Squeeze into ball. If it holds shape and feels slippery/sticky, it has clay. If it crumbles, it is sand or silt. (2) RIBBON TEST: Roll wet
  sample into rope (pencil-thick). Try to drape it over your finger. Good clay forms ribbon without breaking. Poor clay crumbles. (3) SHINE TEST: Rub wet sample on fingernail or knife blade. Clay leaves
  shiny streak. Sand/silt does not.'
- 'PURITY: PURE CLAY: Smooth, no visible particles, very plastic. BEST for fine pottery. SANDY CLAY: Gritty feel. Sand grains visible. Less plastic. GOOD for large vessels, bricks (less shrinkage/cracking).
  ORGANIC CLAY: Contains plant matter, smells earthy. BAD for pottery (burns out during firing, leaves holes). Must be cleaned or avoided.'
- 'TEMPERING: Pure clay shrinks excessively and cracks. Add TEMPER (non-clay material) to reduce shrinkage. SAND: Most common temper. Adds strength, reduces cracking. GROG: Crushed fired pottery. SHELL:
  Crushed shells (traditional in some cultures). STRAW: For adobe bricks (not pottery - burns out). AMOUNT: 10-30 percent temper by volume.'
- 'TEST FIRING: Before making large pottery, test your clay: (1) Form small ball or tile. (2) Dry slowly (days to week) in shade. (3) Fire in campfire or kiln (see pottery entry). (4) EVALUATE: Does it
  hold shape? Is it hard? Does it crack? If successful, your clay is suitable. If it cracks badly or crumbles, add more temper or find better clay.'
- 'DRYING SHRINKAGE: Clay shrinks 5-15 percent as it dries. Measure test piece before and after drying. High shrinkage = more cracking risk. Add temper to reduce shrinkage.'
- 'FIRING TEMPERATURE: Low-fire clays mature at 1000-1100C (campfire achievable). High-fire clays need 1200-1400C (requires kiln). Most natural clays are low-fire. Underfired pottery is weak and porous.
  Overfired pottery melts or bloats.'

# Clay Identification & Testing for Pottery

Clay is fine-grained soil that becomes plastic when wet and hard when fired. Used for pottery, bricks, plaster. Finding and testing clay: look near water, test for plasticity and shrinkage, fire a test piece. Not all clay is suitable for pottery (some crack or crumble when fired).
