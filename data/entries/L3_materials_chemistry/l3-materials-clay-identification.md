summary: 'Clay is fine-grained soil (particles <0.002mm) that becomes plastic when wet and hard when fired. Chemical composition: hydrated aluminum silicates (Al2Si2O5(OH)4 for kaolinite). Used for pottery,
  bricks, plaster. Finding and testing clay: look near water, test for plasticity and shrinkage, fire a test piece at 900-1200°C. Not all clay is suitable for pottery (some crack or crumble when fired).'
warnings:
- Clay shrinks as it dries (10-30 percent) - large pieces crack if dried too fast. SAFE DRYING RATE: 5-10mm thickness per day in 15-25°C ambient temperature, 50-70% humidity
- Inadequate firing produces weak, porous pottery. MINIMUM TEMPERATURE: 900°C for earthenware. Hold peak temperature for 30-60 minutes
- Some clay contains organic matter (makes it unusable for high-quality ceramics) - burn-out temperature is 200-600°C, leaves voids
- Clay dust is harmful when inhaled (silicosis risk after prolonged exposure to particles <10 microns). ALWAYS use wet processing methods. If dry grinding necessary, wear N95 or P100 respirator
- Lead contamination possible in urban/industrial clay deposits - test before food use
steps:
- 'WHERE TO FIND CLAY: RIVERBANKS: Eroded clay deposits exposed in cutbanks (look for blue-gray or red layers 0.5-3m below surface). LAKE/POND EDGES: Clay settles in still water (finest particles settle
  farthest from shore). HILLSIDES: Road cuts, erosion gullies expose clay layers. BENEATH TOPSOIL: Dig 0.3-1m (topsoil layer), then 0.5-2m (subsoil which may be clay). APPEARANCE: Clay is smooth, fine-textured
  (particles <0.002mm), sticky when wet, hard when dry. Colors: red (iron oxide Fe2O3, 3-8%), brown (mixed oxides), gray (organic matter or lack of oxygen), white (pure kaolin, low iron <1%), yellow (hydrated
  iron oxides).'
- 'FIELD TEST FOR CLAY: (1) SQUEEZE TEST: Wet a 50g handful of soil to consistency of modeling dough. Squeeze into ball. If it holds shape and feels slippery/sticky (plasticity index >7), it has clay.
  If it crumbles, it is sand (particle size 0.05-2mm) or silt (0.002-0.05mm). (2) RIBBON TEST: Roll wet sample into rope 6-10mm thick. Try to drape it over your finger forming ribbon. EXCELLENT CLAY: ribbon
  extends 50-75mm without breaking. GOOD CLAY: 25-50mm. POOR CLAY: <25mm or crumbles. (3) SHINE TEST: Rub wet sample on fingernail or knife blade. Clay leaves shiny streak (mica-like luster). Sand/silt
  does not. (4) SETTLING TEST: Mix 100ml soil with 500ml water in clear jar. Shake vigorously. Let settle 24-48 hours. LAYERS form: bottom=sand (settles in 1 minute), middle=silt (settles in 1-2 hours),
  top=clay (settles in 24+ hours). Measure layer thicknesses to estimate clay percentage.'
- 'PURITY & COMPOSITION: PURE CLAY: Smooth, no visible particles, very plastic (can make 75mm ribbon). BEST for fine pottery. Chemical formula: Al2Si2O5(OH)4 (kaolinite), Al2O3·2SiO2·2H2O. Melting point:
  1750-1800°C. SANDY CLAY: Gritty feel. Sand grains visible. Less plastic (25-40mm ribbon). GOOD for large vessels, bricks (less shrinkage/cracking). 15-35% sand content. ORGANIC CLAY: Contains plant matter
  (>5% carbon), smells earthy when wet. BAD for pottery (burns out during firing at 200-600°C, leaves holes). Must be cleaned or avoided. IRON-RICH CLAY: Red when fired (3-8% Fe2O3). Fires at lower temperature
  (900-1100°C). KAOLIN (white clay): Low iron (<1%). Fires white. Higher temperature needed (1200-1400°C).'
- 'TEMPERING (REDUCING SHRINKAGE): Pure clay shrinks excessively (15-30%) and cracks. Add TEMPER (non-clay material) to reduce shrinkage to 5-10%. SAND: Most common temper. Particle size 0.25-1mm. Adds
  strength, reduces cracking. GROG: Crushed fired pottery. Same thermal expansion as clay (prevents stress cracks). Particle size 0.5-2mm. SHELL: Crushed shells (traditional in some cultures). Adds calcium,
  which can cause spalling if not fully crushed to <1mm. STRAW: For adobe bricks (not pottery - burns out at 200-400°C). LENGTH: 25-75mm pieces. AMOUNT: 10-30% temper by volume (20% is typical starting
  point). MIXING: Add temper to dry clay powder, then add water gradually while kneading. Knead 10-15 minutes until uniform consistency.'
- 'SHRINKAGE TEST: Before making large pottery, measure shrinkage: (1) Form wet clay tile 100mm × 100mm × 10mm. Mark with precise lines 90mm apart. (2) Dry slowly (7-14 days) in shade at 15-25°C, 50-70%
  humidity. Turn daily to prevent warping. (3) Measure distance between marks when bone dry. CALCULATION: Shrinkage % = (100 × (original - dried) / original). EVALUATION: 5-8% = excellent (low crack risk).
  8-12% = good (acceptable). 12-18% = high (add more temper). >18% = excessive (unsuitable without significant tempering).'
- 'FIRING TEMPERATURE TEST: (1) Form small tiles 50mm × 50mm × 8mm from tempered clay (make 5-10 samples). Inscribe each with different temperature mark. (2) Dry completely (bone dry, 7-14 days). (3) Fire
  in campfire or kiln at increasing temperatures: 600°C (dull red), 800°C (bright red), 900°C (orange), 1000°C (yellow-orange), 1100°C (yellow), 1200°C (bright yellow). (4) Hold peak temperature 30-60
  minutes. (5) Cool slowly (12-24 hours) to prevent thermal shock cracking. (6) EVALUATE each sample: UNDERFIRED (<800°C): Crumbles when scratched, absorbs water readily (>15% weight gain). PROPERLY FIRED
  (900-1100°C): Hard, rings when tapped, minimal water absorption (<5% weight gain after 24h soak). OVERFIRED (>1200°C): Bloated, distorted, or melted. VITRIFICATION: Water absorption <2% indicates full
  vitrification (non-porous). (7) RING TEST: Suspend fired tile by string, tap with metal rod. Clear ringing tone = well-fired and crack-free. Dull thud = cracks or underfired.'
- 'PLASTICITY MEASUREMENT: Mix clay with water to modeling consistency (40-50% water by weight for most clays). Roll into ball 25mm diameter. Press flat between two boards to 5mm thickness. RESULT: No cracks
  at edge = EXCELLENT plasticity. Fine cracks <1mm = GOOD plasticity. Large cracks >2mm = POOR plasticity (add more clay or bentonite 2-5% by weight to increase plasticity). BENTONITE ADDITION: Highly
  plastic clay (montmorillonite Al2O3·4SiO2·H2O). Add 2-5% to improve plasticity of short clays.'
- 'PH TESTING: Most pottery clays are pH 5-8. ACIDIC CLAY (pH <5.5): May contain organic acids, test fire before use. ALKALINE CLAY (pH >8.5): May contain soluble salts (causes white scum on fired surface).
  Leach with water before use. TEST METHOD: Mix 10g clay with 50ml distilled water, let settle 1 hour, test supernatant with pH paper or meter.'
