summary: 'Stone tools were humanitys first tools. Flint knapping (chipping stone to make sharp edges) produces knives, scrapers, arrowheads, hand axes. Requires practice and understanding of stone fracture.
  Best stones: flint, obsidian, chert, quartzite.'
warnings:
- Stone flakes are razor-sharp - wear eye protection and gloves
- Flying chips can cut skin or eyes
- Knapping produces loud noise (ear protection recommended for extended sessions)
- Learning curve is steep - expect many failures before success
steps:
- 'STONE SELECTION: BEST: Flint, chert, obsidian (glass-like fracture, very sharp edges). GOOD: Quartzite, jasper. POOR: Granite, sandstone (too coarse). IDENTIFY: Look for fine-grained stone with conchoidal
  fracture (breaks in smooth curves like glass). Test: Strike two stones together - flint produces sparks and sharp sound.'
- 'TOOLS NEEDED: HAMMERSTONE: Hard round stone (baseball-sized) for striking. PRESSURE FLAKER: Antler tip, bone, or hard wood for fine shaping. LEATHER PAD: Protects hand holding stone. SAFETY GEAR: Leather
  gloves, eye protection.'
- 'BASIC TECHNIQUE (HARD HAMMER PERCUSSION): (1) Hold core stone (large piece you are shaping) in one hand on leather pad. (2) Strike edge of core at 45-degree angle with hammerstone (not flat-on). (3)
  Flake breaks off. (4) Repeat around edge, rotating core. (5) Result: Core becomes smaller, sharp flakes accumulate. FLAKES are your tools (sharp edges, can be used as-is for cutting/scraping).'
- 'PRESSURE FLAKING (FINE SHAPING): For arrowheads, refined tools: (1) Start with large flake (triangular piece from core). (2) Hold flake with edge up. (3) Press antler tip against edge (firm pressure,
  push downward). (4) Tiny flake breaks off. (5) Work around edge, creating serrations or smooth edge. (6) Result: Shaped point or blade. REQUIRES PRACTICE.'
- 'COMMON STONE TOOLS: HAND AXE: Large core with one sharp edge (chopping, digging). KNIFE: Sharp flake (cutting, skinning). SCRAPER: Thick flake with steep edge (scraping hides, wood). ARROWHEAD/SPEARPOINT:
  Pressure-flaked thin point (hunting). DRILL: Pointed tool (making holes in leather, wood, shell).'
- 'HAFTING (ATTACHING HANDLE): (1) Notch stone tool (for binding) or leave tang (narrow base). (2) Split end of wood handle. (3) Insert tool. (4) Bind with cordage and/or glue (pine pitch, hide glue). (5)
  Wrap tightly. Result: Axe, knife, spear with stone head and wood handle.'
- 'SHARPENING: Stone tools dull quickly. RESHARPEN: Strike edge with small hammerstone (removes tiny flakes, creates new sharp edge) or use pressure flaker. Stone tools can be resharpened many times until
  too small to use.'
- 'LEARNING: Expect to waste many stones while learning. Practice on abundant stones (river cobbles). Study archaeological examples (museums, books). Flint knapping is an art - some people are naturals,
  others struggle. Patience and practice are key.'
