summary: 'Rope is essential for shelter, traps, tools, climbing, hauling. Natural cordage can be made from plant fibers, bark, roots, sinew, rawhide. Quick field methods for emergency cordage. Techniques:
  simple twist, reverse-wrap, braiding.'
warnings:
- Natural cordage is weaker than modern rope - test before critical use
- Wet cordage is weaker (50 percent strength loss when wet)
- Knots reduce rope strength by 30-50 percent - factor this into safety margins
- Natural rope degrades (rots) - replace regularly
steps:
- 'QUICK FIELD CORDAGE (EMERGENCY): MATERIALS: Long grasses, bark strips, green plant stems (dogbane, milkweed, nettle), roots (spruce, willow), rawhide strips, sinew. METHOD: (1) Gather strands (at least
  3 feet long). (2) Hold strands together at one end. (3) Twist strands clockwise (Z-twist) by rolling between palms or against thigh. (4) When half-twisted, fold in half. (5) Strands will twist together
  counter-clockwise (S-twist). (6) Result: 2-ply cord. STRENGTH: Weak but usable for light tasks (lashing, tying bundles).'
- 'REVERSE-WRAP METHOD (STRONGER): (1) Start with 2 strands. (2) Twist each strand clockwise (tightly). (3) Wrap twisted strands around each other counter-clockwise. (4) ADD LENGTH: As you reach end of
  strand, overlap new strand (6+ inches) and continue twisting. Overlaps are staggered (not at same point). (5) Result: Continuous rope of any length. STRENGTH: Moderate. Good for general use.'
- 'BRAIDING (FLAT ROPE): (1) Use 3 or more strands. (2) Braid like hair (over-under pattern). (3) Result: Flat rope. STRENGTH: Similar to twisted but wider/flatter (better for some applications like handles,
  straps).'
- 'MATERIALS BY STRENGTH: STRONGEST: Sinew (animal tendon - dried and twisted), rawhide strips, dogbane fibers, hemp. MODERATE: Bark (basswood inner bark, cedar), nettle, yucca, willow roots. WEAK: Grass
  (use many strands), green plant stems (temporary only). AVOID: Dry brittle materials (break easily).'
- 'TESTING STRENGTH: Pull test. Estimate breaking strength: (1) Finger-thick cordage: 20-50 lbs. (2) Thumb-thick: 50-100 lbs. (3) Wrist-thick: 100-300 lbs. These are rough estimates - actual strength varies
  by material and construction. SAFETY MARGIN: Use rope rated 3-5x the expected load.'
- 'KNOTS: Learn basic knots: SQUARE KNOT (joining two ropes), BOWLINE (non-slip loop), CLOVE HITCH (securing to pole), TAUT-LINE HITCH (adjustable loop for tent guylines). Practice with modern rope, then
  apply to natural cordage.'
- 'PRESERVATION: Natural cordage rots when wet. DRY THOROUGHLY after use. Store in dry place. Treat with fat/oil (waterproofs and preserves). Replace when frayed, weak, or rotted.'

# Rope Making — Field Cordage from Natural Materials

Rope is essential for shelter, traps, tools, climbing, hauling. Natural cordage can be made from plant fibers, bark, roots, sinew, rawhide. Quick field methods for emergency cordage. Techniques: simple twist, reverse-wrap, braiding.
