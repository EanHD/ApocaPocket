summary: 'Many plants produce strong fibers suitable for cordage (rope, string), textiles (cloth, baskets), and other uses. Best fibers: flax, hemp, nettle, yucca, cattail, milkweed, dogbane, inner bark
  of trees. Processing: harvest, ret (rot away non-fiber material), dry, twist into cordage.'
warnings:
- Retting (rotting) fibers produces foul smell - do this away from living areas
- Some plant fibers cause skin irritation (nettle) - wear gloves during processing
- Weak fibers break under load - test cordage before relying on it for critical use
- Processing fibers is extremely labor-intensive
steps:
- 'BEST FIBER PLANTS: FLAX: Fine, strong fibers from stem. Traditional linen source. Requires cultivation. HEMP: Very strong. Illegal in some areas but grows wild. NETTLE: Strong fibers in stem (despite
  sting). Common weed. MILKWEED: Silky fibers in stem and seed pods. DOGBANE: Very strong, traditional Native American fiber. YUCCA: Leaves yield tough fibers (see yucca entry). CATTAIL: Leaves for weaving
  (baskets, mats). INNER BARK: Basswood, cedar, willow (strip inner bark, twist into cordage). SINEW: Animal tendon (not plant but excellent cordage).'
- 'HARVESTING: (1) Cut plant stems when mature (after flowering, before winter). (2) Remove leaves. (3) Bundle stems, hang to dry or process immediately. TIMING: Late summer/fall for most fiber plants.'
- 'RETTING (ROTTING AWAY NON-FIBER): Goal: Decompose pectin that binds fibers to rest of plant. WATER RETTING: Submerge bundles in pond, stream, or tank for 1-2 weeks. Water turns dark, smells terrible.
  Check daily - fibers separate easily when ready. Rinse thoroughly. DEW RETTING: Lay stems on grass, turn daily. Takes 2-4 weeks. Less smelly. FIELD RETTING: Leave stems in field (frost and rain ret naturally).
  Slowest. NO RETTING: Some plants (yucca, inner bark) do not require retting - fibers can be stripped directly.'
- 'SEPARATING FIBERS: After retting, break woody stem core (beat with stick, run through brake tool, or hand-crush). Comb/scrape away debris. Result: bundle of long fibers. Dry thoroughly.'
- 'SPINNING (TWISTING INTO THREAD): (1) Take small bundle of fibers (pinkie-thick). (2) Twist between palms or against thigh. (3) When half-twisted, fold in half and let it twist on itself (creates 2-ply
  cord). (4) Add more fibers by overlapping ends and continuing to twist. (5) Result: strong cordage. DIRECTION: Twist fibers clockwise (Z-twist), then twist strands together counter-clockwise (S-twist).
  This locks the cord.'
- 'STRENGTH TESTING: Pull test. Cordage should hold 10-20 lbs before breaking (adequate for most uses). Thicker cordage = stronger. Test before using for critical applications (climbing, securing shelters).'
- 'USES: (1) ROPE: Thick twisted cordage. (2) FISHING LINE: Fine twisted fibers. (3) SEWING THREAD: Very fine fibers. (4) BASKETRY: Flat leaves (cattail, yucca) or split cordage. (5) NETS: Knot cordage
  into mesh (fishing nets, carrying nets). (6) CLOTH: Weaving (requires loom - advanced). Flax and hemp make linen fabric.'

# Natural Fibers — Plant Fibers for Cordage & Textiles

Many plants produce strong fibers suitable for cordage (rope, string), textiles (cloth, baskets), and other uses. Best fibers: flax, hemp, nettle, yucca, cattail, milkweed, dogbane, inner bark of trees. Processing: harvest, ret (rot away non-fiber material), dry, twist into cordage.
