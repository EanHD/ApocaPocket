# Heart Attack Recognition & Response

## Overview

Heart attacks kill 600,000 Americans yearly - #1 cause of death. **Time is muscle:** Every minute of delayed treatment = more heart tissue death.

**CRITICAL:** Early recognition + aspirin + evacuation = survival. Delayed treatment = permanent heart damage or death.

---

## Classic vs Atypical Symptoms

### Classic Symptoms (60% of cases)

**"Elephant sitting on chest":**
- **Chest pressure/squeezing** (not sharp pain, more like heavy weight)
- Lasts >5 minutes (angina <5 minutes, heart attack >5 minutes)
- Does NOT go away with rest
- May come and go in waves

**Radiation:**
- Left arm pain (most common, 50% of cases)
- Jaw pain (often mistaken for toothache)
- Neck/throat pain
- Back pain between shoulder blades
- Right arm pain (less common but still significant)

**Associated symptoms:**
- Cold sweat (profuse, sudden)
- Nausea, vomiting (30% of cases)
- Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
- Lightheadedness, dizziness
- Sense of impending doom (anxiety, feeling like you're dying)

### Women's Symptoms (Often Different!)

**Women are MORE likely to have atypical symptoms:**

| Symptom | Women | Men |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Chest pain** | 60% | 80% |
| **Extreme fatigue** | 70% | 40% |
| **Nausea/vomiting** | 40% | 20% |
| **Shortness of breath** | 58% | 40% |
| **Back pain** | 40% | 20% |
| **Jaw pain** | 30% | 15% |

**Women's "silent" heart attacks:**
- May present as only fatigue, nausea, or back pain
- NO chest pain in 40% of women's heart attacks
- Often mistaken for flu, indigestion, anxiety

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** If woman over 50 with cardiovascular risk factors has unexplained fatigue + nausea + shortness of breath, assume heart attack until proven otherwise.

## Differentiating from Other Conditions

### Heart Attack vs Angina

| Feature | Angina | Heart Attack |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Duration** | <5 minutes | >5 minutes (often 20-30+ min) |
| **Relief with rest** | YES | NO |
| **Relief with nitroglycerin** | YES (within 5 min) | Partial or none |
| **Severity** | Predictable, stable | Severe, worsening |
| **Sweating** | Mild or none | Profuse cold sweat |

**Angina = warning sign** (insufficient blood flow during exertion, resolves with rest)  
**Heart attack = blocked artery** (tissue death occurring now)

### Heart Attack vs Anxiety/Panic Attack

| Feature | Anxiety | Heart Attack |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Chest pain type** | Sharp, stabbing, localized | Pressure, squeezing, diffuse |
| **Breathing** | Rapid, hyperventilating | Normal or difficulty breathing |
| **Sweating** | Minimal or stress-related | Profuse cold sweat |
| **Nausea** | Rare | Common (30%) |
| **Duration** | Peaks in 10 min, resolves in 20-30 min | Worsens over time |
| **Age** | Usually <40 | Usually >40 (but can occur younger) |
| **Radiation** | Rare | Common (arm, jaw, back) |

**Key differentiator:** Anxiety improves with calming techniques, heart attacks do NOT.

### Heart Attack vs GERD (Heartburn)

| Feature | GERD | Heart Attack |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Location** | Behind breastbone, upper abdomen | Chest center, may radiate |
| **Trigger** | After eating, lying down | Often at rest or with exertion |
| **Relief with antacids** | YES (within 5-15 min) | NO |
| **Burning sensation** | YES | Rare (more pressure/squeezing) |
| **Sour taste** | Common | Absent |

⚠️ **DANGER:** Many people die from heart attacks because they assumed it was "just heartburn." **If in doubt, treat as heart attack.**

## HEART Score (Risk Stratification)

**Estimate risk of Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) in next 6 weeks:**

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| **History:** Low risk = 0, Moderate = 1, High = 2 | 0-2 |
| **EKG:** Normal = 0, Non-specific changes = 1, Significant = 2 | 0-2 |
| **Age:** <45 = 0, 45-64 = 1, ≥65 = 2 | 0-2 |
| **Risk factors:** None = 0, 1-2 factors = 1, ≥3 factors = 2 | 0-2 |
| **Troponin:** Normal = 0, 1-3x normal = 1, >3x normal = 2 | 0-2 |

**Risk factors:** Hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, family history, obesity

**Score interpretation:**
- **0-3 points:** Low risk (2% MACE) - may be safe to observe
- **4-6 points:** Moderate risk (12% MACE) - needs further evaluation
- **7-10 points:** High risk (65% MACE) - **EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY**

**Field use (without EKG/troponin):** Focus on history, age, risk factors
- **Age 65+ with 3+ risk factors:** High risk, assume heart attack
- **Age 45-64 with chest pain + arm/jaw pain:** Moderate-high risk, treat as heart attack

## Emergency Treatment (First 30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Aspirin (IMMEDIATELY)

**Dosing:**
- **325mg chewed immediately** (regular strength, not enteric-coated)
- **Time matters:** Aspirin given within first 30 min reduces death by 23%

**How to give:**
1. **Chew thoroughly** (faster absorption than swallowing whole)
2. Can be chewed dry or with small amount of water
3. Effect starts in 5-10 minutes

**Contraindications (DO NOT give aspirin if):**
- Known aspirin allergy
- Active bleeding (GI bleed, recent trauma)
- Recent stroke (<3 months) - **may be hemorrhagic**
- Severe bleeding disorder (hemophilia)

**If no aspirin available:**
- Other NSAIDs (ibuprofen 400-600mg) have some effect but NOT as good
- Do NOT delay evacuation to find aspirin

### Step 2: Nitroglycerin (If Available)

**Dosing:**
- **0.4mg (1 tablet or spray) under tongue**
- **Repeat every 5 minutes** (max 3 doses in 15 minutes)
- **Purpose:** Dilates coronary arteries, improves blood flow

**Contraindications (DO NOT give nitroglycerin if):**
- Systolic BP <90 mmHg (causes dangerous drop in BP)
- Heart rate <50 or >100 bpm
- Right ventricular infarct (inferior MI) - can cause fatal hypotension
- Recent Viagra/Cialis use (<24-48 hours) - **FATAL interaction**

**Expected effects:**
- Headache (common, from vasodilation)
- Drop in BP (10-20 mmHg normal)
- Flushing, lightheadedness

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** If nitroglycerin causes severe drop in BP (fainting, confusion, pale skin), **DO NOT give more doses.** Lay person flat, elevate legs.

### Step 3: Positioning

**Semi-reclined (45-degree angle):**
- Sitting upright or semi-reclined reduces heart workload
- **DO NOT lie flat** (increases heart workload, may worsen symptoms)
- Support back with pillows, backpack, etc.

**If person loses consciousness:**
- Lay flat, check pulse
- If no pulse → start CPR immediately
- If pulse present → recovery position, monitor closely

### Step 4: Oxygen (If Available)

**Supplemental oxygen:**
- 4 liters/minute via nasal cannula
- OR 8-15 liters/minute via non-rebreather mask
- **Target:** Oxygen saturation >90%

**Sources (in survival scenarios):**
- Portable oxygen concentrator
- Oxygen tanks (automotive, welding - 100% O₂ safe to breathe)
- Hyperbaric chamber (if available)

### Step 5: Calm and Reassure

**Psychological support:**
- Keep person calm (stress increases heart workload)
- Speak calmly, reassure help is coming
- Encourage slow, deep breaths
- DO NOT leave person alone

## CPR Readiness

**Heart attack can progress to cardiac arrest:**

| Time | Event | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 0-15 min | Chest pain, stable | Aspirin, nitroglycerin, monitor |
| 15-30 min | Severe pain, worsening | Prepare for evacuation, ready CPR |
| 30-60 min | Altered consciousness, irregular pulse | **HIGH RISK of arrest**, stay ready |
| 60+ min | Loss of consciousness, no pulse | **Start CPR immediately** |

**Signs heart attack is progressing to arrest:**
- Confusion, drowsiness (hypoxia)
- Irregular pulse (arrhythmia)
- Rapid breathing or gasping
- Loss of consciousness

**CPR for cardiac arrest:**
1. **Call for help**
2. **Check pulse** (carotid artery, 10 seconds)
3. **If no pulse:** 30 compressions : 2 breaths
4. **Compression depth:** 2 inches (5 cm)
5. **Rate:** 100-120 compressions/minute ("Stayin' Alive" tempo)
6. **Continue until:** Person recovers, AED arrives, or exhausted

## Time-Critical Nature

**"Time is Muscle":**

| Time to Treatment | Mortality | Heart Damage |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **<1 hour** | 5% | Minimal (10-20% of muscle) |
| **1-3 hours** | 8% | Moderate (20-40% of muscle) |
| **3-6 hours** | 12% | Significant (40-60% of muscle) |
| **6-12 hours** | 20% | Severe (60-80% of muscle) |
| **>12 hours** | 30% | Massive (80-100% of muscle) |

**Every minute counts:**
- **30 min:** "Golden hour" for best outcomes
- **90 min:** Ideal window for clot-busting drugs (tPA) or catheterization
- **6 hours:** Maximum benefit from reperfusion therapy
- **12 hours:** Limited benefit, but still worth treating

---

## Evacuation Priorities

**EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY if:**
- Chest pain/pressure >5 minutes not relieved by rest
- Chest pain + radiation (arm, jaw, back)
- Women with atypical symptoms (fatigue + nausea + SOB) and risk factors
- Known cardiovascular disease with new/worsening symptoms
- Any suspected heart attack (better safe than sorry)

**DO NOT:**
- Drive yourself (25% of heart attack deaths occur while driving)
- Wait to "see if it gets better" (every minute = more damage)
- Assume "I'm too young" (heart attacks occur at all ages, even 20s-30s)

**Transport considerations:**
- Call 911/EMS first (they can start treatment en route)
- If no EMS available: passenger seat (easier CPR access than back seat)
- Continue aspirin, monitor closely
- Be ready to start CPR

---

## Risk Factors (Know Your Risk)

**Major risk factors:**
- Age (men >45, women >55)
- Smoking (doubles risk)
- High blood pressure (>140/90)
- High cholesterol (LDL >130)
- Diabetes
- Family history (parent/sibling with heart disease <55/65)
- Obesity (BMI >30)
- Sedentary lifestyle

**Risk multiplies:**
- 1 factor: 2x risk
- 2 factors: 4x risk
- 3+ factors: 10x risk

**Know your numbers:**
- Blood pressure: <120/80 (normal), 140/90+ (high)
- Cholesterol: Total <200, LDL <100
- Blood sugar: Fasting <100 (normal), >126 (diabetes)

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Waiting to "see if it improves":** Heart attacks worsen over time, early treatment critical
2. ❌ **Assuming "I'm too young":** 10% of heart attacks occur in people <45
3. ❌ **Mistaking for heartburn/indigestion:** Many deaths from this mistake
4. ❌ **Women ignoring atypical symptoms:** 40% of women have NO chest pain
5. ❌ **Driving yourself to hospital:** High risk of crash or cardiac arrest
6. ❌ **Taking nitroglycerin with low BP:** Can cause fatal hypotension
7. ❌ **Not chewing aspirin:** Swallowing whole delays effect by 20+ minutes

---

## Prevention (Long-Term)

**Lifestyle modifications:**
- Stop smoking (reduces risk by 50% within 1 year)
- Exercise 30 min/day, 5 days/week
- Mediterranean diet (fish, olive oil, nuts, vegetables)
- Maintain healthy weight (BMI 18.5-24.9)
- Control blood pressure (<120/80)
- Control cholesterol (statin if needed)
- Manage diabetes (A1C <7%)

**Medications (if prescribed):**
- Aspirin 81mg daily (if high risk)
- Statin (cholesterol-lowering)
- ACE inhibitor or ARB (blood pressure)
- Beta-blocker (after heart attack, reduces second MI risk)

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **Classic symptoms:** Chest pressure/squeezing + left arm/jaw pain + cold sweat
2. ✅ **Women's symptoms are different:** Fatigue + nausea + SOB (often NO chest pain)
3. ✅ **Aspirin 325mg chewed immediately:** Reduces death by 23%, time matters
4. ✅ **Nitroglycerin 0.4mg under tongue:** Repeat every 5 min (max 3 doses), but NOT if BP <90 or recent Viagra
5. ✅ **Time is muscle:** Every minute of delay = more heart damage, evacuate immediately
6. ✅ **DO NOT drive yourself:** 25% of deaths occur while driving, call EMS or have someone drive you

**Heart attacks are the #1 killer, but early recognition + aspirin + evacuation = survival. Know the signs, act fast, and you can save a life.**
