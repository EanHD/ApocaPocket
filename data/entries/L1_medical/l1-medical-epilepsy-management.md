# Epilepsy & Seizure Management

## Overview

3.4 million Americans have epilepsy. Seizures can be life-threatening if prolonged (>5 min) or cause injury.

**CRITICAL:** Status epilepticus (seizure >5 min) = medical emergency, can cause permanent brain damage or death.

---

## Seizure First Aid (Most Important!)

**During seizure:**
1. **Protect from injury:**
   - Move away from furniture, stairs, water
   - Put something soft under head (jacket, pillow)
   - DO NOT restrain movements (can cause injury)
   
2. **Turn on side** (recovery position):
   - Prevents aspiration of saliva/vomit
   - Keeps airway open
   
3. **Time the seizure:**
   - Start timing when convulsions begin
   - If >5 minutes = status epilepticus (call 911)
   
4. **DO NOT:**
   - Put objects in mouth (can break teeth, cause choking)
   - Hold down or restrain (can cause fractures, dislocations)
   - Give food/water (aspiration risk)
   
5. **After seizure ends:**
   - Keep on side (recovery position)
   - Check breathing (may be slow/shallow initially)
   - Stay with person until fully alert (10-30 min)
   - Reassure (confusion normal after seizure)

---

## Types of Seizures

**Generalized tonic-clonic (Grand Mal):**
- Sudden loss of consciousness
- Stiffening (tonic phase, 10-30 sec)
- Jerking (clonic phase, 30-60 sec)
- Postictal confusion (10-30 min after)
- May bite tongue, lose bladder control

**Absence (Petit Mal):**
- Brief staring spell (5-10 sec)
- No awareness during episode
- Returns to normal activity immediately
- Often mistaken for "daydreaming"

**Focal seizures:**
- Awareness may be preserved or impaired
- Jerking of one limb, face twitching
- Aura (warning signs: smell, vision, sensation)
- May progress to generalized tonic-clonic

**Atonic (Drop Attack):**
- Sudden loss of muscle tone
- Person collapses/falls
- High injury risk (head trauma)

---

## Status Epilepticus (Emergency!)

**Definition:** Seizure lasting >5 minutes OR multiple seizures without regaining consciousness

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Brain hypoxia (low oxygen)
- Metabolic stress (high temp, acidosis)
- Permanent brain damage after 30-60 min
- Mortality 20-30% without treatment

**Emergency management:**
1. **Call for help immediately** (>5 min = emergency)
2. **Protect airway:** Recovery position, clear vomit
3. **Rescue medications** (if available):
   - Diazepam rectal gel: 0.2-0.5mg/kg (10-20mg adult)
   - Midazolam IM/intranasal: 5-10mg adult
   - Lorazepam IM: 4mg adult
4. **Oxygen** if available (hypoxia common)
5. **EVACUATE URGENTLY** (even if seizure stops, risk of recurrence)

## Medication Management

**Common anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs):**

| Medication | Typical Dose | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Phenytoin (Dilantin)** | 300-400mg/day | Requires consistent blood levels |
| **Carbamazepine (Tegretol)** | 400-1200mg/day | Take with food |
| **Valproic acid (Depakote)** | 500-2000mg/day | Monitor liver function |
| **Levetiracetam (Keppra)** | 500-3000mg/day | Fewer interactions |
| **Lamotrigine (Lamictal)** | 200-400mg/day | Slow titration required |

**CRITICAL:** Missing doses increases seizure risk. Keep 1-week backup supply.

**Medication storage:**
- Room temperature (59-77°F)
- Protect from moisture (airtight container)
- Avoid extreme heat (>90°F degrades medication)

**Rationing if supply limited:**
- DO NOT skip doses (rebound seizures)
- Reduce to minimum effective dose if must ration
- Increase seizure precautions (avoid triggers, never alone)

---

## Postictal State (After Seizure)

**Normal post-seizure symptoms (resolve in 10-30 min):**
- Confusion, disorientation
- Fatigue, sleepiness
- Headache
- Muscle soreness
- Amnesia (doesn't remember seizure)

**Concerning post-seizure signs (seek help):**
- Confusion lasting >30 min (prolonged postictal)
- Weakness on one side (Todd's paralysis, usually resolves but mimics stroke)
- Another seizure within 30 min (cluster seizures)
- Difficulty breathing
- Injury (head trauma, fracture, dislocation)

---

## Triggers to Avoid

**Common seizure triggers:**
- **Sleep deprivation** (most common trigger, get 7-9 hours/night)
- **Flashing lights** (photosensitive epilepsy, 3% of patients)
- **Stress** (physical, emotional)
- **Alcohol** (both intoxication and withdrawal)
- **Illness** (fever, infection)
- **Missed medications**
- **Menstruation** (hormonal changes)
- **Low blood sugar** (hypoglycemia)

**Avoidance strategies:**
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Avoid strobe lights, rapid flickering
- Stress management techniques
- NO alcohol (lowers seizure threshold)
- Take medications on time
- Treat infections early

---

## Safety Precautions

**High-risk activities (modify or avoid):**
- Swimming (never alone, use life jacket)
- Bathing (shower safer than bath, leave door unlocked)
- Driving (seizure-free for 3-12 months depending on state law)
- Heights (ladders, roofs, cliffs)
- Heavy machinery
- Open flames (cooking, campfires)

**Safety modifications:**
- Medical ID bracelet (epilepsy, emergency contact)
- Seizure action plan (what to do, when to call 911)
- Inform family/friends/coworkers (seizure first aid)
- Avoid swimming alone, use buddy system
- Carpet floors (reduces injury from falls)

## When to Seek Help

**Call 911 / evacuate immediately if:**
- **First seizure ever** (needs evaluation for cause)
- **Seizure lasts >5 minutes** (status epilepticus)
- **Multiple seizures without regaining consciousness** (cluster seizures)
- **Injury during seizure** (head trauma, fracture)
- **Seizure in water** (drowning risk)
- **Difficulty breathing after seizure**
- **Pregnant** (seizures can harm fetus)
- **Diabetes** (may be hypoglycemia, not seizure)

**Seek medical attention within 24 hours if:**
- Seizure different than usual (longer, more severe)
- Confusion lasting >30 min after seizure
- Multiple seizures in one day (breakthrough seizures)
- Running out of medication

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Putting objects in mouth:** Can break teeth, cause choking, no benefit
2. ❌ **Restraining person:** Can cause fractures, dislocations
3. ❌ **Not timing seizure:** Critical info for determining if status epilepticus
4. ❌ **Assuming epilepsy = low intelligence:** Most people with epilepsy have normal intelligence
5. ❌ **Skipping medications when seizure-free:** Seizures can return suddenly

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **Seizure first aid:** Protect head, turn on side, time duration, DO NOT restrain or put objects in mouth
2. ✅ **Status epilepticus = emergency:** Seizure >5 min needs rescue medications and evacuation
3. ✅ **Medication consistency critical:** Missing doses increases seizure risk significantly
4. ✅ **Sleep deprivation = common trigger:** Get 7-9 hours/night to reduce seizure risk
5. ✅ **Postictal confusion normal:** 10-30 min post-seizure confusion expected, >30 min = seek help

**Most seizures are brief and self-limiting. Proper first aid prevents injury and saves lives.**
