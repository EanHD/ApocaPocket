# Pregnancy Complications & Emergency Protocols

## Overview

6 million pregnancies yearly in US. Complications affect 15-30% of pregnancies, can be life-threatening for mother and baby.

**CRITICAL:** Pregnancy complications can escalate rapidly. Early recognition saves lives.

## Pre-eclampsia (Most Common Serious Complication)

### Recognition

**Blood pressure thresholds:**
- **Concerning:** ≥140/90 mmHg (persistent, two readings 4+ hours apart)
- **Severe:** ≥160/110 mmHg
- **Emergency:** ≥180/120 mmHg + symptoms

**Classic triad:** Hypertension + proteinuria + edema (swelling)

**Symptoms:**
- Severe headache (unrelieved by medication)
- Vision changes (blurred, spots, flashing lights, temporary blindness)
- Upper abdominal pain (especially right upper quadrant, liver involvement)
- Sudden severe swelling (face, hands, feet)
- Nausea/vomiting (late pregnancy, not morning sickness)
- Shortness of breath (pulmonary edema)
- Decreased urination (<500mL/day)

**Risk factors:**
- First pregnancy
- Age <18 or >35
- Multiple pregnancy (twins+)
- Previous pre-eclampsia
- Chronic hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease
- Obesity (BMI >30)

### Treatment Protocol

**Mild pre-eclampsia (140-160/90-110, no severe symptoms):**
1. **Bed rest** (left side lying, improves placental blood flow)
2. **Monitor BP** every 4-6 hours
3. **Reduce salt intake** (limit to 2g/day)
4. **Monitor fetal movement** (kick counts: ≥10 movements in 2 hours normal)
5. **Evacuate within 24-48 hours** (not immediate emergency but needs medical evaluation)

**Severe pre-eclampsia (≥160/110 or severe symptoms):**
1. **Position:** Left side lying (improves blood flow to placenta)
2. **Magnesium sulfate** (if available): 4-6g IV loading dose, prevents seizures
3. **Blood pressure management:** Labetalol or hydralazine (if available, medical supervision required)
4. **EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY** (delivery may be needed to save mother)

⚠️ **DANGER SIGNS (Imminent eclampsia/seizure):**
- Severe headache + vision changes
- Right upper quadrant pain
- Altered consciousness
- Hyperreflexia (exaggerated reflexes)

---

## Eclampsia (Seizures from Pre-eclampsia)

**Definition:** Pre-eclampsia + seizures (life-threatening)

**Recognition:**
- Tonic-clonic seizure (convulsions, loss of consciousness)
- Preceded by pre-eclampsia symptoms (but 40% have NO warning)
- Can occur before, during, or after delivery (up to 6 weeks postpartum)

**Emergency management:**
1. **Protect airway:** Turn on left side, prevent aspiration
2. **Protect from injury:** Pad head, remove dangerous objects
3. **DO NOT restrain** or put objects in mouth
4. **Time the seizure** (if >5 min = status epilepticus)
5. **Magnesium sulfate** (if available): 4-6g IV bolus, then 2g/hr infusion
6. **After seizure:** Recovery position (left side), monitor breathing
7. **EVACUATE URGENTLY** (maternal mortality 1-2%, fetal mortality 10-20%)

**Post-seizure management:**
- Keep on left side (prevent aspiration, improve placental perfusion)
- Supplemental oxygen if available (8-10 L/min via non-rebreather)
- Monitor closely for repeat seizures (60% have multiple seizures)
- Delivery is definitive treatment (only cure for eclampsia)

---

## HELLP Syndrome (Severe Pre-eclampsia Variant)

**Acronym:** Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets

**Recognition:**
- Right upper quadrant pain (liver capsule distension)
- Nausea/vomiting (not morning sickness)
- Malaise, fatigue (nonspecific)
- May have NO hypertension (10-15% normotensive)

**Danger signs:**
- Bleeding (nose, gums, injection sites) - low platelets
- Jaundice (yellowing skin/eyes) - liver damage
- Confusion, seizures - severe complication

**Treatment:**
- **EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY** (maternal mortality 1%, fetal mortality 10-30%)
- Deliver baby (only definitive treatment)
- Blood transfusion if severe bleeding
- Magnesium sulfate for seizure prevention

---

## Ectopic Pregnancy (Medical Emergency)

**Definition:** Pregnancy implanted outside uterus (usually fallopian tube)

**Incidence:** 1-2% of pregnancies

**Recognition:**
- **Classic triad:** Abdominal pain + vaginal bleeding + missed period
- **Sharp, stabbing abdominal pain** (usually one-sided)
- **Shoulder pain** (referred pain from ruptured ectopic, blood irritating diaphragm)
- Dizziness, fainting (internal bleeding, shock)

**Risk factors:**
- Previous ectopic pregnancy (10x risk)
- Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
- Tubal surgery
- IUD use
- Endometriosis

**Ruptured ectopic (life-threatening):**
- Sudden severe abdominal pain
- Shoulder pain (blood irritating diaphragm)
- Signs of shock (pale, cold, rapid pulse, low BP)
- Internal bleeding (can lose liters of blood into abdomen)

**Emergency management:**
1. **Recognize shock:** Pale, cold, rapid pulse (>100), low BP
2. **Position:** Lay flat, elevate legs 12 inches (shock position)
3. **Keep warm:** Blankets, prevent hypothermia
4. **DO NOT give fluids by mouth** (surgery may be needed)
5. **EVACUATE URGENTLY** (ruptured ectopic = surgical emergency, mortality 1-3%)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Ectopic pregnancy cannot be saved. Attempting to continue pregnancy is fatal.

## Miscarriage (Spontaneous Abortion)

**Incidence:** 10-20% of known pregnancies, 80% before 12 weeks

### Types of Miscarriage

| Type | Definition | Bleeding | Cervix | Management |
|------|------------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Threatened** | Bleeding, pregnancy may continue | Light | Closed | Bed rest, monitor |
| **Inevitable** | Bleeding, pregnancy will not continue | Moderate-heavy | Open | Evacuate, may need D&C |
| **Incomplete** | Some tissue passed, some remains | Heavy | Open | D&C or misoprostol |
| **Complete** | All tissue passed | Decreasing | Closing | Monitor for infection |
| **Missed** | Fetus died, no symptoms | None or light | Closed | D&C or misoprostol |

### Management

**Early miscarriage (<12 weeks):**
1. **Monitor bleeding:** Soak >2 pads/hour = heavy bleeding (evacuate)
2. **Pain management:** Ibuprofen 600mg every 6 hours
3. **Pass tissue:** Cramping, passing clots/tissue normal
4. **Infection risk:** Fever >100.4°F, foul-smelling discharge, severe pain = infection

**Late miscarriage (12-20 weeks):**
- Higher bleeding risk (larger placenta)
- May require D&C (dilation and curettage)
- Infection risk higher
- **Evacuate if:** Heavy bleeding, fever, severe pain

**Complications:**
- **Hemorrhage:** >500mL blood loss, shock
- **Infection:** Septic abortion (10% mortality if untreated)
- **Retained products:** Tissue remains, causes infection/bleeding

**⚠️ EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY if:**
- Soaking >2 pads per hour
- Passing large clots (golf ball size+)
- Fever >100.4°F
- Severe pain unrelieved by medication
- Signs of shock (pale, rapid pulse, confusion)

## Preterm Labor (Before 37 Weeks)

**Definition:** Labor contractions causing cervical change before 37 weeks

**Recognition:**
- **Regular contractions** (≥4 per hour, ≥8 per 20 minutes)
- **Cervical changes** (dilation, effacement)
- Pelvic pressure (baby "dropping")
- Low back pain (constant, rhythmic)
- Vaginal discharge change (mucus, blood-tinged "bloody show")
- Fluid leak (premature rupture of membranes)

**Risk factors:**
- Previous preterm birth (30% recurrence)
- Multiple pregnancy (twins: 50% preterm, triplets: 90% preterm)
- Infection (UTI, bacterial vaginosis)
- Cervical insufficiency
- Smoking, drug use

**Management:**
1. **Hydration:** Drink 500mL water (dehydration can trigger contractions)
2. **Empty bladder:** Full bladder can trigger contractions
3. **Rest:** Lie on left side (improves placental blood flow)
4. **Monitor contractions:** Time frequency and duration
5. **Tocolytics** (if available, medical supervision): Nifedipine, terbutaline (stop contractions)
6. **Steroids** (if 24-34 weeks, medical supervision): Betamethasone (mature fetal lungs)

**Viability:**
- **<24 weeks:** Non-viable (survival <10%)
- **24-28 weeks:** Marginal viability (survival 50-70%, high disability risk)
- **28-32 weeks:** Good viability (survival 90-95%, moderate disability risk)
- **32-37 weeks:** Excellent viability (survival >95%, low disability risk)

**EVACUATE if:**
- Contractions continuing despite hydration/rest
- Fluid leak (premature rupture of membranes, infection risk)
- Bleeding
- <34 weeks (baby may need NICU)

## Placental Abruption (Placenta Separates Early)

**Recognition:**
- **Sudden severe abdominal pain** (constant, board-like rigid abdomen)
- **Vaginal bleeding** (dark red blood, may be absent if bleeding internal)
- **Fetal distress** (decreased movement)
- **Shock** (if heavy bleeding)

**Risk factors:**
- Trauma (car crash, fall, domestic violence)
- Hypertension, pre-eclampsia
- Smoking, cocaine use
- Previous abruption (10% recurrence)

**Severity:**
- **Grade 1 (mild):** <10% separation, light bleeding
- **Grade 2 (moderate):** 10-50% separation, moderate bleeding, fetal distress
- **Grade 3 (severe):** >50% separation, heavy bleeding, fetal death

**Emergency management:**
1. **Shock protocol:** Lay flat, elevate legs, keep warm
2. **DO NOT give fluids by mouth** (surgery likely needed)
3. **Monitor fetal movement** (decreased = fetal distress)
4. **EVACUATE URGENTLY** (maternal mortality 1%, fetal mortality 10-50% depending on severity)

---

## Placenta Previa (Placenta Covers Cervix)

**Recognition:**
- **Painless vaginal bleeding** (bright red blood)
- Usually occurs in 2nd-3rd trimester
- Bleeding may stop and restart
- NO abdominal pain (vs abruption with severe pain)

**Management:**
1. **DO NOT perform vaginal exam** (can trigger massive bleeding)
2. **Monitor bleeding:** Amount, frequency
3. **Rest, no activity** (no sex, no heavy lifting)
4. **EVACUATE if bleeding heavy** (>1 pad per hour)

**Delivery:** Cesarean section required (vaginal delivery fatal)

---

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Ignoring "minor" symptoms:** Vision changes + headache = pre-eclampsia emergency
2. ❌ **Assuming all bleeding is miscarriage:** Could be ectopic (life-threatening)
3. ❌ **Not checking BP regularly:** Pre-eclampsia can develop rapidly (24-48 hours)
4. ❌ **Delaying evacuation for ectopic:** Ruptured ectopic = surgical emergency
5. ❌ **Vaginal exam with placenta previa:** Can trigger massive bleeding
6. ❌ **Ignoring decreased fetal movement:** Sign of fetal distress

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **Pre-eclampsia thresholds:** ≥140/90 = concerning, ≥160/110 = severe, ≥180/120 + symptoms = emergency
2. ✅ **Eclampsia = seizures:** Magnesium sulfate, left side position, evacuate urgently
3. ✅ **Ectopic triad:** Abdominal pain + vaginal bleeding + missed period, shoulder pain = rupture (life-threatening)
4. ✅ **Miscarriage bleeding:** >2 pads/hour = hemorrhage, evacuate immediately
5. ✅ **Preterm labor:** ≥4 contractions/hour before 37 weeks, hydration + rest + evacuate if continuing

**Pregnancy complications can be life-threatening but are manageable with early recognition and evacuation.**
