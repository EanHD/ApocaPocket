# Sepsis Recognition & Treatment

## Overview

Sepsis kills 270,000 Americans yearly. **40% mortality without ICU care.** Early recognition + antibiotics + fluids = survival.

**CRITICAL:** Sepsis can progress from infection to death in 12-24 hours. Every hour of delayed treatment increases mortality by 8%.

---

## What is Sepsis?

**Infection → SIRS → Sepsis → Severe Sepsis → Septic Shock → Death**

**Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS):**
- Body's overwhelming response to infection
- Cytokine storm (immune system overdrive)
- Organ damage from inflammation (not just infection)

**Sepsis = SIRS + confirmed or suspected infection**

---

## qSOFA (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment)

**Rapid bedside screening (score 0-3):**

| Criteria | Normal | Abnormal (1 point) |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Respiratory rate** | <22/min | ≥22/min |
| **Altered mental status** | Alert | Confused, drowsy, agitated |
| **Systolic blood pressure** | ≥100 mmHg | <100 mmHg |

**Score interpretation:**
- **0-1:** Low risk of sepsis (but still monitor if infected)
- **2-3:** HIGH RISK of sepsis (40-50% mortality), evacuate urgently

**Field use:** ANY 2 criteria = assume sepsis, start treatment immediately

---

## SIRS Criteria (More Sensitive)

**≥2 of the following = SIRS:**

| Criteria | Abnormal Value |
|----------|---------------|
| **Temperature** | >100.4°F (38°C) OR <96.8°F (36°C) |
| **Heart rate** | >90 bpm |
| **Respiratory rate** | >20/min |
| **White blood cell count** | >12,000 OR <4,000 OR >10% immature cells |

**SIRS + infection = sepsis**

---

## Common Infection Sources

**Respiratory (35% of sepsis cases):**
- Pneumonia (bacterial, viral)
- Lung abscess
- Empyema (pus in pleural space)

**Urinary (25%):**
- UTI (bladder infection)
- Pyelonephritis (kidney infection)
- Prostatitis (men)

**Abdominal (20%):**
- Appendicitis (ruptured)
- Cholecystitis (gallbladder infection)
- Diverticulitis (colon infection)
- Peritonitis (abdominal cavity infection)

**Skin/Soft Tissue (10%):**
- Cellulitis (deep skin infection)
- Abscess (pus collection)
- Necrotizing fasciitis ("flesh-eating bacteria")
- Burn infections

**Other (10%):**
- Meningitis (brain/spinal fluid infection)
- Septic arthritis (joint infection)
- Endocarditis (heart valve infection)
- Catheter/IV line infection

## Recognition by Stage

### Stage 1: SIRS (Early)
**Symptoms:**
- Fever >100.4°F or hypothermia <96.8°F
- Fast heart rate >90 bpm
- Fast breathing >20/min
- Known or suspected infection

**Treatment:**
- Identify infection source
- Start antibiotics within 1 hour
- Hydration (oral or IV)

### Stage 2: Sepsis
**Symptoms (SIRS + organ dysfunction):**
- Altered mental status (confusion, drowsiness)
- Low blood pressure (systolic <100)
- Decreased urine output (<0.5mL/kg/hr)
- Rapid breathing (≥22/min)
- High lactate (>2 mmol/L, if testable)

**Treatment:**
- Aggressive antibiotics (IV preferred)
- Aggressive IV fluids (30mL/kg in first 3 hours)
- Oxygen if available
- **EVACUATE URGENTLY** (20-30% mortality even with treatment)

### Stage 3: Severe Sepsis
**Symptoms (sepsis + organ failure):**
- Acute kidney injury (no urine output)
- Liver dysfunction (jaundice)
- Respiratory failure (hypoxia, difficulty breathing)
- Coagulopathy (abnormal bleeding)
- Thrombocytopenia (low platelets, petechiae)

**Treatment:**
- **THIS IS ICU-LEVEL CARE**
- Multiple antibiotics (broad-spectrum)
- Vasopressors (medications to raise BP)
- Mechanical ventilation (breathing support)
- **30-40% mortality even with ICU**

### Stage 4: Septic Shock
**Symptoms (severe sepsis + refractory hypotension):**
- Blood pressure <65 mmHg despite fluids
- Requires vasopressors to maintain BP
- Lactate >4 mmol/L (severe tissue hypoxia)
- Multi-organ failure

**Treatment:**
- **ICU required**
- **40-50% mortality**

## Emergency Antibiotic Treatment (First Hour)

**"Hour-1 Bundle":** Antibiotics + fluids within 60 minutes

### Antibiotic Choices (Field Setting)

**Broad-spectrum coverage (unknown source):**

| Antibiotic | Dose | Covers | Notes |
|------------|------|--------|-------|
| **Amoxicillin-clavulanate** | 875/125mg PO every 12hr | Gram+, Gram-, anaerobes | Best oral option |
| **Ciprofloxacin + Metronidazole** | Cipro 500mg + Metro 500mg every 12hr | Gram-, anaerobes | Good for abdominal |
| **Doxycycline** | 100mg every 12hr | Gram+, Gram-, atypicals | Backup option |
| **Azithromycin + Amoxicillin** | Azithro 500mg + Amox 500mg | Respiratory coverage | For pneumonia |

**Specific infection sources:**

| Source | First Choice | Second Choice |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Pneumonia** | Amoxicillin-clav 875mg q12h + azithromycin 500mg daily | Doxycycline 100mg q12h |
| **UTI** | Ciprofloxacin 500mg q12h | Trimethoprim-sulfa DS q12h |
| **Skin/soft tissue** | Amoxicillin-clav 875mg q12h | Doxycycline 100mg q12h + metronidazole 500mg q8h |
| **Abdominal** | Cipro 500mg + metro 500mg q12h | Amoxicillin-clav 875mg q12h |

**IV antibiotics (if available):**
- Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily
- Piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV every 6hr
- Vancomycin 15mg/kg IV every 12hr (for MRSA)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Antibiotics MUST be started within 1 hour. Every hour delay increases mortality by 8%.

## Fluid Resuscitation (Critical!)

**"30mL/kg in first 3 hours":**
- **Example:** 70kg (154lb) person needs 2.1 liters in first 3 hours
- **Example:** 100kg (220lb) person needs 3 liters in first 3 hours

**Fluid types:**
- **IV crystalloids (preferred):** Normal saline, Lactated Ringer's
- **Oral rehydration (if no IV):** ORS solution, water + salt + sugar
  - Recipe: 1L water + 6 tsp sugar + ½ tsp salt

**Fluid administration:**
- First liter in 30 minutes (rapid bolus)
- Continue 500mL per hour for next 2 hours
- Reassess after 3 hours (if BP still low, may need more)

**Signs of adequate resuscitation:**
- Blood pressure improving (systolic >90)
- Heart rate decreasing (<100)
- Urine output >0.5mL/kg/hr (30-50mL/hr for average adult)
- Mental status improving (less confused)

⚠️ **WARNING:** Too much fluid can cause pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs). Stop if breathing worsens, crackles in lungs, coughing up pink frothy sputum.

---

## Source Control (Find and Fix Infection)

**Identify the source:**
1. **Pneumonia:** Cough, chest pain, lung crackles
2. **UTI:** Flank pain, painful urination, foul urine
3. **Abdominal:** Severe abdominal pain, rigid abdomen
4. **Skin:** Redness, swelling, pus, warmth
5. **Catheter/IV:** Redness at site, pus

**Source control measures:**
- **Abscess:** Drain pus (incision & drainage)
- **Catheter/IV line:** Remove infected line
- **Appendicitis:** Surgery (appendectomy)
- **Cholecystitis:** Surgery (cholecystectomy)
- **Necrotizing fasciitis:** Urgent surgical debridement

**Without source control, antibiotics alone often fail.**

---

## Signs of Organ Failure

**Kidney failure:**
- Urine output <400mL/day (<0.5mL/kg/hr)
- Dark, concentrated urine
- Swelling (edema) in legs, feet

**Liver failure:**
- Jaundice (yellowing skin, eyes)
- Confusion (hepatic encephalopathy)
- Easy bruising (coagulopathy)

**Respiratory failure:**
- Oxygen saturation <90% despite oxygen
- Rapid breathing (>30/min)
- Using accessory muscles (ribs, neck)

**Cardiovascular failure:**
- Blood pressure <65 mmHg (despite fluids)
- Cold, clammy extremities (poor perfusion)
- Weak, thready pulse

**Coagulation failure:**
- Petechiae (small red dots on skin)
- Purpura (larger purple spots)
- Bleeding from gums, nose, injection sites

---

## Lactate (Tissue Hypoxia Marker)

**If lactate testing available:**
- **Normal:** <2 mmol/L
- **Elevated:** 2-4 mmol/L (sepsis, needs monitoring)
- **High:** >4 mmol/L (septic shock, 40-50% mortality)

**Field assessment (without lactate test):**
- **Good perfusion:** Warm extremities, capillary refill <2 sec, normal mental status
- **Poor perfusion:** Cold extremities, capillary refill >2 sec, confusion (assume high lactate)

---

## Evacuation Priorities

**EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY if:**
- qSOFA ≥2 (respiratory rate ≥22, altered mental status, BP <100)
- Fever + 2+ SIRS criteria
- Suspected sepsis with organ dysfunction
- Septic shock (BP <65 despite fluids)

**Transport considerations:**
- Start antibiotics BEFORE evacuation (if possible)
- IV fluids en route (if able)
- Keep warm (hypothermia worsens sepsis)
- Monitor vital signs closely

---

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Delaying antibiotics to "find the source":** Start antibiotics within 1 hour, identify source later
2. ❌ **Inadequate fluid resuscitation:** 30mL/kg is A LOT of fluid (2-3 liters), don't under-resuscitate
3. ❌ **Ignoring altered mental status:** Confusion = organ dysfunction = sepsis, not "just a UTI"
4. ❌ **Assuming "normal" vitals rule out sepsis:** Young, healthy people compensate well, then crash suddenly
5. ❌ **Not removing infected foreign bodies:** Catheters, IV lines can cause sepsis even with antibiotics

---

## Prevention

**Infection prevention:**
- Wound care (clean, irrigate, dress properly)
- Hand hygiene (prevents transmission)
- Early treatment of infections (don't let UTI become pyelonephritis)
- Remove unnecessary catheters/IV lines

**High-risk groups:**
- Elderly (>65)
- Immunocompromised (diabetes, HIV, cancer)
- Recent surgery or trauma
- Chronic illness (kidney disease, liver disease)

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **qSOFA ≥2 = sepsis:** Respiratory rate ≥22, altered mental status, BP <100
2. ✅ **Hour-1 bundle:** Antibiotics + fluids within 60 minutes (every hour delay = 8% higher mortality)
3. ✅ **30mL/kg fluids in 3 hours:** 2-3 liters for average adult, aggressive resuscitation
4. ✅ **Broad-spectrum antibiotics:** Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg q12h (first-line oral)
5. ✅ **Source control:** Find and fix the infection (drain abscess, remove catheter)

**Sepsis is a time-critical emergency. Recognize early, treat aggressively, evacuate urgently.**
