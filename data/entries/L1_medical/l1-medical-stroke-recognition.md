# Stroke Recognition & Response (FAST)

## Overview

Stroke is the #5 cause of death and #1 cause of long-term disability. **"Time is brain":** 2 million brain cells die per minute during a stroke.

**CRITICAL:** Treatment within 3-4.5 hours can prevent permanent damage or death. Every second counts.

---

## FAST Protocol (Recognize Stroke in 10 Seconds)

**F**ace drooping  
**A**rm weakness  
**S**peech difficulty  
**T**ime to call 911

### Face Drooping
**Test:** Ask person to smile
- **Normal:** Both sides of face move equally
- **Stroke:** One side droops, smile is uneven
- **Severity:** Mild droop = minor stroke, complete paralysis = severe

### Arm Weakness
**Test:** Ask person to raise both arms, close eyes
- **Normal:** Both arms stay up equally
- **Stroke:** One arm drifts downward or cannot raise at all
- **Severity:** Mild drift = minor, immediate drop = severe

### Speech Difficulty
**Test:** Ask person to repeat "You can't teach an old dog new tricks"
- **Normal:** Clear, understandable speech
- **Stroke:** Slurred speech (dysarthria) OR wrong words/nonsense (aphasia)
- **Severity:** Mild slurring = minor, cannot speak = severe

### Time = Critical
**If ANY of these signs present:**
- Note the TIME symptoms started (critical for treatment decisions)
- Call 911 / evacuate IMMEDIATELY
- Do NOT wait to "see if it improves"

---

## BE-FAST (Extended Protocol - More Sensitive)

**B**alance loss  
**E**ye vision changes  
**F**ace drooping  
**A**rm weakness  
**S**peech difficulty  
**T**ime to call 911

### Balance Loss
- Sudden dizziness, loss of coordination
- Unable to walk straight
- Stumbling, falling to one side

### Eye Vision Changes
- Sudden vision loss (one or both eyes)
- Double vision (diplopia)
- Visual field cut (can't see left or right side)
- Blurred vision

**Why it matters:** 10-15% of strokes present with ONLY balance/vision changes (no face/arm/speech symptoms)

---

## Hemorrhagic vs Ischemic Stroke

### Ischemic Stroke (87% of strokes)
**Cause:** Blood clot blocks artery to brain  
**Symptoms:** Gradual onset (minutes to hours)  
**Treatment:** Clot-busting drugs (tPA), aspirin  
**Mortality:** 10-15%

### Hemorrhagic Stroke (13% of strokes)
**Cause:** Blood vessel ruptures, bleeding in/around brain  
**Symptoms:** **Sudden severe headache** ("worst headache of my life"), rapid onset  
**Treatment:** Surgery, blood pressure control, **NO aspirin** (makes bleeding worse)  
**Mortality:** 40-50%

**Key differentiators:**

| Feature | Ischemic | Hemorrhagic |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Onset** | Gradual (minutes) | Sudden (<1 minute) |
| **Headache** | Mild or absent | **Severe, sudden ("thunderclap")** |
| **Vomiting** | Rare | Common |
| **Neck stiffness** | Absent | Present (blood irritates meninges) |
| **Altered consciousness** | Later | Early |
| **Seizures** | Rare | 10-20% of cases |

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** If sudden severe headache + vomiting + altered consciousness, assume hemorrhagic stroke. **DO NOT give aspirin.**

---

## When to Give Aspirin (VERY IMPORTANT)

**Aspirin is ONLY for ischemic stroke** (87% of strokes)  
**Aspirin KILLS if given for hemorrhagic stroke** (13% of strokes)

**Give aspirin if:**
- Classic FAST symptoms (face/arm/speech)
- NO severe headache
- NO vomiting
- Gradual onset (minutes to hours)
- **Likely ischemic stroke** (87% probability)

**DO NOT give aspirin if:**
- **Sudden severe "thunderclap" headache**
- Vomiting
- Neck stiffness
- Rapid onset (<1 minute)
- Altered consciousness early
- **Possible hemorrhagic stroke**

**Aspirin dosing (if giving):**
- **325mg chewed immediately** (same as heart attack)
- Effect starts in 5-10 minutes
- **ONLY give if confident it's ischemic** (no severe headache)

---

## Time Windows for Treatment

**tPA (Clot-Busting Drug):**
- **Window:** 3-4.5 hours from symptom onset
- **Effect:** Dissolves clot, restores blood flow
- **Outcome:** 30% better recovery if given within 3 hours
- **Risk:** 6% risk of hemorrhagic conversion (clot treatment causes bleeding)

**Mechanical Thrombectomy (Clot Removal):**
- **Window:** Up to 24 hours from symptom onset (for large vessel occlusion)
- **Effect:** Catheter removes clot directly
- **Outcome:** 50% better recovery if done within 6 hours

**Aspirin:**
- **Window:** Within 48 hours (but earlier is better)
- **Effect:** Prevents clot growth, reduces recurrence
- **Outcome:** 13% reduction in early recurrence

**"Golden Hour" (First 60 Minutes):**
- Best chance for full recovery
- Every 15-minute delay = 4% worse outcome
- **Brain cells dying:** 1.9 million/minute

## Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (Simplified)

**3 tests, score 0-3:**

1. **Facial droop:**
   - 0 = Normal (both sides equal)
   - 1 = Abnormal (one side droops)

2. **Arm drift:**
   - 0 = Normal (both arms stay up)
   - 1 = Abnormal (one arm drifts down)

3. **Speech:**
   - 0 = Normal (clear, correct words)
   - 1 = Abnormal (slurred OR wrong words)

**Score interpretation:**
- **0:** No stroke signs (but still monitor, symptoms can develop)
- **1:** Possible stroke (72% probability)
- **2:** Probable stroke (85% probability)
- **3:** Definite stroke (97% probability)

**Field use:** ANY abnormality = evacuate immediately

## Positioning & Management (First 30 Minutes)

### Head Elevation

**Ischemic stroke (most likely):**
- **Elevate head 30 degrees** (semi-reclined)
- Improves venous drainage from brain
- Reduces intracranial pressure

**Hemorrhagic stroke (suspected):**
- **Elevate head 30 degrees** (same positioning)
- Reduces bleeding pressure
- Prevents aspiration if vomiting

**DO NOT lay flat:**
- Increases intracranial pressure
- Worsens brain swelling
- Higher risk of aspiration

### Blood Pressure Management

**DO NOT lower blood pressure acutely:**
- Brain is trying to perfuse itself (high BP is compensatory)
- Lowering BP can extend stroke damage
- Exception: BP >220/120 with active bleeding (hemorrhagic)

**Allow permissive hypertension:**
- Systolic BP 140-180 is acceptable
- Body's natural response to stroke
- Medical team will lower gradually in hospital

### Glucose Management

**Avoid hypoglycemia:**
- Check blood sugar if diabetic
- If <70 mg/dL, give 15g carbs
- Low blood sugar worsens brain damage

**Avoid hyperglycemia:**
- If >180 mg/dL, give insulin (if available)
- High blood sugar worsens outcomes

### Seizure Management (If Occurs)

**10-20% of hemorrhagic strokes have seizures:**
1. Protect head from injury
2. Turn on side (recovery position)
3. Time the seizure (if >5 min = status epilepticus, medical emergency)
4. DO NOT restrain or put objects in mouth
5. After seizure: keep on side, monitor breathing

- **0:** No stroke
- **1-4:** Minor stroke
- **5-15:** Moderate stroke
- **16-20:** Moderate to severe
- **21-42:** Severe stroke

**Field use:** Higher score = worse stroke, evacuate urgently

## Stroke vs Other Conditions

### Stroke vs Migraine with Aura

| Feature | Migraine | Stroke |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Onset** | Gradual (5-20 min) | Sudden (<5 min) |
| **Visual symptoms** | Zigzag lines, flashing lights | Vision loss, double vision |
| **Headache** | Severe, throbbing (after aura) | Mild or absent (unless hemorrhagic) |
| **History** | Previous migraines | No migraine history OR different than usual |
| **Age** | Usually <50 | Usually >50 |

**⚠️ RULE:** If different than previous migraines OR first migraine after age 50, assume stroke.

### Stroke vs Bell's Palsy (Facial Paralysis)

| Feature | Bell's Palsy | Stroke |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Forehead involvement** | YES (can't wrinkle forehead) | NO (can still wrinkle forehead) |
| **Arm/leg weakness** | None | Present |
| **Speech** | Normal | Slurred or wrong words |
| **Eye closure** | Cannot close eye | Can close eye |

**Key:** Bell's palsy affects ENTIRE face (forehead + lower face), stroke affects ONLY lower face (forehead spared)

## Permanent Damage Timeline

**"Time is brain":**

| Time | Brain Cells Lost | Damage Equivalent |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| **1 minute** | 1.9 million cells | 3.6 weeks of normal aging |
| **1 hour** | 120 million cells | 3.6 years of aging |
| **3 hours** | 360 million cells | 10.8 years of aging |
| **6 hours** | 720 million cells | 21.6 years of aging |

**Every 15-minute delay:**
- 4% less likely to walk independently
- 4% more likely to die
- 30 million more brain cells lost

---

## Evacuation Priorities

**EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY if:**
- ANY FAST or BE-FAST symptom present
- Sudden severe headache ("worst of my life")
- Sudden vision loss, double vision
- Sudden dizziness, inability to walk
- Sudden confusion, difficulty understanding speech

**Transport considerations:**
- Note EXACT time symptoms started (critical for tPA decision)
- Elevate head 30 degrees
- Position on affected side (prevents aspiration if vomiting)
- Monitor level of consciousness closely
- Be ready for seizures (10-20% risk in hemorrhagic stroke)

**DO NOT:**
- Give food or drink (aspiration risk)
- Lower blood pressure (unless >220/120)
- Wait to "see if it improves" (every minute = more damage)

---

## Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Assuming "it's just a migraine":** Stroke can mimic migraine, especially in younger people
2. ❌ **Giving aspirin to hemorrhagic stroke:** Worsens bleeding, increases mortality
3. ❌ **Waiting to see if symptoms resolve:** TIA (mini-stroke) often resolves in minutes, but 40% have full stroke within 90 days
4. ❌ **Lying patient flat:** Increases intracranial pressure, risk of aspiration
5. ❌ **Lowering blood pressure acutely:** Body needs high BP to perfuse brain
6. ❌ **Ignoring "minor" symptoms:** Small strokes are warning signs of larger strokes

---

## TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) - "Mini-Stroke"

**Definition:** Stroke symptoms that resolve within 24 hours (usually <1 hour)

**Why it matters:**
- 40% have full stroke within 90 days
- 20% have full stroke within 48 hours
- TIA is a medical emergency (stroke prevention window)

**Treatment:**
- Same as stroke (aspirin, evacuation)
- Start preventive meds (aspirin, statin, BP meds)
- Identify cause (carotid stenosis, atrial fibrillation)

**DO NOT ignore TIA:**
- "Mini-stroke" is a WARNING
- Next stroke may be fatal or disabling
- Early treatment prevents full stroke

---

## Prevention (Long-Term)

**Risk factors:**
- Hypertension (most important modifiable risk)
- Atrial fibrillation (5x stroke risk)
- Diabetes
- High cholesterol
- Smoking (doubles risk)
- Obesity
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Age (risk doubles each decade after 55)

**Prevention strategies:**
- Control blood pressure (<120/80)
- Aspirin 81mg daily (if high risk)
- Statin (cholesterol-lowering)
- Treat atrial fibrillation (blood thinners)
- Stop smoking (reduces risk by 50% within 2 years)
- Exercise 30 min/day, 5 days/week

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **FAST protocol:** Face, Arm, Speech, Time - ANY abnormality = stroke, evacuate immediately
2. ✅ **"Time is brain":** 2 million brain cells die per minute, every 15 minutes delay = 4% worse outcome
3. ✅ **Aspirin ONLY if ischemic:** 325mg chewed, but NOT if severe headache (hemorrhagic risk)
4. ✅ **Elevate head 30 degrees:** Reduces intracranial pressure, prevents aspiration
5. ✅ **DO NOT lower BP acutely:** Brain needs high BP to perfuse, lowering worsens damage
6. ✅ **TIA is emergency:** 40% have full stroke within 90 days, treat same as stroke

**Stroke is preventable and treatable if caught early. Know FAST, act immediately, and you can save a brain.**
