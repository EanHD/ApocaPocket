# Ice & Snow Melting for Water

## Overview
Do **not** eat snow directly. Melt and treat water efficiently to avoid hypothermia and fuel waste.

## Key Ratios
- Loose snow can yield roughly **10:1** snow-to-water volume.
- Dense snow/ice yields better (as low as 3:1 to 2:1).

## Fuel-Efficient Melting
1. Start with a small amount of liquid water in pot.
2. Add snow/ice gradually in layers.
3. Stir to avoid scorching and improve transfer.
4. Keep lid on when possible.

## Collection Quality
- Prefer clean, upper-layer snow away from roads/trails.
- Avoid colored/contaminated snow.
- Prefer clear ice over slushy roadside accumulations.

## Treatment
After melting, still disinfect when contamination risk exists:
- Boil (rolling boil 1 min; higher altitudes adjust longer).
- Filter + chemical treatment when fuel is limited.

## Hydration Targets
- Cold weather still requires regular intake: often **2–4 L/day** depending on exertion.
- Warm sweet fluids improve compliance and heat retention.

## Common Mistakes
- Eating snow directly.
- Melting dry snow in empty pot (burn risk, poor efficiency).
- Underestimating daily fluid needs in cold.

## Summary
Efficient snow/ice water production depends on clean collection, staged melting, and proper treatment.
