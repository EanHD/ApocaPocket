# Mass Casualty Triage — START System for Disaster Response

Mass casualty events (explosions, building collapse, mass shooting, natural disaster, mass vehicle accidents) overwhelm medical resources. Triage sorts victims by priority: who needs immediate care, who can wait, who is beyond help. START (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) is the standard system. Goal: save the most lives with limited resources.

## RECOGNITION SIGNS: Mass Casualty Event

**Definition:** More victims than available medical resources can handle.
- 1 victim, 5 rescuers = normal response
- 10 victims, 2 rescuers = mass casualty

**Common Scenarios:**
- **Explosions:** Blast injuries, shrapnel, crush injuries, burns, multiple trauma
- **Building collapse:** Crush syndrome, fractures, internal injuries, trapped victims
- **Mass shooting:** Multiple gunshot wounds, bleeding, penetrating trauma
- **Vehicle accidents:** Multi-car pileups, bus crashes — blunt trauma, ejections
- **Natural disasters:** Earthquakes, tornadoes, floods — widespread injuries and trapped victims
- **Chemical/Biological:** Mass poisoning, respiratory distress in multiple victims

**Indicators You're in a Mass Casualty Situation:**
- More than 3-5 serious injuries at once
- Ongoing screaming/moaning from multiple locations
- Scattered victims over wide area
- Helpers overwhelmed (running between victims, looking lost)
- You can't reach everyone immediately

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (FIRST 5 MINUTES)

### 1. SCENE SAFETY (30 seconds)
**BEFORE approaching victims, assess:**
- [ ] **Ongoing threat?** (Active shooter, unstable building, fire, hazmat, explosion risk)
- [ ] **Safe to approach?** If NO → Call for help, wait for scene secured, or evacuate victims to safe zone
- [ ] **Personal protection?** Gloves (universal precaution), eye protection (blood splash)

**Scene safety rules:**
- Dead rescuers save nobody
- If scene is unsafe, move victims to safe area FIRST (drag by clothing, not limbs)
- Assign someone to watch for secondary events (second explosion, building shift)

### 2. CALL FOR HELP (30 seconds)
- [ ] 911 or emergency services (if functional)
- [ ] Give location, nature of incident, approximate victim count
- [ ] Request additional ambulances, fire, police as needed
- [ ] If no official response available, send runners to gather community helpers

### 3. ASSIGN ROLES (1-2 minutes)
**If you're first on scene, you're the Incident Commander until relieved.**

**Minimum roles needed:**
- **Triage Officer** (1 person): Tags victims, does NOT treat
- **Treatment Team** (2+ people): Provide life-saving interventions to RED tags
- **Walking Wounded Manager** (1 person): Organize GREEN tags (self-care, help others)
- **Runner** (1 person): Bring supplies, communicate with outside
- **Psychological First Aid** (1 person): Calm panicked bystanders, prevent additional chaos

**With more helpers, add:**
- **Delayed Care Team:** Treat YELLOW tags once all REDs stabilized
- **Family Reunification:** Track victims, connect with loved ones
- **Crowd Control:** Keep bystanders back, maintain working space

### 4. GATHER SUPPLIES (1-2 minutes)
**Immediate needs (have runners bring these):**
- [ ] Triage tags (commercial) or markers (sharpie on forehead, colored ribbons, surveyor's tape)
- [ ] Tourniquets (commercial or improvised from belts, cloth)
- [ ] Pressure bandages (gauze, t-shirts, towels)
- [ ] Blankets (shock management, warmth)
- [ ] Water (for conscious victims)
- [ ] Paper/pen (victim tracking, notes)

## START TRIAGE PROTOCOL (30 seconds per victim)

**Goal:** Rapidly categorize every victim in 30 seconds or less. Do NOT treat during initial triage (exception: open airway if not breathing).

### STEP 1: WALKING WOUNDED (15 seconds)
**YELL loudly:** "Anyone who can walk, move to [point to safe area away from scene]!"

- **ALL who walk are automatically tagged GREEN (MINOR)**
- These are your lowest priority (can wait hours)
- Assign one person to manage them (have them sit, account for them, watch for deterioration)
- **IMPORTANT:** Just because they walked doesn't mean they're uninjured (internal bleeding, concussion, fractures) — they're just not immediately life-threatening

### STEP 2-5: NON-WALKING VICTIMS (systematic assessment)

**Move through victims systematically (grid pattern or row by row). Spend 30 seconds max per victim.**

**STEP 2: BREATHING?**
- **Is victim breathing?** (Look for chest rise, listen, feel for breath)

**IF NO:**
- Open airway (head tilt-chin lift, or jaw thrust if spinal injury suspected)
- Clear obvious obstructions (blood, vomit, debris — finger sweep if visible)
- **Does victim START breathing after airway opened?**
  - **YES → Tag RED (IMMEDIATE)** — Move to next victim
  - **NO → Tag BLACK (EXPECTANT/DEAD)** — Do NOT attempt CPR in mass casualty (takes 2 people 15+ minutes = not feasible). Move to next victim.

**IF YES (breathing):**
- Proceed to Step 3

**STEP 3: RESPIRATORY RATE**
- Count breaths for 15 seconds, multiply by 4 (or estimate)
- **OVER 30 breaths/minute → Tag RED (IMMEDIATE)** — Respiratory distress, needs urgent care
- **UNDER 30 breaths/minute → Proceed to Step 4**

**STEP 4: CIRCULATION (Perfusion)**
- Check radial pulse (wrist)
- **ABSENT or VERY WEAK → Tag RED (IMMEDIATE)** — Shock, severe bleeding
- **PRESENT and strong → Proceed to Step 5**

**STEP 5: MENTAL STATUS**
- Give simple command: "Squeeze my hand" or "Stick out your tongue" or "What's your name?"
- **OBEYS command (alert, oriented) → Tag YELLOW (DELAYED)** — Serious injuries but stable
- **DOES NOT obey (confused, unresponsive, combative) → Tag RED (IMMEDIATE)** — Altered mental status indicates severe injury (head trauma, shock, hypoxia)

### TRIAGE CATEGORIES SUMMARY:

**GREEN (MINOR) — "Walking Wounded"**
- Can walk
- Minor injuries (cuts, bruises, minor fractures)
- Can wait hours for care
- **Action:** Self-care, help others, wait

**YELLOW (DELAYED) — "Urgent but Stable"**
- Serious injuries (fractures, lacerations, moderate bleeding)
- Breathing, circulation, mental status all OK
- Can wait 30 minutes to 2 hours for care
- **Action:** Stabilize, monitor, treat after all REDs addressed

**RED (IMMEDIATE) — "Life-Threatening but Saveable"**
- Airway problems (not breathing until airway opened)
- Respiratory distress (> 30 breaths/min)
- Circulatory failure (weak/no radial pulse)
- Altered mental status (not following commands)
- **Action:** Treat NOW — these patients die within minutes to hours without intervention

**BLACK (EXPECTANT/DEAD) — "Deceased or Unsaveable"**
- Not breathing even after airway opened
- Obviously dead (decapitation, massive head trauma, rigor mortis)
- Injuries incompatible with life given available resources
- **Action:** Do NOT treat. Cover body if possible. Document location. Move to next victim.

**BRUTAL REALITY:** In true mass casualty, you may tag someone BLACK who *could* be saved with full hospital resources (e.g., CPR could revive) — but in field with limited help, that 15-minute CPR means 10 other people die. This is the horrible math of triage.

## TIMELINE-BASED RESPONSE

### FIRST 15 MINUTES — RAPID TRIAGE

**All efforts go to categorizing victims.**

**Triage Officer:**
- Move through victims systematically (don't get pulled into treating)
- 30 seconds per victim maximum
- Mark triage category (tag, write on forehead with marker, colored ribbon)
- Move to next victim immediately

**Treatment Team (if available):**
- Stand by, organize supplies
- Do NOT start treating until triage officer gives signal (all REDs identified)

**Walking Wounded Manager:**
- Account for GREEN tags (count them, get names if possible)
- Assess for hidden injuries (check for bleeding under clothes, ask about pain)
- Assign tasks (organize supplies, comfort others, fetch water)
- Monitor for deterioration (someone may collapse — they get re-triaged)

**Expected:** In 15 minutes, one triager can assess ~30 victims.

### 15-30 MINUTES — IMMEDIATE LIFE-SAVING INTERVENTIONS

**All RED tags get rapid interventions in priority order:**

**Priority 1: BLEEDING CONTROL**
- Arterial bleeding (spurting) → Tourniquet or direct pressure
- Venous bleeding (oozing) → Pressure bandage
- **Do NOT waste time on perfect bandaging** — stop the bleeding, move to next RED
- See [l1-medical-bleeding-control] for techniques

**Priority 2: AIRWAY MANAGEMENT**
- Position patient (recovery position if unconscious, sit up if breathing difficulty)
- Clear airway (suction, finger sweep if visible obstruction)
- **Do NOT attempt advanced airway** (intubation) unless specially trained and in stable RED

**Priority 3: SEAL CHEST WOUNDS**
- Sucking chest wound (air bubbling from chest) → Seal with plastic taped on 3 sides (allows air out, not in)
- See [l1-medical-chest-wounds]

**Priority 4: SHOCK MANAGEMENT**
- Lie flat, elevate legs (if no spinal injury)
- Keep warm (blankets, jackets)
- Nothing by mouth (NPO) — if they need surgery, full stomach = aspiration risk

**What you do NOT do during immediate phase:**
- Splint fractures (unless bone is out of skin and bleeding)
- IV fluids (unless trained paramedic with supplies)
- Detailed wound care (clean and bandage later)
- Comfort care for BLACK tags (harsh but necessary)

**Expected:** 15 minutes to stabilize 5-10 RED patients (2-3 minutes each for basic interventions).

### 30 MINUTES - 2 HOURS — DELAYED CARE & RE-TRIAGE

**Once all REDs are stabilized (or deceased):**

**Treatment shifts to YELLOW tags:**
- Splint fractures
- Clean and bandage wounds
- Pain management (if medications available)
- Fluids by mouth (if alert)

**Re-triage ALL victims:**
- **RED → Stable?** May be downgraded to YELLOW (free up resources)
- **YELLOW → Deteriorating?** Upgrade to RED (bleeding started, breathing worsened)
- **GREEN → New symptoms?** May upgrade to YELLOW (internal bleeding presenting late)
- **BLACK → Was this wrong?** Rare, but if you find signs of life, re-assess

**Re-triage interval:** Every 15-30 minutes in first 2 hours, then hourly

**Psychological First Aid begins:**
- Talk to conscious victims (reduces panic)
- Cover deceased (reduces trauma for others)
- Allow family contact if safe (morale, information gathering)

### 2+ HOURS — ONGOING CARE & EVACUATION

**If official help hasn't arrived, you're in prolonged field care.**

**Evacuation priority** (if ambulances arrive):
1. RED tags first (most critical)
2. YELLOW tags second
3. GREEN tags last (can walk to vehicles or wait)
4. BLACK tags remain (unless morgue transport available)

**If NO official help arriving:**
- Establish field hospital (move victims to shelter if weather/safety issue)
- Continue treatment with available supplies
- Send runners to get medical professionals from community
- Prepare for long-term care (see below)

**Maintain supplies:**
- Blood loss → Need for fluids (oral rehydration if conscious)
- Infection risk → Clean wounds, antibiotics if available
- Pain → Manage with available meds (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or improvised like willow bark tea)

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

**Minimum supplies for 10-victim mass casualty:**
- **Triage tags:** 20 (or markers + tape)
- **Tourniquets:** 5-10 (commercial or cloth strips)
- **Pressure bandages:** 20 (gauze, trauma pads, or t-shirts)
- **Gloves:** 20+ pairs (universal precaution)
- **Blankets:** 10 (shock/hypothermia)
- **Water:** 5 gallons (drinking, wound irrigation)
- **Pain meds:** Ibuprofen (50 doses), acetaminophen (50 doses)
- **Antibiotics:** Broad-spectrum if available (cephalexin, amoxicillin — 10 courses)
- **Splinting materials:** SAM splints, cardboard, sticks, cloth strips

**If preparing for potential mass casualty (disaster zone, conflict area):**
- Pre-position trauma kits at community centers
- Train 20% of population in START triage (so multiple triagers available)
- Establish rally point (where victims will be brought/triaged)
- Identify field hospital location (school gym, church, warehouse)

## GROUP DYNAMICS & ROLE ASSIGNMENT

**Ideal triage team:** 10-15 people for 20-30 victims

**Roles:**
- **Incident Commander (IC):** Oversees scene, assigns roles, requests resources
- **Triage Officer:** Tags victims only (does NOT treat)
- **Treatment Team Leader:** Coordinates RED tag interventions
- **Treatment Providers (3-5):** Tourniquets, bandaging, airways
- **YELLOW Team (2-3):** Treat delayed patients once REDs stable
- **GREEN Manager:** Organizes walking wounded, assigns helper tasks
- **Supply Runner:** Fetches equipment, communicates with outside
- **Psych First Aid:** Calms panicked, talks to conscious victims, shields from graphic sights
- **Documentation:** Tracks victims (names, injuries, triage category, treatments given)
- **Family Liaison:** Reunites families, answers questions, manages bystanders

**Rotation:** Every 1-2 hours, rotate high-stress roles (triager, treatment) to prevent burnout.

**Untrained helpers:**
- Assign to GREEN management (comfort, water, blankets)
- Runners (fetch supplies, no medical knowledge needed)
- Crowd control (keep bystanders back)
- **Do NOT assign to triage or RED treatment** (requires training)

## MENTAL HEALTH PROTOCOLS

### For RESPONDERS:

**Acute Stress (During Event):**
- **Dissociation/Numbing:** "This doesn't feel real" — NORMAL, allows you to function. Use it.
- **Hypervigilance:** Startling at sounds, scanning for threats — NORMAL in dangerous scene. Stay alert but don't freeze.
- **Intrusive thoughts:** Imagining worst outcomes — Push aside, focus on task at hand. Process later.

**Responder self-care:**
- [ ] Rotate out every 1-2 hours (fatigue → mistakes)
- [ ] Hydrate and eat (even if not hungry — you're burning energy)
- [ ] Brief rest (5-10 min away from scene if possible)
- [ ] Talk to teammate (vent frustration, "this is horrible" — acknowledge reality)

**Post-Event (First 24-72 Hours):**
- **Flashbacks, nightmares, anger, crying, numbness** — ALL NORMAL after mass trauma
- **Debrief:** Talk through event with team (what happened, what you saw, how you feel)
- **Peer support:** Check on each other, watch for isolation or substance use
- **Avoid judging yourself:** "I should have saved more" → Reframe: "I saved who I could with what I had"
- **Professional help:** If symptoms worsen after 1 week (can't sleep, can't function, suicidal thoughts) → Seek counselor/therapist

**Warning signs of responder crisis:**
- Cannot stop crying or cannot cry at all (emotional paralysis)
- Aggressive outbursts (yelling, hitting, throwing things)
- Reckless behavior (driving dangerously, substance abuse, self-harm)
- Complete withdrawal (won't talk, won't leave room, staring blankly)
- **Action:** Immediate intervention, 24/7 supervision, professional mental health care if available

### For VICTIMS (Conscious):

**During event:**
- **Simple reassurance:** "You're going to be okay. We're helping you. Stay with me."
- **Orient to reality:** "There was an explosion. You're injured. We're taking care of you."
- **Reduce sensory overwhelm:** Cover their eyes if graphic sights nearby, calm voice, gentle touch

**For YELLOW/GREEN tags (can communicate):**
- **Assign task:** "Can you hold pressure on this bandage?" — Gives sense of control
- **Connect them:** "What's your name? Do you have family here?" — Human connection combats shock
- **Normalize fear:** "It's okay to be scared. You're safe now."

**For RED tags (critical):**
- **Even if unconscious, talk to them:** "I'm helping you. You're not alone." (may still process voice)
- **Protect dignity:** Cover them appropriately, avoid discussing their prognosis within earshot

### For BYSTANDERS/FAMILY:

**Panic management:**
- **Screaming/running:** Firm voice, direct command: "STOP. Look at me. Breathe with me." (Box breathing — 4 in, 4 hold, 4 out)
- **Combative (trying to interfere):** "I know you want to help. The best way to help is [specific task: get blankets, move your car, sit with this person]."
- **Frozen in horror:** Physical touch (if safe — hand on shoulder), "I need you to help. Can you do that?" — Action breaks paralysis.

**Family wanting to see victim:**
- **If victim is RED/critical:** "They're getting emergency care right now. Let us stabilize them first, then you can see them." (Prevents family from seeing resuscitation — traumatizing)
- **If victim is BLACK:** Prepare them: "I'm very sorry. They didn't survive. Would you like to see them?" Escort, warn about appearance (blood, injuries), allow brief time.

**Children at scene:**
- **Remove from graphic sights if possible** (assign adult to take them to separate area)
- **Simple, honest explanation:** "There was an accident. People are hurt. Doctors are helping." (Don't lie, but age-appropriate)
- **Reunite with parent ASAP** (even injured parent if stable — seeing parent alive reduces trauma)

## COMMON FATAL MISTAKES

### 1. TREATING THE FIRST VICTIM YOU SEE (No Triage)
- **Mistake:** Spending 15 minutes on first victim (who might be YELLOW or even GREEN), while 5 RED victims bleed out 20 feet away
- **Result:** Easily saveable victims die (tourniquet takes 30 seconds — could have saved 5 people in that 15 min)
- **Avoid:** ALWAYS triage everyone FIRST. Tag, then treat. Treat in priority order (RED first).

### 2. ATTEMPTING CPR IN MASS CASUALTY
- **Mistake:** Starting CPR on non-breathing victim (requires 2 people, 15+ minutes, uncertain outcome)
- **Result:** 2 rescuers tied up, 10+ other victims not getting care, likely CPR victim still dies
- **Avoid:** In mass casualty, non-breathing victims are BLACK. This is brutal but mathematically necessary.

### 3. FAMILY MEMBER TRIAGE (Emotional Conflict)
- **Mistake:** Family member acts as triager, upgrades their loved one to RED when they're YELLOW, or can't tag them BLACK
- **Result:** Overtriage (wasted resources) or inability to make objective decisions
- **Avoid:** Family members should NOT triage their own. Assign them to support roles (comfort other victims, fetch supplies).

### 4. UNDERTRIAGE (Missed Life-Threatening Injuries)
- **Mistake:** Missing internal bleeding (victim looks fine, is even walking, but has liver laceration → deteriorates suddenly)
- **Result:** Preventable death from missed injury
- **Avoid:** RE-TRIAGE every 15-30 min. Question anyone who "looks too good" (shock delays pain). Ask about pain, check vitals if possible.

### 5. SCENE SAFETY IGNORED (Rescuer Becomes Victim)
- **Mistake:** Running into unstable building, not checking for active shooter, ignoring hazmat (chemical fumes, etc.)
- **Result:** Rescuer injured/killed, now you have +1 victim and -1 helper
- **Avoid:** Scene safety ALWAYS first. Dead rescuers save nobody. Wait for scene secured or use protective equipment.

### 6. NO INCIDENT COMMAND (Chaos)
- **Mistake:** Everyone doing their own thing, multiple people treating same victim while others are ignored, no coordination
- **Result:** Duplication of effort, missed victims, inefficiency
- **Avoid:** First trained person on scene = Incident Commander until relieved. Assign roles clearly. Communicate.

### 7. TREATING BLACK TAGS (Misplaced Compassion)
- **Mistake:** Spending time providing comfort care to dying/dead patient when RED patients need intervention
- **Result:** RED patient dies who could have been saved
- **Avoid:** In initial phase, BLACK tags get NO care (cover body, move on). Only after all RED/YELLOW stabilized can you provide comfort to dying. Harsh but necessary.

### 8. PSYCHOLOGICAL BREAKDOWN OF RESPONDERS (Unmanaged Stress)
- **Mistake:** Pushing through without breaks, ignoring emotional state, no rotation
- **Result:** Responder makes mistakes (wrong triage, missed injuries), has breakdown mid-event (now they need care), long-term PTSD
- **Avoid:** Rotate roles, mandate breaks, allow emotional release ("this is horrible" = valid), debrief after event.

### 9. DISORGANIZED EVACUATION (Wrong People Loaded First)
- **Mistake:** First ambulance takes GREEN tag (because they walked to ambulance), while RED tags wait
- **Result:** Critical patient dies waiting, non-critical patient takes up ambulance space
- **Avoid:** Ambulance loading is TRIAGE-BASED. RED → YELLOW → GREEN. Physically block GREEN tags from self-evacuating until critical patients go first.

### 10. NO DOCUMENTATION (Lost Victims)
- **Mistake:** No one tracking who was treated, what injuries, where they went
- **Result:** Lost patients, inability to reunite families, legal issues later, can't learn lessons for next time
- **Avoid:** Assign someone to document: Victim name/description, triage category, injuries noted, treatments given, evacuated where/when.

## DECISION MATRIX

```
TRIAGE DECISION FLOW:

Can walk? → YES → GREEN (minor)
             ↓ NO
Breathing? → NO → Open airway → Breathing now? → YES → RED (immediate)
                                                   ↓ NO → BLACK (dead)
             ↓ YES
Respiratory rate → >30/min → RED (immediate)
                   ↓ <30/min
Radial pulse → Weak/absent → RED (immediate)
               ↓ Present
Mental status → Follows commands → YELLOW (delayed)
                ↓ Does NOT follow → RED (immediate)
```

**See diagram:** `diagrams/start-triage-protocol.svg`

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Children (JumpSTART modification):
- Assess breathing, then pulse (like adult), BUT:
- **Respiratory rate:** >45 OR <15 breaths/min = RED (different normal ranges for kids)
- **Mental status:** "AVPU" scale (Alert, responds to Voice, responds to Pain, Unresponsive) — anything except Alert = RED

### Pregnant Women:
- Treat as RED if in late pregnancy with trauma (fetal distress likely, maternal physiology different)
- Lie on LEFT side (prevents compression of vena cava)

### Elderly with Pre-Existing Conditions:
- Lower threshold for RED (less physiologic reserve)
- May not show typical vital sign changes (heart rate stays low even in shock due to medications)

### Prolonged Field Care (No Evacuation Available):
- Upgrade BLACK to "Expectant" → These get comfort care only (pain control, companionship)
- Long-term care for YELLOW/GREEN (wound care, infection prevention)
- Establish field hospital with ongoing supplies

---

**FINAL NOTE:** Mass casualty triage is one of the hardest things you'll ever do. You will make decisions that haunt you. You will tag someone BLACK who might have lived in a hospital. This is the mathematics of disaster: save the most lives possible with limited resources.

**After it's over:** Debrief, grieve, support each other. You did the best anyone could. That has to be enough.

# Mass Casualty Triage — START System for Disaster Response

Mass casualty events (explosions, building collapse, mass shooting, natural disaster) overwhelm medical resources. Triage sorts victims by priority: who needs immediate care, who can wait, who is beyond help. START (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) is the standard system. Goal: save the most lives with limited resources.
