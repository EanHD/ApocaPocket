summary: 'Mass casualty events (explosions, building collapse, mass shooting, natural disaster) overwhelm medical resources. Triage sorts victims by priority: who needs immediate care, who can wait, who
  is beyond help. START (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) is the standard system. Goal: save the most lives with limited resources.'
warnings:
- Triage decisions are brutal - you may classify saveable people as dead to save others
- Requires emotional detachment - family members cannot triage their own loved ones
- Wrong triage kills people - undertriage (miss serious injuries) or overtriage (waste resources on minor injuries)
- START is for adults - JumpSTART system exists for children
steps:
- 'TRIAGE CATEGORIES: (1) GREEN (MINOR): Walking wounded. Minor injuries. Can wait hours for care. (2) YELLOW (DELAYED): Serious injuries but stable. Need care within hours. (3) RED (IMMEDIATE): Life-threatening
  injuries but saveable with rapid care. Priority for treatment. (4) BLACK (EXPECTANT/DEAD): Dead or injuries too severe to survive with available resources. Do not treat (brutal but necessary in mass casualty).'
- 'START TRIAGE PROCESS (30 seconds per victim): STEP 1 - WALKING: Yell ANYONE WHO CAN WALK, MOVE TO [location]. Anyone who walks is GREEN (minor). STEP 2 - BREATHING: Assess non-walkers. Is victim breathing?
  If NO: open airway (head tilt-chin lift). If starts breathing: RED (immediate). If does NOT breathe: BLACK (dead). If YES (breathing): proceed to step 3. STEP 3 - RESPIRATORY RATE: Count breaths for 15
  seconds. Under 30 per minute: proceed to step 4. Over 30 per minute: RED (immediate - respiratory distress). STEP 4 - CIRCULATION: Check radial pulse (wrist). Strong pulse: proceed to step 5. Weak or
  no radial pulse: RED (immediate - shock). STEP 5 - MENTAL STATUS: Can victim follow simple commands? (Squeeze my hand, stick out your tongue.) YES: YELLOW (delayed - serious injuries but stable). NO:
  RED (immediate - altered mental status indicates severe injury).'
- 'TAGGING: Mark triage category on victim (write on forehead with marker, attach colored ribbon, or use commercial triage tags). Prevents re-triaging same person.'
- 'TREATMENT PRIORITIES: (1) Treat all RED patients first (life-threatening but saveable). (2) When all RED patients are stabilized or resources exhausted, treat YELLOW. (3) Comfort BLACK patients but do
  not use medical resources. (4) GREEN patients self-care or help others. (5) RE-TRIAGE periodically (patients can deteriorate - YELLOW becomes RED).'
- 'SPECIFIC LIFE-SAVING INTERVENTIONS (for RED patients): (1) BLEEDING: Direct pressure, tourniquets (see entry). (2) AIRWAY: Open airway, clear obstructions, recovery position. (3) BREATHING: Rescue breaths
  if not breathing. Seal sucking chest wounds. (4) SHOCK: Lie flat, elevate legs, keep warm. Do not spend time on complicated procedures (IVs, splinting, wound care) until all RED patients addressed.'
- 'EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES: (1) Screaming victims get attention but may not be most critical. (2) Quiet victims may be dying (altered mental status, shock). (3) Children are heartbreaking but follow same triage
  rules. (4) Helpers need breaks and emotional support. Rotate triage officers. (5) Expect anger from families (why is my loved one BLACK?). Stay calm, explain triage logic.'
- 'WHEN TO RE-TRIAGE: (1) New resources arrive (more medical personnel, ambulances). (2) Situation stabilizes (all immediate threats treated). (3) BLACK patients may be re-evaluated if resources become
  available (but this is rare in true mass casualty).'

# Mass Casualty Triage — START System for Disaster Response

Mass casualty events (explosions, building collapse, mass shooting, natural disaster) overwhelm medical resources. Triage sorts victims by priority: who needs immediate care, who can wait, who is beyond help. START (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) is the standard system. Goal: save the most lives with limited resources.
