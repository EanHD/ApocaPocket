summary: Several wild plants contain compounds that reduce pain and inflammation. Not as effective as modern painkillers but can provide relief for headaches, muscle pain, minor injuries when pharmaceuticals
  are unavailable.
warnings:
- Plant-based pain relief is weak compared to modern analgesics
- Severe or worsening pain is a medical emergency - infection, internal injury, etc.
- Willow bark should not be given to children (Reye syndrome risk, same as aspirin)
- Long-term use of some herbs can cause side effects
steps:
- 'WILLOW BARK (Salix species): Contains salicin (converted to salicylic acid - aspirin). PREPARATION: Simmer 1-2 tsp chopped inner bark in 1 cup water for 10 min. Strain. Drink 1-2 cups per day. USES:
  Headache, muscle pain, inflammation, fever. EFFECTS: Mild to moderate pain relief after 1-2 hours. CAUTION: Same warnings as aspirin (stomach irritation, bleeding risk, not for children).'
- 'MEADOWSWEET: Similar to willow (contains salicylates). Tea from flowers/leaves. Milder on stomach than willow bark.'
- 'WHITE WILLOW TEA: Most commonly used willow species for pain. Widely distributed in temperate regions near water.'
- 'ARNICA (topical only): Flowers used as poultice for bruises, sprains, muscle pain. NEVER ingest (toxic). Crush fresh flowers, apply to skin (not open wounds). Reduces swelling and pain.'
- 'WILD LETTUCE: Latex (milky sap) has mild sedative and pain-relieving properties. Dry and smoke or make tea. Weak but non-toxic. Traditional use for insomnia and pain.'
- 'DOSAGE AND EFFECTS: Herbal pain relievers are weak. Expect 20-40 percent pain reduction, not complete relief. Takes 1-2 hours to work. Best for chronic low-level pain (headaches, arthritis) not acute
  severe pain.'
