summary: 'Pandemic response prioritizes: (1) Avoiding infection (isolation, hygiene, PPE). (2) Caring for sick while protecting caregivers. (3) Maintaining essential services. Based on CDC and WHO pandemic
  preparedness guidelines. Lessons from COVID-19, influenza, and historical pandemics.'
warnings:
- Pandemics can overwhelm medical systems - most care will be home-based
- Social breakdown can occur (supply chain disruption, civil unrest, violence)
- Misinformation spreads during pandemics - rely on established public health guidance
- Protecting caregivers is essential - if caregivers get sick, everyone suffers
steps:
- 'ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE: ISOLATION - separate sick people from healthy. QUARANTINE - separate exposed people (not yet sick) for incubation period. Set up designated sick room in home if possible. Sick
  person stays in room, uses separate bathroom if possible, wears mask when around others. Caregivers use PPE (see below). Quarantine exposed individuals for 14 days (typical incubation for most respiratory
  viruses).'
- 'PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE): (1) MASK: N95 or equivalent (filters 95 percent of particles). Cloth masks provide some protection (better than nothing). (2) EYE PROTECTION: Goggles or face shield
  (viruses enter through eyes). (3) GLOVES: Disposable or washable. Change after contact with sick person. (4) GOWN/APRON: Cover clothing. Remove before leaving sick room. (5) HAND HYGIENE: Wash hands 20+
  seconds with soap after every contact. Alcohol-based sanitizer (60 percent+ alcohol) if soap unavailable.'
- 'HOME CARE FOR SICK: (1) REST and FLUIDS. (2) Fever management (cooling measures, fluids). (3) Monitor breathing (respiratory distress requires urgent care if available). (4) Isolate waste (bag all used
  tissues, masks, gloves - dispose carefully or burn if possible). (5) Disinfect surfaces (bleach solution - 1 part bleach to 9 parts water). (6) Separate dishes/utensils or wash thoroughly with hot soapy
  water.'
- 'COMMUNITY RESPONSE: (1) Limit gatherings (social distancing reduces transmission). (2) Establish community health monitors (track cases, identify outbreaks). (3) Set up communal sick care if many are
  ill (dedicate building, trained volunteers in PPE). (4) Protect essential workers (food production, water, sanitation - these people get priority for PPE and vaccination if available). (5) Plan for supply
  disruption (stockpile food, water, fuel, medicine).'
- 'DIY PPE (when commercial unavailable): (1) Cloth masks from tightly-woven fabric (multiple layers). (2) Eye protection from clear plastic sheets. (3) Gowns from plastic bags or trash bags (cut arm holes).
  (4) Hand sanitizer from rubbing alcohol and aloe gel (mix 2parts alcohol to 1part aloe). Not as good as commercial PPE but better than nothing.'
- 'MENTAL HEALTH: Pandemics cause fear, isolation, grief (many deaths). Maintain communication (radio, messengers). Support grieving families. Establish routines. Provide accurate information to reduce
  panic.'
