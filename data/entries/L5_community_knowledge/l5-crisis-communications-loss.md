summary: 'Grid-down or disaster scenarios eliminate phones, internet, and radio infrastructure. Communication methods: foot/bike messengers, visual signals, sound signals, ham radio (if equipment survives).
  Establishing communication networks is critical for survival coordination.'
warnings:
- Messengers are vulnerable to ambush, capture, accidents
- Radio transmissions can be intercepted by hostiles
- Visual/sound signals are limited range and require line of sight
- Miscommunication kills - establish clear protocols
steps:
- 'MESSENGER SYSTEM: FOOT/BIKE RUNNERS: Fastest method for local communication (under 20 miles). SELECT: Young, fit, trustworthy individuals. Memorize messages (written messages can be captured and read).
  PAIRS: Send two runners (if one is injured/captured, other continues). ROUTES: Scouts identify safe routes between locations. Change routes periodically (avoid ambush). TIMING: Establish expected arrival
  times (if runner is late, assume captured or ambushed). AUTHENTICATION: Runners carry token or password to prove identity (prevents infiltration).'
- 'VISUAL SIGNALS: (1) SMOKE: Daytime signal. Black smoke (burn rubber, oil) or white smoke (wet green material). Number of puffs = code (1 puff = all clear, 2 puffs = danger, 3 puffs = attack). Range:
  5-10 miles in clear weather. (2) FIRE: Nighttime signal. Large bonfire visible for miles. (3) MIRRORS: Reflect sunlight (signal mirror or improvised from glass). Flash code (Morse or agreed-upon pattern).
  Range: 10+ miles. (4) FLAGS: Daytime signal. Color-coded flags (red = danger, white = all clear, etc.). Raised on poles. Range: line of sight (1-3 miles). (5) LIGHTS: Nighttime. Flashlight flashes (Morse
  code). Range: 1-5 miles depending on terrain.'
- 'SOUND SIGNALS: (1) BELLS/GONGS: Loud, carries far. Number of strikes = code. Range: 1-3 miles. (2) GUNSHOTS: Loud but wastes ammunition. Pattern of shots (1-2-3) = specific meaning. Range: 5+ miles.
  (3) WHISTLES: Personal signaling (guard alerting others). Range: 1/2 mile. (4) DRUMS: Rhythmic patterns carry far. Traditional communication in many cultures. Range: 3-5 miles. (5) HORNS/SIRENS: Very
  loud if you have functional device. Air horn, vehicle horn, etc.'
- 'HAM RADIO: If equipment survives EMP or you have shielded devices: (1) LICENSE: Not required in emergency but operation requires technical knowledge. (2) EQUIPMENT: Transceiver, antenna, power (battery,
  solar, generator). (3) FREQUENCY: Monitor emergency frequencies (146.52 MHz common VHF simplex). (4) RANGE: VHF/UHF line of sight (10-50 miles). HF long-distance (hundreds to thousands of miles with right
  conditions). (5) SECURITY: Radio is NOT secure. Anyone with receiver can hear. Use code words or pre-arranged meanings. (6) OPERATORS: Ham radio operators are valuable resource in disaster (experienced
  communicators).'
- 'ESTABLISHING COMM NETWORK: (1) DESIGNATE COMM HUB (central location receives and relays messages). (2) SCHEDULED CHECK-INS: Outlying posts report to hub at set times daily (morning and evening). If post
  misses check-in, send runner to investigate. (3) MESSAGE PRIORITY: Emergency (immediate - attack, fire, injury), Routine (can wait hours - supply request, info). (4) REDUNDANCY: Use multiple methods (runner
  + signal) for critical messages. (5) LOGS: Keep written record of all messages sent/received (tracks info, identifies patterns).'
- 'CODES AND ENCRYPTION: (1) BREVITY CODES: Numbers = pre-arranged meanings (Code 1 = all clear, Code 2 = minor incident, Code 3 = attack). Fast and reduces transmission time. (2) SUBSTITUTION: Replace
  sensitive words (do not say food, say winter supplies). (3) ONE-TIME PADS: Advanced encryption if you have training and materials (secure but complex). (4) AUTHENTICATION: Include code word in every message
  to verify sender (prevents false messages from enemies).'

# Communications Without Infrastructure — Runners, Signals, Radio

Grid-down or disaster scenarios eliminate phones, internet, and radio infrastructure. Communication methods: foot/bike messengers, visual signals, sound signals, ham radio (if equipment survives). Establishing communication networks is critical for survival coordination.
