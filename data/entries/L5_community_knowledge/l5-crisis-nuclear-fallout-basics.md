summary: 'Nuclear detonation produces blast, heat, EMP, and fallout (radioactive particles that rain down for hours to days). Immediate survival: shelter in place for 24-72 hours in a thick-walled structure.
  Minimize radiation exposure. Based on CDC and FEMA nuclear emergency guidelines.'
warnings:
- Nuclear war would cause civilization collapse - this entry covers IMMEDIATE survival only
- Radiation sickness is dose-dependent - no amount is safe but time/distance/shielding reduce exposure
- Fallout is most dangerous in first 24-48 hours (decays exponentially)
- Iodine pills (KI) only protect thyroid from radioiodine - not a general radiation cure
steps:
- 'IMMEDIATE ACTION (within 10 minutes of detonation): (1) GET INSIDE immediately. Any building is better than outside. (2) GO TO BASEMENT or center of building (farthest from outside walls/roof). (3) CLOSE
  DOORS AND WINDOWS. Turn off ventilation (prevents fallout particles entering). (4) REMOVE OUTER CLOTHING (fallout particles on clothing). Place in plastic bag, seal, move away from living area. (5) SHOWER
  if possible (washes off fallout particles) - do not scrub hard (damages skin), use lukewarm water, shampoo hair. (6) STAY INSIDE for at least 24 hours (preferably 48-72 hours). Radiation decays rapidly
  - after 48 hours, radiation is 1 percent of initial level.'
- 'SHELTER SELECTION: BEST: Basement of large multi-story concrete building (thick walls and floors above provide shielding). GOOD: Center rooms of single-story concrete/brick building. Interior rooms (bathrooms,
  closets). POOR: Wood-frame house (some protection, better than nothing). WORST: Vehicles, tents, outside. SHIELDING PRINCIPLE: Dense material blocks radiation. Earth, concrete, water, lead. More mass
  between you and fallout = less radiation exposure.'
- 'IMPROVISED SHIELDING: If shelter is inadequate, improve it: (1) Pile dense objects around shelter area (books, furniture, water containers, bags of dirt/sand). (2) Stay in center of shelter (farthest
  from walls/roof). (3) Seal windows and vents with plastic sheeting and tape (reduces fallout entry).'
- 'SUPPLIES: (1) WATER: Store as much as possible before fallout arrives (fill every container - bathtubs, sinks, bottles). Municipal water may become contaminated. (2) FOOD: Sealed food is safe (canned,
  boxed). Wash outer packaging. Do not eat fresh food exposed to fallout. (3) RADIO: Battery-powered or hand-crank. Listen for official instructions. (4) Sanitation: Plastic bags for waste (cannot go outside
  to use bathroom).'
- 'WHEN TO LEAVE SHELTER: (1) Official all-clear (radio broadcast). (2) After 48-72 hours if no information (radiation has decayed significantly). (3) Life-threatening emergency (fire, structural collapse,
  medical emergency). IF YOU MUST GO OUTSIDE: (1) Cover all skin (long sleeves, pants, gloves, mask or cloth over mouth/nose, hat). (2) Move quickly. (3) Return to shelter, remove all clothing outside,
  shower.'
- 'RADIATION SICKNESS SYMPTOMS: MILD (1-2 Sv dose): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea within hours. Recovery in weeks. MODERATE (2-6 Sv): Severe nausea, hair loss, bleeding, infections. Possible death without
  medical care. LETHAL (over 6 Sv): Rapid onset symptoms, internal bleeding, organ failure. Death within days to weeks. NO FIELD TREATMENT exists. Minimize exposure is only prevention.'
- 'DECONTAMINATION: (1) Remove clothing (removes 90 percent of fallout contamination). (2) Gentle shower with soap. (3) Wash hair (do not use conditioner - binds particles). (4) Blow nose, wipe eyelids
  and ears with damp cloth. (5) Put on clean clothes from inside shelter. (6) Contaminated items: bag and seal, move away from living area. Do not handle unnecessarily.'
- 'LONG-TERM (after initial fallout): (1) Avoid contaminated areas (government will map hotspots). (2) Decontaminate property (wash surfaces, remove topsoil). (3) Monitor food and water (government tests
  for contamination). (4) Evacuate if instructed. (5) Medical screening (check for radiation exposure, cancer risk). Recovery will take years to decades.'

# Nuclear Fallout Survival — Shelter, Decontamination, Radiation Sickness

Nuclear detonation produces blast, heat, EMP, and fallout (radioactive particles that rain down for hours to days). Immediate survival: shelter in place for 24-72 hours in a thick-walled structure. Minimize radiation exposure. Based on CDC and FEMA nuclear emergency guidelines.
