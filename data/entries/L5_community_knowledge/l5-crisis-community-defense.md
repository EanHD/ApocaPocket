summary: 'Long-term survival in lawless conditions requires organized defense. Small groups (under 10 people) use concealment and evasion. Larger communities (50+ people) can defend territory. Priorities:
  early warning, hardened perimeter, armed guards, discipline. Based on military small-unit tactics.'
warnings:
- Armed defense attracts attention - may invite attack from better-armed groups
- Killing in self-defense has psychological consequences - expect trauma
- Defending a location ties you to that location (cannot easily retreat)
- Internal conflict over resources and authority is common - establish clear rules early
steps:
- 'DEFENSE STRATEGY BY GROUP SIZE: SMALL (2-10 people): AVOID CONFLICT. Stay hidden. Scatter if attacked. Fight only if cornered. MEDIUM (10-30 people): DEFEND TEMPORARY CAMPS. Hardened position, armed
  watch, but ready to retreat if overmatched. LARGE (50+ people): DEFEND TERRITORY. Establish perimeter, multiple guard posts, fortifications. Can repel small attacks but still vulnerable to large organized
  groups or government forces.'
- 'PERIMETER SECURITY: (1) CLEAR FIELDS OF FIRE: Remove vegetation, obstacles in 100m zone around perimeter (attackers have no cover). (2) BARRIERS: Fences (barbed wire, chain-link), walls (stacked materials,
  earth berms), trenches, abatis (sharpened stakes). Goal: slow attackers, funnel them into kill zones. (3) MULTIPLE LAYERS: Outer perimeter (early warning), inner perimeter (hardened defense), safe zone
  (civilians, supplies).'
- 'GUARD POSTS: (1) ELEVATED: Height provides visibility and defensive advantage. Use buildings, towers, or platforms. (2) COVERED: Sandbags, walls, or natural cover protect guards from fire. (3) COMMUNICATION:
  Guards need way to alert others (radio, whistle, bell, runner). (4) OVERLAPPING FIELDS OF FIRE: Multiple guard posts can cover same area (no blind spots). (5) ROTATION: 4-hour shifts max (longer = fatigue,
  mistakes). Rotate guards through posts.'
- 'WATCH SCHEDULE: (1) 24/7 COVERAGE: Always have guards on duty (attacks often come at night or dawn). (2) SHIFT HANDOFF: Outgoing guard briefs incoming (what happened, anything unusual, sector status).
  (3) REST: Guards need 8+ hours rest between shifts. Sleep deprivation kills alertness.'
- 'EARLY WARNING: (1) SENTRIES: Place guards on roads/trails leading to community (500m+ out). They report approaching threats and fall back to main perimeter. (2) ALARMS: Trip wires with bells/cans, dogs
  (bark at strangers), motion sensors (if power available). (3) PATROLS: Send armed patrols to scout surrounding area (daily or when threat increases). Do not send less than 3 people (safety in numbers).'
- 'RESPONSE TO ATTACK: (1) SOUND ALARM (all guards and armed defenders respond). (2) CIVILIANS TO SAFE ZONE (pre-designated shelter - basement, center of compound). (3) DEFENDERS TO POSITIONS (pre-assigned
  sectors - everyone knows their role). (4) ENGAGE ATTACKERS: Defenders fire from cover. Aim for center mass. Conserve ammunition (do not spray and pray). (5) RETREAT IF OVERMATCHED: If attackers break
  perimeter or have overwhelming firepower, sound retreat signal. Everyone falls back to rally point (pre-designated location outside community). Do not stand and die defending supplies.'
- 'DEFENSE DISCIPLINE: (1) RULES OF ENGAGEMENT: When do guards shoot? (Warning first? Shoot on sight?) Clear rules prevent accidents and hesitation. (2) AMMUNITION CONTROL: Centrally stored, distributed
  per shift. Prevents waste and theft. (3) FIRE DISCIPLINE: Shoot only on command or clear threat. Random shots alert enemies and waste ammo. (4) ACCOUNTABILITY: Guards who sleep on duty or abandon post
  endanger everyone (severe punishment necessary). (5) TRAINING: Regular drills (alarm response, defensive positions, retreat). Practice makes perfect.'
- 'AVOIDING SIEGE: Defenders have advantage in short engagements but lose in prolonged siege (attackers can wait, starve you out). Strategies: (1) STOCKPILE: Months of food, water, ammo. (2) NEGOTIATE:
  Offer tribute (pay off attackers) or alliance (join larger group). (3) PREEMPTIVE RETREAT: If overwhelmed force approaches, evacuate before siege begins. Territory is not worth dying for.'

# Community Defense & Perimeter Security

Long-term survival in lawless conditions requires organized defense. Small groups (under 10 people) use concealment and evasion. Larger communities (50+ people) can defend territory. Priorities: early warning, hardened perimeter, armed guards, discipline. Based on military small-unit tactics.
