summary: 'Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear detonation or solar storm can disable electronics and power grid over large areas. Grid-down from other causes (cyberattack, physical damage, fuel shortage)
  has similar effects. Priorities: water, food, security, communication without modern infrastructure. Most people are 72 hours from chaos without electricity.'
warnings:
- EMP effects are debated and unpredictable - some electronics may survive, others fail randomly
- Long-term grid failure (months to years) would be catastrophic - 90% of population unprepared
- Societal breakdown likely within 1-3 weeks (food/water scarcity, no medical care, violence escalation)
- False alarms and panic can be as dangerous as actual event - verify before acting
- Rural areas fare better than cities (less dependence on infrastructure, more resources)
- Most deaths are indirect (medical device failure, violence, starvation) not from the event itself

# EMP & Grid-Down Scenarios — Electronics Failure & Recovery

Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear detonation or solar storm can disable electronics and power grid over large areas. Grid-down from other causes (cyberattack, physical damage, fuel shortage) has similar effects. The modern world runs on electricity — when it stops, civilization has 72 hours before chaos begins.

## RECOGNITION SIGNS

### Nuclear EMP:
- **Bright flash on horizon** (nuclear detonation at high altitude, 25-300 miles up)
- **Instant electronics failure** (cars stop, phones dead, lights out)
- **No explosion heard** (detonation is in space or very high atmosphere)
- **Widespread effect** (potentially continent-wide from single detonation)
- **Likely preceded by escalating tensions** (geopolitical crisis, war threats)

### Solar Storm (Carrington Event):
- **Aurora borealis visible at unusual latitudes** (northern lights seen in tropics = major storm)
- **Gradual grid failure** (power flickers, then cascading blackouts)
- **Warning period** (hours to days of advance notice from space weather monitoring)
- **Global effect** (affects entire daylight side of Earth)
- **Recovery possible** (damaged transformers can be replaced, not total electronics loss)

### Cyberattack / Physical Grid Damage:
- **Regional/cascading blackouts** (one area fails, then spreads)
- **Some electronics still work** (phones function, cars drive, but no power)
- **Potential restoration** (if infrastructure intact, power can return in days/weeks)
- **Targeted nature** (specific regions or utilities affected)

### Grid Collapse from Infrastructure Decay:
- **Gradual failures** (brownouts become blackouts)
- **Hot weather trigger** (air conditioning load exceeds capacity)
- **Aging infrastructure** (transformers failing, no replacements available)
- **Economic crisis** (utilities can't afford maintenance)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (FIRST HOUR)

### Recognition & Assessment (First 5 Minutes):
- [ ] **STOP and assess:** What failed? (lights, phone, car, everything?)
- [ ] **Look around:** Are neighbors affected? (local issue vs widespread)
- [ ] **Listen:** Try battery-powered AM/FM radio (EMP may spare some, and broadcast stations have generators)
- [ ] **Check vehicles:** Does your car start? (Modern cars vulnerable, pre-1980s more likely to work)
- [ ] **Smell:** Any smoke/fire? (electrical fires possible from surge)

### Immediate Security (Minutes 5-15):
- [ ] **STAY HOME** - Do NOT get in car and drive (even if car works)
  - Roads will be chaos within minutes (disabled cars, crashes, panic)
  - Getting trapped away from home in first hours = major vulnerability
  - Exception: If you're at work and home is < 30 min walk, consider going NOW before chaos peaks
- [ ] **Lock all doors/windows** immediately
- [ ] **Arm yourself** (firearms, knives, improvised weapons)
- [ ] **Close curtains/blinds** (don't advertise lights or supplies)

### Water Priority (Minutes 15-60):
- [ ] **FILL EVERY CONTAINER NOW** while municipal pressure lasts:
  - Bathtubs (100+ gallons)
  - Sinks
  - Pots, pitchers, bottles, buckets
  - Washing machine (clean)
  - Any waterproof container
- **This is THE most critical first-hour action** — city water stops when pumps fail (hours) or elevated tanks empty (6-24 hours)

### Inventory & Planning (Remaining Hour):
- [ ] **Food:** Count days of food (assume 3 meals/day per person)
- [ ] **Water:** How many gallons collected? (1 gal/person/day minimum)
- [ ] **Medicine:** Critical medications (insulin, heart meds, etc.) — how many days?
- [ ] **Fuel:** Gasoline in cars/cans, propane tanks, wood for heating/cooking
- [ ] **Weapons:** Firearms, ammo count, melee weapons
- [ ] **Tools:** Hand tools (no power tools work), manual can opener, etc.
- [ ] **Light:** Flashlights, batteries, candles, lighters
- [ ] **Communication:** Battery radio, walkie-talkies, ham radio (if operator)

## TIMELINE-BASED PLANNING

### FIRST 24 HOURS — Lockdown & Assessment

**Primary Goals:** Secure resources, assess scope, establish security.

**Water:**
- After initial fill, identify ongoing sources:
  - Well (manual pump or bucket drop)
  - Stream/river (purify before drinking)
  - Rain collection (set up tarps/gutters to barrels)
  - Pool/hot tub (non-potable, use for washing/toilets)

**Food:**
- **Eat perishables FIRST** (refrigerator food spoils in 4-8 hours without power)
- Ration shelf-stable foods (assume weeks to months)
- **Do NOT go to stores** on Day 1 (violence, looting, mob chaos)

**Security:**
- **Establish watch rotation** (if multiple people)
- Reinforce entry points (bar doors, move furniture to block windows from inside)
- **Prepare for violence** (desperate people will act within 48-72 hours)
- **Stay quiet and dark** (no generator noise, no bright lights = don't attract attention)

**Communication:**
- Try radio (AM/FM, shortwave, ham) — emergency broadcasts may be running on generators
- Connect with immediate neighbors (yell from windows/doors, don't venture out yet)
- Establish signals (knock patterns, flashlight codes for "all clear" vs "threat")

**Mental Health:**
- **Family briefing:** Explain situation honestly (age-appropriate for kids)
- **Assign roles:** Everyone has a job (reduces panic)
- **Set expectations:** "We're staying inside for at least 3 days. Here's the plan."
- **Allow fear:** Acknowledge this is scary, then focus on actions

### DAYS 2-7 — Short-Term Survival

**Primary Goals:** Sustainable water, neighborhood alliance, intelligence gathering.

**Water Management:**
- Purify all drinking water (boil 10+ min, or bleach: 8 drops per gallon, wait 30 min)
- Establish collection system (rain barrels if rain, daily trips to stream/well if needed)
- Sanitation: Dig latrine 200+ feet from water source, or use bucket toilet (bag waste for burial)

**Food:**
- Continue rationing (½ to ⅔ normal portions)
- If safe, forage locally (gardens, parks, wild edibles you KNOW)
- Set traps/snares if skilled (passive food acquisition)
- **Do NOT hunt conspicuously** (gunshots attract attention and competition)

**Security Escalation:**
- **Violence peaks Days 3-7** (when desperation sets in)
- 24/7 watch (someone awake always)
- Perimeter awareness (know your exits, sightlines, choke points)
- **Group defense:** By Day 3-5, connect with trusted neighbors for mutual protection (1 house alone = vulnerable, 3-5 houses together = defensible)

**Intelligence Gathering:**
- **Scout during day** (armed, paired, stay within visual range of home)
- What's happening? (fires, looting, violence, organized groups forming?)
- Where are resources? (streams, unlooted stores, community forming?)
- Where are threats? (gangs, desperate mobs, fires spreading?)
- **Stay mobile and quiet** (bicycle > walking > car if car works)

**Communication Networks:**
- **Neighborhood meeting** (if safe, gather trusted neighbors)
- Establish messenger system (runners between houses/blocks)
- Ham radio operators become critical (long-distance intel)
- **Information is survival** (knowing what's coming = time to prepare)

**Medical:**
- Treat injuries immediately (infection kills without antibiotics)
- Ration medications (stretch supply as long as possible)
- Improvise (willow bark for pain, honey for wounds)
- **Expect casualties:** Without hospitals, injuries/illness may be fatal

### WEEKS 2-4 — Community Organization

**Primary Goals:** Formalize security, establish trade, begin agriculture.

**Community Structure:**
- **Block/neighborhood level** (10-50 houses)
- Designate roles:
  - Security (armed watch, patrols)
  - Food (coordinating gardens, foraging, hunting)
  - Water (maintaining shared sources)
  - Medical (best-trained person treats injuries)
  - Communications (radio operator, messengers)
- **Decision-making:** Elect temporary leadership or council

**Resource Pooling & Trade:**
- Skills inventory (who knows what: carpentry, farming, medical, mechanics)
- Resource sharing (you have seeds, neighbor has tools = partnership)
- Barter economy (no money, trade goods/services)
- **Protect essential workers** (farmer gets priority security, medic gets extra food)

**Agriculture:**
- **PLANT NOW** (even if season is poor, you need food in 60-90 days)
- Raid garden centers for seeds (if any left)
- Break up lawns (every square foot = potential food)
- Composting (waste → soil fertility)
- Small animals (chickens, rabbits — faster than large livestock)

**Energy/Heating:**
- Wood gathering (deadfall first, then cutting live trees)
- Rocket stoves (efficient wood burning)
- Solar charging (if panels survived)
- Bicycle generators (pedal power for small electronics)
- **Expect cold winters to be deadly** (start gathering wood in spring/summer)

**Mental Health:**
- **Grief & trauma:** Many deaths by Week 2-4 (violence, medical, suicide)
- Support systems (check-ins, share stories, cry together)
- Maintain humanity (music, games, celebration of small wins)
- **Children:** Keep routines, provide education, protect from worst sights

### MONTHS 2-6 — Stabilization

**Primary Goals:** Expand networks, harvest food, refine governance.

**Expanded Networks:**
- Connect with other neighborhoods (form town/regional councils)
- Trade caravans (armed escorts for goods exchange between communities)
- Refugee management (people fleeing cities arrive, starving — accept or turn away?)
- **Boundary definition:** "Our territory" needs to be clear (prevents conflicts)

**Food Security:**
- First harvests coming in (or failing — adapt)
- Hunting/fishing at scale (organize parties, share catches)
- Preservation (smoking, salting, drying, root cellaring)
- **Starvation period:** Months 4-6 are critical (initial supplies gone, first gardens maybe failed)

**Infrastructure:**
- Water: Wells, hand pumps, aqueducts, rainwater systems
- Power: Micro-hydro, windmills, more solar
- Sanitation: Communal latrines, waste management systems
- Transportation: Roads cleared, bridges repaired, bicycles prioritized

**Governance:**
- Laws (theft = what punishment? Murder? Rationing violations?)
- Conflict resolution (mediation, courts, or warlord justice?)
- **Justice tension:** Harsh punishment maintains order but erodes humanity. Balance needed.
- Taxation (% of harvest, labor requirements for public works)

### YEAR 1+ — Rebuilding Civilization

**Primary Goals:** Economic diversity, education systems, cultural preservation.

**Economy:**
- Currency (something backs money: grain, bullets, labor hours)
- Specialization (blacksmiths, brewers, doctors — not everyone farms)
- Surplus (producing more than needed = wealth, trade)

**Technology:**
- Low-tech manufacturing (blacksmithing, weaving, pottery)
- Salvage (strip cities for metals, tools, books)
- Knowledge preservation (libraries = sacred, elders = repositories)

**Culture & Hope:**
- Schools (reading, writing, math, skills)
- Arts (music, stories, festivals — humanity beyond survival)
- **Future vision:** "We will rebuild. This is not forever."

## COMMON FATAL MISTAKES

### 1. GOING TO THE STORE (Day 1-3)
- **Mistake:** Driving to supermarket for supplies when grid goes down
- **Result:** Trapped in mob, looting, violence, car stranded, killed for supplies
- **Avoid:** STAY HOME first 72 hours. Stores will be stripped/violent within hours.

### 2. NOT FILLING WATER IMMEDIATELY
- **Mistake:** "I'll fill water later, let me check what's happening first"
- **Result:** Pressure fails, you have no water stored, now dependent on unsafe sources
- **Avoid:** FILL WATER IS THE FIRST ACTION. Everything else can wait 30 minutes.

### 3. ASSUMING IT'S TEMPORARY (Normalcy Bias)
- **Mistake:** "Power will be back tomorrow, I'll just wait it out"
- **Result:** Unprepared when Day 3-7 hits and desperation peaks
- **Avoid:** Assume worst case (months), prepare accordingly. If it's shorter, great.

### 4. ISOLATING FROM NEIGHBORS (Lone Wolf)
- **Mistake:** "I'll defend my house alone, don't need anyone"
- **Result:** Overwhelmed by groups, can't sleep (no watch relief), killed when you doze
- **Avoid:** Form alliances with 2-5 trusted neighbors by Day 3-5. Numbers = survival.

### 5. CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION (Target)
- **Mistake:** Running generator loudly, lights blazing at night, cooking smells everywhere
- **Result:** "That house has power/food" = you're raided
- **Avoid:** Stay dark, quiet, unremarkable. Grey man principle.

### 6. NOT RATIONING FOOD (Eating Normally)
- **Mistake:** Eating 3 full meals/day initially because "we have food"
- **Result:** Supplies gone in 2 weeks, now starving with months to go
- **Avoid:** Ration immediately (½ to ⅔ portions), assume scarcity lasts months.

### 7. IGNORING SANITATION (Disease Outbreak)
- **Mistake:** No latrine system, waste piling up, contaminated water source
- **Result:** Dysentery, cholera, typhoid — kills more than violence
- **Avoid:** Sanitation = survival. Latrine away from water, burn/bury waste, wash hands.

### 8. MEDICATION DEPENDENCE (No Plan)
- **Mistake:** Diabetic with 30-day insulin supply, no plan for when it runs out
- **Result:** Diabetic coma and death within weeks
- **Avoid:** Critical med users need 6+ month supply or transition plan (diet change, herbal alternatives). This is harsh reality of grid-down.

### 9. VIOLENT OVERREACTION (Shooting First)
- **Mistake:** Shooting at anyone approaching property without assessment
- **Result:** Kill potential allies, make enemies, become target for retaliation
- **Avoid:** Graduated response (warn, show force, shoot if necessary). Reputation matters.

### 10. LOSING HOPE (Psychological Collapse)
- **Mistake:** "We're all going to die, why try?"
- **Result:** Suicide, reckless behavior, giving up on survival tasks
- **Avoid:** Small goals, daily wins, community support, future focus. Humans survived millennia without electricity.

## RESOURCE ASSESSMENT MATRIX

### What You NEED (Priority Order):

**Tier 1 — Immediate (Days 1-7):**
- Water (1 gal/person/day minimum)
- Security (weapons, locks, group alliance)
- Food (existing supplies, rationed)
- Shelter (warmth if cold, cooling if hot)
- Basic medicine (antibiotics, pain relief, first aid)

**Tier 2 — Short-term (Weeks 1-4):**
- Water purification (filters, bleach, boiling setup)
- Sustainable food (gardens started, trapping, foraging)
- Community organization (roles, leadership, cooperation)
- Sanitation (latrine, waste management)
- Communication (radio, messengers)

**Tier 3 — Medium-term (Months 1-6):**
- Agriculture at scale (multiple gardens, animal husbandry)
- Trade networks (connect with other communities)
- Energy alternatives (wood, solar, wind)
- Manufacturing (smithing, carpentry, textiles)
- Education (preserve knowledge, teach next generation)

**Tier 4 — Long-term (Year 1+):**
- Economic systems (currency, specialization, surplus)
- Governance (laws, justice, infrastructure)
- Cultural preservation (books, arts, history)
- Technology advancement (rebuilding industrial capacity slowly)
- Hope and vision (defining what civilization you're building)

### What You HAVE (Inventory Checklist):

**Immediately:**
- [ ] Food (days counted)
- [ ] Water (gallons stored + source identified)
- [ ] Weapons & ammo (count rounds)
- [ ] Medicine (list critical meds, doses remaining)
- [ ] Fuel (gallons gas, propane tanks, wood)

- [ ] Warm clothing/blankets
- [ ] Books (survival, medical, agriculture)
- [ ] Skills (inventory what you/neighbors know)

## MENTAL HEALTH PROTOCOLS

**Acute Stress (First 72 Hours):**
- **Shock/Denial:** "This can't last" → Action plan (even if uncertain) combats paralysis
- **Panic:** Box breathing, assign task, focus on controllables
- **Aggression:** Channel into productive work (fortification, gathering)

**Ongoing (Weeks-Months):**
- **Grief:** Mass death expected (violence, medical, starvation) — allow mourning, then move forward
- **Trauma:** Witnessing/committing violence to survive — talk about it, don't isolate
- **Despair:** Small wins, community support, future vision
- **Children:** Protect from worst sights, maintain routines, provide education/play

**Suicidal Crisis:**
- Remove means (lock up guns), 24/7 watch, intensive support, assign purpose/role
- "You matter to us. We need you. Hold on."

## DECISION MATRIX: Stay or Go?

**STAY if:**
- Urban/suburban with defensible home
- Water source nearby (well, stream, rain collection possible)
- Trusted neighbors to ally with
- Food stores + ability to garden
- **Default choice for most**

**GO if:**
- High-rise apartment (no water, indefensible)
- Inner city with no resources (concrete, no water, high violence)
- Destination in mind (rural retreat, family property with resources)
- Can reach destination safely (< 1 day walk, avoid highways)
- **GO in first 24 hours or wait months** (Days 2-30 = most dangerous travel period)

**NEVER go if:**
- No clear destination
- Hope of "finding something better"
- Highways (death traps — stranded cars, ambushes, mobs)

## LONG-TERM SURVIVAL SKILLS PRIORITY

1. **Water sourcing & purification**
2. **Gardening/agriculture**
3. **Food preservation (smoking, drying, salting)**
4. **Hunting/trapping**
5. **First aid/herbal medicine**
6. **Carpentry/building**
7. **Blacksmithing/metal work**
8. **Sewing/textiles**
9. **Leadership/conflict resolution**
10. **Teaching/knowledge preservation**
