summary: 'Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear detonation or solar storm can disable electronics and power grid over large areas. Grid-down from other causes (cyberattack, physical damage, fuel shortage)
  has similar effects. Priorities: water, food, security, communication without modern infrastructure.'
warnings:
- EMP effects are debated - some electronics may survive, others will fail unpredictably
- Long-term grid failure (months to years) would be catastrophic - most people unprepared
- Societal breakdown likely within weeks (food/water scarcity, no medical care, violence)
- False alarms and panic can be as dangerous as actual event
steps:
- 'IMMEDIATE EFFECTS: NUCLEAR EMP (high-altitude detonation): (1) Electronics fail instantly (some shielded devices may survive). (2) Power grid collapses. (3) Vehicles with electronic ignition may not
  start (older vehicles more likely to survive). (4) No phone, internet, radio, GPS. (5) Water pumps stop (city water fails within hours). SOLAR STORM (Carrington Event scale): Similar but slower onset.
  Electrical grid damaged by induced currents. CYBERATTACK/PHYSICAL GRID DAMAGE: Localized or cascading power failures.'
- 'FIRST 24 HOURS: (1) STAY HOME (roads will be chaotic - disabled vehicles, panicked people). (2) FILL CONTAINERS WITH WATER immediately (while pressure remains). Every container. Bathtubs, pots, bottles.
  (3) INVENTORY SUPPLIES: food, water, medicine, tools, weapons. (4) SECURE HOME: lock doors, arm yourself, establish watches. (5) ASSESS SITUATION: Is this local or widespread? How long might it last?
  Try battery-powered AM/FM radio (may still function).'
- 'WHAT STOPS WORKING: (1) Electricity. (2) Internet and cell phones. (3) Municipal water (pumps fail). (4) Sewage treatment. (5) Gas stations (pumps need power). (6) Refrigeration (food spoils). (7) Banking
  and electronic payments. (8) Most modern vehicles. (9) Medical devices (oxygen concentrators, insulin pumps, etc.). (10) Supply chains (food, medicine, fuel deliveries stop).'
- 'WHAT KEEPS WORKING: (1) Bicycles and older vehicles (pre-1980s more likely to survive EMP). (2) Hand tools. (3) Firearms and bows. (4) Manually-pumped wells. (5) Wood stoves. (6) Books and paper records.
  (7) Battery-powered flashlights/radios (if shielded or not connected during pulse). (8) Human knowledge and skills.'
- 'SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL (days to weeks): (1) WATER: Collect rainwater, find natural sources, purify (boil, filter, bleach). (2) FOOD: Eat perishables first, ration shelf-stable food. Forage, hunt, fish.
  (3) SECURITY: Form neighborhood watch. Arm and defend resources. Expect looting and violence. (4) SANITATION: Dig latrines away from water sources. Burn or bury waste. (5) COMMUNICATION: Establish foot/bike
  messengers. Ham radio (if equipment survived and you have operator).'
- 'LONG-TERM ADAPTATION (months to years): (1) AGRICULTURE: Plant gardens immediately. Raise animals. (2) COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION: Skills-based division of labor (farmers, hunters, builders, medics, guards).
  (3) ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: Solar panels (if survived), wind, hydro, manual power. (4) TRADE NETWORKS: Barter system. (5) SECURITY GROUPS: Mutual defense pacts with nearby communities. (6) EDUCATION: Preserve
  knowledge. Teach young people practical skills. (7) GOVERNANCE: Establish rules, conflict resolution, justice system.'
- 'LIKELIHOOD: Full-scale EMP or solar storm is low-probability but high-impact. More likely: regional grid failures from storms, attacks, infrastructure decay. Prepare for temporary disruptions (days to
  weeks) and you will be better prepared for worst-case permanent collapse.'

# EMP & Grid-Down Scenarios — Electronics Failure & Recovery

Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear detonation or solar storm can disable electronics and power grid over large areas. Grid-down from other causes (cyberattack, physical damage, fuel shortage) has similar effects. Priorities: water, food, security, communication without modern infrastructure.
