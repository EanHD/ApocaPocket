summary: Certain wild plants have antimicrobial properties and can be used as poultices for wound care when modern first aid is unavailable. Not a replacement for proper wound cleaning and antibiotics but
  better than nothing.
warnings:
- Clean wounds with water first - plant matter on dirty wounds can introduce infection
- These herbs reduce infection risk but do not replace antibiotics for serious infections
- Infected wounds (red, hot, swollen, pus, fever) require medical care
- Allergic reactions to plant poultices can occur - test on small skin area first
steps:
- 'PLANTAIN (Plantago species - not banana): Leaves have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. PREPARATION: (1) Chew fresh leaves into paste (saliva activates compounds) OR crush with rock. (2)
  Apply directly to clean wound. (3) Cover with cloth bandage. Change 2-3x per day. USES: Minor cuts, scrapes, insect stings, minor burns. Very common weed, easy to identify.'
- 'YARROW (Achillea millefolium): Leaves and flowers stop bleeding and prevent infection. PREPARATION: Crush fresh plant, apply to bleeding wound, press firmly. OR make tea, use as wound wash. Traditional
  field medicine for battle wounds. Astringent and antimicrobial.'
- 'HONEY (if available): Raw honey is highly antimicrobial and promotes healing. Spread thin layer on clean wound, cover with bandage. Change daily. Medical-grade honey (Manuka) is used in hospitals for
  wound care. Any raw honey is better than nothing.'
- 'PINE PITCH/RESIN: Sticky antiseptic sealant. Heat pine resin until soft, apply to wound (test temp first - do not burn). Forms protective barrier. Antimicrobial. Removal is difficult (oil/fat to dissolve).'
- 'GARLIC: Crush raw garlic, mix with small amount of oil, apply as poultice (not directly on open wound - very irritating). Strong antimicrobial (allicin). Use for infected wounds with caution.'
- 'WOUND CLEANING: Before applying any plant remedy, clean wound with cleanest water available. Boiled and cooled water if possible. Remove debris. Pat dry. Then apply poultice. Change daily and monitor
  for infection signs.'
