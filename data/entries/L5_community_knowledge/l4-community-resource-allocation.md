# Community Resource Allocation

**Category:** L4 - Community Dynamics  
**Survival Importance:** CRITICAL - Unfair distribution destroys communities faster than scarcity  
**Difficulty:** High  
**Prerequisites:** Resource inventory, governance structure, conflict resolution system  

---

## Why This Matters

**The Allocation Paradox:** Communities often have enough resources to survive, but fail because of how they distribute them. History shows that *perceived unfairness* causes more conflict than actual scarcity.

**Research Foundation:**
- **Equity Theory (Adams, 1965):** People compare inputs (work) to outputs (rewards). Perceived unfairness triggers resentment.
- **Tragedy of the Commons (Hardin, 1968):** Without clear allocation rules, shared resources get depleted.
- **Ostrom's Principles (1990):** Successful commons management requires clear rules, monitoring, graduated sanctions, and conflict resolution.

**Historical Reality:**
- **Plymouth Colony (1620-1623):** Initial communal farming failed; individual plots succeeded
- **Kibbutzim (Israel):** Various models tested; equal sharing worked when voluntary and ideologically motivated
- **Jamestown (1607-1610):** Resource conflicts led to cannibalism (Starving Time)
- **Successful cooperatives:** Mondragon, REI, credit unions - clear allocation rules key to survival

## Core Allocation Methods

### Method 1: Equal Shares (Egalitarian)
**Principle:** Everyone gets exactly the same, regardless of contribution

**Formula:** Total Resources ÷ Number of People = Per Person Share

**Pros:**
- Extreme simplicity
- No calculation disputes
- Symbolic equality
- Supports those unable to contribute (sick, elderly, children)

**Cons:**
- Discourages high performers ("Why work harder?")
- Ignores different needs (pregnant woman = adult man?)
- Can feel unfair to heavy contributors
- May waste resources (giving hunting gear to non-hunters)

**Best For:**
- Small communities with shared ideology
- Survival essentials (water, basic food)
- Communities prioritizing social cohesion over efficiency
- Short-term crisis (everyone pulls together)

**Example Distribution:**
```
Total: 20 pounds of food
People: 10
Each person: 2 pounds (regardless of work done)
```

---

### Method 2: Need-Based (To Each According to Need)
**Principle:** Allocate based on actual requirements, not work or status

**Assessment Factors:**
- Age (children, elderly)
- Health (illness, pregnancy, injury)
- Physical demands (heavy labor = more calories)
- Dependents (caring for others)
- Special requirements (medical conditions)

**Pros:**
- Compassionate and humane
- Supports vulnerable members
- Prevents medical/nutritional crises
- High moral legitimacy

**Cons:**
- Complex to assess fairly
- Requires trust (people might fake needs)
- Can create dependency
- High contributors may resent supporting low contributors

**Best For:**
- Medical supplies
- Essential food in scarcity
- Communities with strong solidarity
- Caring for children, sick, elderly

**Example Distribution:**
```
Total: 3000 calories/day available
- Pregnant woman: 400 cal (higher need)
- Manual laborer: 500 cal (high energy expenditure)
- Elderly sedentary: 250 cal (lower need)
- Child (age 8): 300 cal (growing)
- Sick person: 350 cal (healing)
- Average adult: 200 cal each (remaining 5 people)
```

---

### Method 3: Contribution-Based (Meritocratic)
**Principle:** You get what you earn through work, skill, or past investment

**Contribution Metrics:**
- Hours worked
- Task difficulty/danger
- Skill level required
- Results achieved
- Past contributions (reputation capital)

**Pros:**
- Motivates high performance
- Rewards hard work
- Efficient resource use
- Attracts and retains talent

**Cons:**
- Penalizes unable to contribute (sick, disabled, children)
- Hard to measure contributions fairly
- Can create class divisions
- Ignores unpaid work (childcare, emotional labor)

**Best For:**
- Non-essential goods
- Luxury items
- Communities valuing productivity
- Trade between communities

**Example Distribution:**
```
Total: 100 labor credits worth of goods
- Person A: 30 credits (high-skill medical work)
- Person B: 25 credits (dangerous scouting)
- Person C: 20 credits (consistent farm work)
- Person D: 15 credits (part-time teaching)
- Person E: 10 credits (limited work due to injury)
```

---

### Method 4: Hybrid Systems (Recommended)
**Principle:** Combine methods for different resource types

**Tiered Allocation Model:**
1. **Tier 1 - Basic Survival Needs:** Equal or need-based
   - Water, staple food, basic shelter, essential medicine
   - Principle: "No one goes without"

2. **Tier 2 - Standard Living:** Contribution-based with floor
   - Better food, clothing, personal items
   - Principle: "Contribute to get more, but everyone gets minimum"

3. **Tier 3 - Luxuries:** Pure contribution-based or market
   - Coffee, chocolate, alcohol, entertainment
   - Principle: "Extras are earned"

**Pros:**
- Balances fairness and motivation
- Protects vulnerable while rewarding work
- Culturally familiar (most societies use hybrid)
- Flexible for different contexts

**Cons:**
- More complex to administer
- Boundary disputes (Is X essential or luxury?)
- Requires documentation

**Example Framework:**
```
RESOURCE TIER CLASSIFICATION:

Tier 1 (Equal/Need-Based):
☑ Water (1 gallon/person/day minimum)
☑ Staple calories (1800 cal/day minimum)
☑ Basic shelter (bed, roof, heat)
☑ Critical medicine (life-saving only)

Tier 2 (Contribution + Floor):
☑ Additional food (protein, vegetables, variety)
☑ Clothing (work gear, seasonal)
☑ Personal hygiene items
☑ Non-critical medicine

Tier 3 (Earned):
☑ Sweets, coffee, alcohol
☑ Entertainment items
☑ Personal hobbies
☑ Upgraded living space
```

## Labor Division Systems

### Challenge: How to assign work fairly?

**The Labor Problem:**
- Some work is dangerous (scouting, hunting)
- Some work is unpleasant (latrine cleaning, butchering)
- Some work is skilled (medical, mechanical)
- Some work is invisible (childcare, emotional labor)
- Some people are more capable than others

---

### Labor Credit System (Recommended)

**How It Works:**
1. Define standard work unit (1 credit = 1 hour of average difficulty work)
2. Assign multipliers for difficulty/skill/danger
3. Track credits earned
4. Use credits to access Tier 2/3 resources

**Labor Credit Multipliers:**

| Work Type | Multiplier | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Standard work** (gardening, cooking, cleaning) | 1.0x | Baseline |
| **Unpleasant work** (latrine, butchering, corpse handling) | 1.5x | Compensation for discomfort |
| **Dangerous work** (hunting, scouting, height work) | 2.0x | Risk premium |
| **High-skill work** (medical, engineering, teaching) | 1.5-2.0x | Years of training |
| **Night watch** (security, guard duty) | 1.3x | Disrupted sleep |
| **Emotional labor** (conflict mediation, grief support) | 1.2x | Often invisible but draining |
| **Childcare** (watching children <12) | 1.0-1.3x | Essential but undervalued |

**Credit Tracking:**
```
Example Weekly Log:

Sarah:
Mon: 4 hrs gardening (1.0x) = 4 credits
Tue: 3 hrs medical work (2.0x) = 6 credits
Wed: 2 hrs butchering (1.5x) = 3 credits
Thu: 4 hrs teaching (1.5x) = 6 credits
Fri: Rest day = 0 credits
Total: 19 credits

Tom:
Mon: 8 hrs scouting (2.0x) = 16 credits
Tue-Thu: 12 hrs carpentry (1.2x) = 14.4 credits
Fri: 4 hrs laundry (1.0x) = 4 credits
Total: 34.4 credits
```

**Spending Credits:**
- Tier 2: 10-20 credits/week for standard living
- Tier 3: Varies (luxury items, extra space, etc.)
- Credits expire annually (prevent hoarding)
- Can gift credits to others

---

### Rotating Undesirable Work

**Problem:** No one wants to clean latrines, but it must be done.

**Solution: Rotation Schedule**

**Weekly Rotation (10-person community):**
```
Week 1: Person A does latrines (gets 1.5x credits)
Week 2: Person B does latrines
Week 3: Person C does latrines
...
Week 10: Person J does latrines
Week 11: Back to Person A
```

**Exemptions:**
- Medical contraindications (immune compromised, injury)
- Age (<16 or >65)
- Pregnancy (later stages)

**Refusal Consequences:**
- 1st refusal: Warning + community discussion
- 2nd refusal: Reduction in Tier 2 allocation
- 3rd refusal: Formal conflict resolution (see l4-community-conflict-resolution.md)

---

### Skill Matching Protocol

**Principle:** Match people to work they can actually do well

**Process:**
1. **Skills inventory:** What can each person do?
2. **Preference survey:** What do they want to do?
3. **Needs assessment:** What work must get done?
4. **Assignment:** Match skills to needs, honoring preferences when possible

**Balance:**
- 60% preferred work (motivation)
- 30% necessary work (might not prefer)
- 10% skill-building (learn new things)

**Example Matrix:**

| Person | Skills | Prefers | Assigned |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Alex | Medical, teaching | Medical | 70% medical, 20% teaching, 10% garden |
| Jordan | Carpentry, hunting | Hunting | 50% carpentry, 30% hunting, 20% maintenance |
| Sam | Cooking, childcare | Childcare | 60% childcare, 30% cooking, 10% sewing |

## Storage and Security

### The Storage Problem

**Centralized Storage:**
**Pros:** Easier to guard, monitor, and inventory  
**Cons:** Single point of failure, requires trust in custodians

**Distributed Storage:**
**Pros:** Reduces theft risk, no single target, some autonomy  
**Cons:** Hard to inventory, can lead to hoarding, inefficient

**Hybrid Recommendation:**
- **Centralized:** Communal resources (food stores, medical supplies, tools)
- **Distributed:** Personal allocations (people keep what's been distributed to them)

---

### Access Control Systems

#### Level 1: Open Access (Low Value, Perishable)
**Examples:** Fresh vegetables from garden, library books, common tools

**System:**
- Self-service with honor system
- Sign-out sheet (so you know where things are)
- Report damage or loss
- No punishment unless pattern of abuse

---

#### Level 2: Controlled Access (Important, Trackable)
**Examples:** Preserved food, medicine, fuel, specialized tools

**System:**
- Designated keeper/custodian
- Request and approval process
- Written log (who, what, how much, when)
- Regular inventory (weekly or monthly)
- Discrepancies investigated

**Sample Log:**
```
Date: 2026-02-19
Resource: Rice (50 lb bag)
Previous Balance: 50 lbs

Transaction:
- 10:00 AM - Sarah requested 2 lbs for family meal (approved by Lee)
- 2:00 PM - Tom requested 5 lbs for community dinner (approved by Lee)
- Current Balance: 43 lbs
- Next inventory: 2026-02-26
```

---

#### Level 3: Highly Restricted (Dangerous, Scarce, High Value)
**Examples:** Weapons, antibiotics, alcohol, precious metals

**System:**
- Multiple keyholders (require 2 of 3 to open)
- Council approval for use
- Armed guard (for weapons cache)
- Daily inventory
- Video record access if possible (or witnessed log)
- Severe consequences for unauthorized access

---

### Preventing Theft and Hoarding

**Psychological Reality:** Even good people steal when desperate or when they perceive unfairness.

**Prevention Strategies:**

1. **Transparency:** Everyone can see inventories (reduces suspicion)
2. **Fairness:** If allocation is perceived as fair, less motivation to steal
3. **Buffer stocks:** Emergency reserves reduce scarcity panic
4. **Random audits:** Knowing checks happen deters theft
5. **Graduated sanctions (Ostrom):**
   - 1st offense: Warning + return item
   - 2nd offense: Loss of privileges (Tier 2 access)
   - 3rd offense: Serious consequences (extra work, temporary exile)
   - Violence/dangerous theft: Immediate separation

**Cultural Prevention:**
- Normalize asking for help (reduce shame → reduce secret hoarding)
- Celebrate generosity publicly
- Make "enough for everyone" visible (seeing full shelves reduces anxiety)

---

## Rationing Protocols (Scarcity Management)

### When to Trigger Rationing

**Indicators:**
- Current supply < 30 days at normal consumption
- Resupply unlikely or unknown
- External crisis (war, drought, winter)

**Decision Process:**
1. Inventory current stocks
2. Estimate consumption rate and duration
3. Calculate daily ration to stretch supplies
4. Announce rationing with clear timeline and reasons
5. Implement monitoring

---

### Rationing Formula

**Basic Calculation:**
```
Daily Ration = (Total Supply × Safety Factor) ÷ (People × Days to Stretch)

Where Safety Factor = 0.8-0.9 (preserve 10-20% emergency reserve)
```

**Example:**
```
Total rice: 200 lbs
People: 20
Target duration: 60 days
Safety factor: 0.85

Daily ration = (200 × 0.85) ÷ (20 × 60) = 170 ÷ 1200 = 0.14 lbs/person/day

Weekly ration: 1 lb/person
```

---

### Rationing Distribution Methods

#### Method 1: Frequent Small Distributions
**Cadence:** Daily or every 2-3 days  
**Pros:** People can't overconsume, easier to adjust  
**Cons:** High labor (constant distribution)

#### Method 2: Weekly Distributions (Recommended)
**Cadence:** Once per week  
**Pros:** Balance of control and trust, less labor  
**Cons:** Some may consume too quickly

#### Method 3: Monthly Distributions
**Cadence:** Once per month  
**Pros:** Minimal labor, trusts people  
**Cons:** High risk of running out early, hoarding

---

### Ration Ticket System

**How it works:**
- Everyone receives tickets/coupons representing their ration
- Tickets traded at "store" for goods
- Prevents double-claiming
- Allows trading between individuals (flexibility)

**Example Weekly Ticket:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════
      WEEKLY RATION - FEB 19-25
       COMMUNITY: Riverbend
───────────────────────────────────
Name: Jordan Smith
Rations:
☑ 3 lbs grain
☑ 1 lb protein (meat/beans)
☑ 2 lbs vegetables
☑ 1 unit fuel (1 gallon kerosene)

Expires: Feb 25, 2026
Must present at distribution
═══════════════════════════════════
```

---

### Adjusting Rations During Scarcity

**Tiered Reduction Protocol:**

| Severity | Tier 1 (Survival) | Tier 2 (Standard) | Tier 3 (Luxury) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Normal** | 100% (2000 cal) | Available | Available |
| **Level 1** | 100% | 50% | 0% (suspended) |
| **Level 2** | 90% (1800 cal) | 25% | 0% |
| **Level 3** | 80% (1600 cal) | 0% | 0% |
| **Critical** | 70% (1400 cal)* | 0% | 0% |

*1400 cal is absolute minimum for extended survival with light activity

**Communication is Critical:**
- Explain WHY rationing is happening
- Show the math (transparent)
- Give timeline for expected end
- Celebrate when restrictions can ease

---

## Abundance Management (The Opposite Problem)

**Surprise Reality:** Abundance can also cause problems (spoilage, waste, conflict over surplus distribution)

### Surplus Storage Strategies

#### Preservation
**Priority:** Don't let abundance rot

**Methods:**
- Drying (fruits, vegetables, meat)
- Canning (if jars available)
- Fermentation (sauerkraut, kimchi, alcohol)
- Root cellaring (potatoes, carrots, apples)
- Smoking/salting (meat, fish)

**See:** → l2-food-preservation-techniques.md

---

#### Strategic Reserve
**Concept:** "Fat cows, lean cows" - save abundance for future scarcity

**Reserve Levels:**
- **Minimum:** 30 days at full ration (insurance)
- **Target:** 90 days (seasonal buffer)
- **Ideal:** 180 days (multi-season security)

**Reserve Rules:**
- Only accessed when current < 30 days OR community vote (75%)
- Annual inventory and rotation (use oldest first)
- Clearly marked "RESERVE - DO NOT USE"

---

#### Surplus Distribution Options

**Option 1: Equal Shares**
Everyone gets same bonus amount

**Option 2: Contribution Bonus**
Those who produced surplus get larger share

**Option 3: Save for Future**
All goes to reserves

**Option 4: Community Decision**
Vote on what to do with surplus

**Option 5: Trade**
Exchange surplus for other needs with neighboring communities

**Recommendation:** Use different options for different surplus types
- Food surplus → 50% reserves, 50% equal distribution
- Luxury surplus → Trade or contribution bonus
- Tool surplus → Save for replacement / trade

---

## Inter-Community Trade Systems

### Barter Economy Basics

**Challenge:** No money, must trade goods directly

**The "Double Coincidence of Wants" Problem:**
You have chickens, need medicine → Must find someone who has medicine AND wants chickens

---

### Trade System 1: Direct Barter
**Method:** Negotiate each trade individually

**Example:**
"I'll give you 10 eggs for 1 pound of flour"

**Pros:** Simple, flexible  
**Cons:** Time-consuming, hard to value fairly

**Typical Exchange Rates (Examples):**
```
1 lb flour = 10 eggs = 2 lbs potatoes = 4 hours unskilled labor
1 lb coffee = 5 lb flour = 50 eggs = 10 lb potatoes
1 medical treatment = 20 lb flour = 200 eggs = 40 hours labor
```

---

### Trade System 2: Labor Credit Exchange
**Method:** Communities honor each other's labor credits

**How it works:**
1. Your community issues labor credits for work
2. Neighboring community agrees to accept them
3. You spend credits at either community
4. Communities settle balance quarterly (goods or labor)

**Pros:** Flexibility, solves double coincidence problem  
**Cons:** Requires trust, accounting, stable relationships

---

### Trade System 3: Trade Fairs
**Method:** Periodic markets where multiple communities gather

**Format:**
- Monthly or quarterly gathering
- Central location
- Trading area + social area
- Rules enforced by rotating security from all communities

**Benefits:**
- Price discovery (what is X worth?)
- News exchange
- Social bonds between communities
- Variety (more trading partners)
- Cultural exchange

**Risks:**
- Theft
- Disease transmission
- Conflict between communities
- Travel danger

**Mitigations:**
- Small delegations (3-5 people)
- Health screening
- Neutral meeting ground
- Shared security rules
- Dispute arbitration process

---

## Dispute Resolution for Allocation Conflicts

### Common Disputes

1. **"My share is smaller!"** (Measurement disputes)
2. **"They're faking high need!"** (Need assessment disputes)
3. **"I worked more, should get more!"** (Contribution disputes)
4. **"The system is unfair!"** (Policy disputes)

---

### Resolution Process

#### Step 1: Verify Facts
- Re-measure portions
- Check work logs
- Review documentation
- Hear witnesses

#### Step 2: Check Against Rules
- Is the allocation following documented policy?
- If yes → Explain why it seems unfair
- If no → Correct the allocation

#### Step 3: Assess Legitimacy
**Legitimate complaint:** Policy was followed but outcome seems genuinely unfair  
**Action:** Bring to community for policy review

**Illegitimate complaint:** Policy was followed and fair, person just wants more  
**Action:** Explain, offer mediation if persistent

#### Step 4: Appeal Process
1. Initial complaint to resource manager
2. Appeal to council/leadership
3. Community meeting (if affects policy)
4. Vote on policy change if needed

**Timeline:** Resolve within 1 week maximum (resource disputes fester)

---

### Transparency as Dispute Prevention

**Public Information:**
- Total resources available
- Allocation formulas
- Distribution records
- Who decided what

**Private Information:**
- Individual medical conditions (privacy)
- Specific credit balances (optional privacy)

**Recommendation:** Default to transparency unless privacy concern

---

## Special Populations

### Children
**Allocation Principle:** Need-based (growing, can't fully contribute)

**Challenges:**
- Different needs by age
- Can they earn credits? (Age 12-16: partial work)
- Who gets their rations? (Parents/guardians)

**Recommendation:**
- Age 0-12: Full need-based rations, no work expected
- Age 12-16: Need-based rations + can earn bonus credits
- Age 16+: Transition to adult system

---

### Elderly
**Allocation Principle:** Need-based + credit for lifetime contribution

**Challenges:**
- Reduced work capacity
- Increased medical needs
- Dignity and respect

**Recommendation:**
- Basic rations guaranteed (lifetime contribution)
- Lighter work assignments (mentoring, childcare, craft work)
- Honor and involve in decisions (wisdom has value)

---

### Sick/Injured
**Allocation Principle:** Need-based during recovery

**Challenges:**
- Temporary vs permanent disability
- Malingering risk
- Return to work timing

**Recommendation:**
- Medical certification of need
- Graduated return (50% work capacity → 50% credit requirement)
- Long-term disability: Community decision on support level

---

### Pregnant/Nursing
**Allocation Principle:** Increased needs (400-500 extra calories/day)

**Recommendation:**
- Increased food rations (2nd-3rd trimester: +300 cal; nursing: +500 cal)
- Lighter work assignments (no heavy lifting, chemical exposure)
- Priority for rest and medical care

---

## Emergency Reserve Management

### The Reserve Principle
**"Hope for the best, plan for the worst"**

**Reserve Minimum:** 30-day supply at survival rations (Tier 1 only)

---

### Reserve Trigger Conditions

**When to access reserves:**
1. Current supply < 30 days
2. Emergency situation (fire, flood, attack destroyed stocks)
3. Medical emergency (epidemic needs extra resources)
4. Community vote (75% supermajority)

**When NOT to access:**
- Convenience ("It's easier than making more")
- Luxury ("Let's have a feast")
- Without proper authorization

**Penalties for unauthorized reserve access:**
- Severe consequences (this threatens everyone's survival)
- Replacement requirement + additional penalty
- Possible exile if intentional and community-endangering

---

### Reserve Rotation
**Problem:** Stored food spoils

**Solution: FIFO (First In, First Out)**
- Annually review reserves
- Use oldest stock in normal rations
- Replace with fresh stock
- Document rotation dates

---

## Documentation and Record-Keeping

### Essential Records

#### 1. Inventory Logs
**Track:**
- What you have
- How much
- Where stored
- Last count date

**Format:**
```
INVENTORY LOG - Feb 19, 2026

Category: Grain
├── Rice: 150 lbs (Main storage, A3 shelf)
├── Wheat: 80 lbs (Main storage, B2 shelf)
├── Oats: 40 lbs (Root cellar, hanging bag)
└── Corn meal: 25 lbs (Kitchen, sealed container)

Last count: Feb 15, 2026
Next count: Mar 1, 2026
```

---

#### 2. Distribution Records
**Track:**
- Who got what
- When
- How much
- Authorized by whom

**Retention:** Keep 1 year minimum (pattern analysis, dispute resolution)

---

#### 3. Labor Credit Logs
**Track:**
- Who worked
- What task
- How many hours
- Credit multiplier
- Total credits earned

**Update:** Weekly minimum, daily for large communities

---

#### 4. Policy Documents
**Must Document:**
- Allocation formulas
- Credit multipliers
- Rationing triggers and procedures
- Appeal process
- Amendment procedures

**Review:** Quarterly, update as learned

---

## Case Studies

### Success: Mondragon Cooperative
**System:** Contribution-based income within solidarity caps (highest paid = 6x lowest)

**Key Features:**
- Democratic governance (workers own/control)
- Transparent pay ratios
- Profit sharing
- Unemployment insurance (internal)
- Pension system

**Results:** 70+ years of stability, survived 2008 crisis better than conventional firms

**Lesson:** Balance between contribution rewards and solidarity limits works

---

### Mixed: Kibbutzim (Israel)
**Original System (1910-1980s):** Radical egalitarianism
- Equal shares regardless of work
- Communal dining, childcare, property
- High ideology, voluntary membership

**Results:** 
- Worked well when ideologically motivated
- Younger generations rejected model
- Most reformed to hybrid (1980s-2000s)

**Current System:** Privatized (families keep earnings, buy own goods)

**Lessons:**
- Pure egalitarianism requires strong shared ideology
- Generational turnover challenges radical systems
- Flexibility to adapt extends survival

---

### Failure: Jamestown (1607-1610)
**System:** Common store (all food communal, equal distribution)

**Problems:**
- Gentlemen refused manual labor ("beneath their status")
- Workers saw no benefit from extra effort
- Resentment and conflict
- Theft from stores
- "Starving Time": Cannibalism, 80% death rate

**Reform (1611):** Private plots + trade
- Immediate productivity increase
- Surplus within 2 years

**Lesson:** Without incentives OR strong ideology, equal distribution fails

## Quick Reference: Resource Allocation Decision Tree

```
NEW RESOURCE ACQUIRED
        ↓
Is it survival-critical? (water, food, medicine)
    ├── YES → Tier 1: Equal or need-based
    └── NO → Continue
        ↓
Is it necessary but not critical? (clothing, tools)
    ├── YES → Tier 2: Contribution-based with floor
    └── NO → Tier 3: Pure contribution-based or luxury
        ↓
Is there enough for everyone?
    ├── YES → Equal distribution or store surplus
    └── NO → Rationing protocol
        ↓
Document allocation + distribute + monitor
```

## Critical Principles Summary

✓ **Fairness perception matters more than actual fairness** - Communicate clearly  
✓ **Hybrid systems work best** - Different methods for different resources  
✓ **Transparency prevents conflict** - Show the math, open books  
✓ **Labor credits balance contribution and solidarity** - Reward work, support unable  
✓ **Reserves are sacred** - Protect 30-day minimum  
✓ **Graduated sanctions for violations** - Warn, then escalate  
✓ **Abundance needs management too** - Preserve, store, distribute wisely  
✓ **Document everything** - Memory fails, disputes happen  
✓ **Adjust system based on feedback** - No perfect system, iterate
