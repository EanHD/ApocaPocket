summary: 'Forced displacement (war, persecution, disaster) requires survival skills for travel, hiding, border crossing, and evading threats. Based on military evasion tactics and refugee experiences. Priorities:
  stay hidden, move at night, avoid official checkpoints, find safe passage.'
warnings:
- Border crossing is illegal in most situations - weigh risks of capture vs staying
- Refugees are vulnerable to exploitation, violence, trafficking
- Children and elderly are at highest risk during displacement
- Governments may detain, deport, or harm refugees
steps:
- 'DECISION TO LEAVE: Leave early if possible (before borders close, before roads clogged). PACK LIGHT: Water, food for 3-7 days, weather-appropriate clothing, cash/valuables (gold, jewelry - portable wealth),
  documents in waterproof bag, small first aid kit, sturdy shoes. WEIGHT LIMIT: 15-20 lbs max (must walk long distances).'
- 'TRAVEL TACTICS: (1) MOVE AT NIGHT: Lower risk of detection. Use moonlight or red-filtered flashlight (preserves night vision). (2) AVOID ROADS: Use trails, ridgelines, streambeds. Roads have checkpoints,
  bandits, military. (3) COVER TRACKS: Walk on hard ground or in water when possible. Brush out footprints. (4) STAY HIDDEN BY DAY: Sleep in dense vegetation, caves, abandoned buildings. Post watch (someone
  awake at all times). (5) SMALL GROUPS: 3-5 people ideal. Larger groups attract attention, slower. Lone travel is dangerous (no backup, vulnerable to attack).'
- 'BORDER CROSSING: OFFICIAL: If possible, use legal border crossing (safer but may be denied entry, detained, or turned back). Have documents ready, story consistent. UNOFFICIAL: (1) Scout crossing area
  during day from concealment. Identify patrol patterns, fences, sensors. (2) Cross at night, during weather (rain/snow reduces visibility), or during shift changes (guards less alert). (3) Cut/dig under
  fence if necessary (use wire cutters, fold sharp edges). (4) Avoid rivers (strong current, cold water, drowning risk) unless no alternative. (5) Once across, move quickly away from border (patrols focus
  near border).'
- 'AVOIDING DETECTION: (1) No fires (smoke visible for miles). Eat cold food. (2) No lights at night. (3) Minimize talking (sound carries). Use hand signals. (4) Camouflage (natural colors, break up silhouette
  with branches/mud). (5) If pursued, move through thick vegetation, water (breaks scent trail for dogs), rocky areas (no tracks).'
- 'ENCOUNTERING HOSTILES: (1) AVOID CONTACT whenever possible (hide, wait for them to pass). (2) If confronted by officials: COMPLY (hands visible, no sudden moves). Expect detention or deportation. (3)
  If confronted by criminals/militias: SURRENDER VALUABLES. Do not resist (not worth your life). If they attempt to detain/kidnap you, LOOK FOR ESCAPE OPPORTUNITY (when distracted, at night, when group
  splits up). (4) If attacked: RUN toward dense cover. Zigzag running pattern (harder to hit). Throw belongings behind you (may distract pursuers).'
- 'SAFE HAVEN: (1) Refugee camps (UNHCR camps provide food, shelter, medical care but conditions are often poor and dangerous). (2) Churches, mosques, temples (may offer sanctuary). (3) NGOs and aid organizations.
  (4) Friends or family in safe country. (5) Rural areas away from conflict (harder to reach but less scrutiny).'
- 'LONG-TERM: Displaced persons often live in camps or undocumented in cities for years. Priorities: (1) Documentation (refugee status, asylum claim). (2) Income (under-the-table work). (3) Children education.
  (4) Community support (other refugees from your country/region).'
