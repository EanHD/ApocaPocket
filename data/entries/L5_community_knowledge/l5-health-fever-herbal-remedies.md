summary: Fever is the body fighting infection. Mild fever (under 102F) helps immune response. High fever (over 103F) is dangerous. Some herbs reduce fever by promoting sweating (diaphoretics) or contain
  aspirin-like compounds. Hydration is most important.
warnings:
- Very high fever (over 104F) is a medical emergency - can cause brain damage
- Fever in infants and young children is more dangerous - lower threshold for concern
- Herbal fever reducers are weak - prioritize cooling measures and hydration
- Persistent fever indicates infection that may require antibiotics
steps:
- 'PRIORITY: HYDRATION AND COOLING: (1) Drink water constantly (fever causes dehydration). Add salt and sugar if available (ORS). (2) Wet cloths on forehead, neck, wrists. (3) Remove excess clothing. (4)
  Shade and air circulation. These are more important than herbs.'
- 'WILLOW BARK: Contains salicin (aspirin-like). Reduces fever and inflammation. Simmer 1-2 tsp inner bark in 1 cup water, drink 2-3x per day. Effects in 1-2 hours. See pain entry for cautions.'
- 'ELDERFLOWER: Traditional diaphoretic (promotes sweating). Tea from flowers. Drink hot. Induces sweating which can help break fever. Do not use if dehydrated (sweating worsens dehydration).'
- 'YARROW: Tea from leaves/flowers. Diaphoretic. Drink hot to promote sweating. Also mild antimicrobial.'
- 'MINT: Cooling sensation, mild fever reducer. Tea from leaves. Drink cold or hot.'
- 'WHEN TO SEEK HELP: Fever over 103F, fever lasting more than 3 days, fever with severe headache/stiff neck (meningitis), fever with difficulty breathing, fever with confusion. These indicate serious infection
  requiring medical care.'
