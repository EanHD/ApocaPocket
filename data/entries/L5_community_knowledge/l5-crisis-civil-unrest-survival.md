summary: 'Civil unrest (protests, riots, looting, violence) can erupt suddenly due to political, economic, or social triggers. Survival priorities: avoid danger zones, secure home, escape if necessary.
  Based on DHS active threat response and historical unrest patterns.'
warnings:
- Crowds are unpredictable and dangerous - avoid large gatherings during unrest
- Police and military may use force indiscriminately - comply or evade
- Looters and opportunistic criminals exploit chaos
- Fire is a major threat during riots (Molotov cocktails, arson)
steps:
- 'SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: (1) Monitor news and social media for early warnings (protests planned, tensions rising). (2) Identify danger zones (government buildings, police stations, major intersections,
  commercial areas). (3) Know multiple evacuation routes from home and work. (4) Have bug-out bag ready (see entry).'
- 'IF YOU ARE CAUGHT IN A RIOT: (1) LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. Do not spectate - riots turn violent without warning. (2) Move perpendicular to crowd flow (not against - you will be trampled). Head toward less crowded
  side streets. (3) Stay on feet (if you fall in a crowd, you will be trampled - protect head, try to stand). (4) Avoid police lines (tear gas, rubber bullets, arrests). (5) Enter buildings if possible
  (ask business owners for refuge). (6) Cover face (mask or cloth) to reduce tear gas exposure. (7) If tear gas: move upwind, rinse eyes with water (not milk - myth), breathe through wet cloth.'
- 'HOME DEFENSE DURING UNREST: (1) BARRICADE: Lock and reinforce doors. Board windows if possible. Move valuables away from windows. (2) LIGHTS: Keep lights off (do not advertise occupancy). Use flashlight
  only when necessary. (3) WEAPONS: Arm yourself. Position near entry points. Do not confront large groups - shoot only if they breach home. (4) FIRE WATCH: Molotov cocktails and arson are common. Have
  extinguisher or water buckets ready. If fire starts, evacuate immediately. (5) LOW PROFILE: Do not respond to provocation. Stay silent and hidden.'
- 'LOOTING DEFENSE: (1) Board windows and doors. (2) Place signs - NOT WORTH DYING FOR or WE HAVE NOTHING. (3) Do not shoot at looters unless they enter your home (escalation risk - crowds turn on defenders).
  (4) If overwhelmed, let them loot - possessions can be replaced, your life cannot.'
- 'WHEN TO EVACUATE: (1) Fire nearby (smell smoke, see flames). (2) Armed groups approaching home. (3) Police/military ordering evacuation. (4) Unrest spreading uncontrollably. EVACUATION: (1) Grab bug-out
  bag. (2) Use back exits (not front door - may be watched). (3) Move through alleys and yards (not main streets). (4) Head to pre-planned safe house (friend/family outside city) or rural area. (5) Travel
  in small group if possible (safety in numbers but harder to hide).'
- 'CHECKPOINTS: If you encounter police/military checkpoints: (1) COMPLY (hands visible, no sudden movements). (2) Have ID ready. (3) Answer questions calmly. (4) Do not argue or resist (survival is priority).
  If checkpoint is hostile (non-official, armed gangs): (1) AVOID if possible. (2) Turn back or take alternate route. (3) If unavoidable, comply, give up valuables, do not resist. (4) If they try to detain
  you (kidnapping risk), RUN if you see opportunity.'
