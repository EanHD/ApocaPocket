summary: 'Checkpoints appear during unrest, martial law, war, or border crossings. May be official (military, police) or unofficial (militias, gangs, bandits). Survival priorities: assess threat level,
  comply or evade based on risk, negotiate if possible. Based on military survival training.'
warnings:
- Checkpoints are unpredictable - even official ones can be dangerous
- Armed groups at checkpoints may rob, detain, assault, or kill travelers
- Running from checkpoint risks being shot
- Bribes may be expected but also mark you as a target
steps:
- 'CHECKPOINT IDENTIFICATION: From distance, assess: (1) OFFICIAL: Uniformed personnel, vehicles, barriers, flags, organized setup. Generally safer (unless corrupt regime). (2) UNOFFICIAL: Mixed clothing,
  improvised barriers, lack of organization. HIGH RISK - likely criminals or militia. (3) AMBUSH: No visible checkpoint, people hiding, obstacles blocking road. EXTREME RISK - prepare to flee. (4) ABANDONED:
  No personnel. May be safe to pass or could be ambush/trap.'
- 'DECISION TREE: OFFICIAL CHECKPOINT (government/military): COMPLY (approach slowly, hands visible, no sudden moves). Have ID and documents ready. Answer questions. Expect searches. Bribes may be required.
  UNOFFICIAL CHECKPOINT (armed civilians): EXTREME CAUTION. Options: (1) Turn around if not yet committed. (2) Approach with extreme caution if no alternative route. Be prepared to give up valuables. Do
  not resist. (3) If they attempt to detain you (kidnapping risk), look for escape opportunity. AMBUSH: DO NOT APPROACH. Turn around or drive off-road if possible. If fired upon, accelerate through or flee
  into cover.'
- 'APPROACHING CHECKPOINT: (1) SLOW DOWN well before checkpoint (sudden braking looks suspicious). (2) TURN ON INTERIOR LIGHTS (night time - shows you are not hiding anything). (3) HANDS VISIBLE (both hands
  on steering wheel, or raised if walking). (4) NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS (reaching for documents - tell them first - I am reaching for my ID in my pocket). (5) OBEY COMMANDS immediately. (6) STAY CALM (nervousness
  is normal but excessive fear looks suspicious).'
- 'INTERACTION: (1) BE POLITE (yes sir, no sir). Do not argue or show disrespect. (2) ANSWER QUESTIONS simply and consistently. Do not volunteer extra information. (3) DOCUMENTS: Have ID, vehicle registration,
  travel permits ready. (4) SEARCHES: Allow searches without complaint. Do not touch searchers or make them feel threatened. (5) BRIBES: If requested, negotiate calmly (I only have X amount). Pay if reasonable
  and refusal risks harm.'
- 'RED FLAGS (signs checkpoint is extremely dangerous): (1) Demand you exit vehicle with hands up. (2) Separate family members. (3) Ask where your money/valuables are (robbery intent). (4) Intoxicated or
  erratic behavior. (5) No clear reason for stop (just harassment). If you see red flags: (1) Comply but stay alert for escape opportunity. (2) Do not resist. (3) If they try to force you away from vehicle
  or into building (kidnapping/execution risk), RUN if you see any chance. Better to risk being shot while running than certain death.'
- 'ESCAPE FROM CHECKPOINT: (1) Vehicle: If not yet stopped, hard U-turn or off-road. Accelerate. Zigzag driving (harder to hit). Sacrifice vehicle if necessary (flee on foot). (2) On foot: Run toward dense
  cover (buildings, forest). Zigzag. Throw valuables behind you (may distract pursuers). Do not look back (slows you down). (3) After escape: Hide for hours (they may search area). Change direction multiple
  times. Avoid roads.'
- 'AVOIDING CHECKPOINTS: (1) Scout routes in advance (ask locals where checkpoints are). (2) Use back roads, trails, or cross-country travel. (3) Travel at times checkpoints are less active (early morning,
  meal times). (4) Locals often know safe passages - hire guide if possible.'
