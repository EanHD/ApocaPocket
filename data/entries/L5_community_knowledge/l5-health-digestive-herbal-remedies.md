summary: Many wild plants have traditional use for digestive issues (diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps). Not replacements for modern medicine but can provide relief when medical care is unavailable. Learn
  identification carefully.
warnings:
- Plant medicine is not as reliable or fast-acting as modern pharmaceuticals
- Misidentification can be deadly - only use plants you are 100 percent certain about
- Pregnant women should avoid many medicinal herbs
- Some herbs interact with medications
- Persistent severe symptoms require medical care
steps:
- 'FOR DIARRHEA: (1) BLACKBERRY/RASPBERRY LEAVES: Tea from leaves (high in tannins, astringent). Steep 1 Tbsp dried leaves in boiling water 10 min. Drink 1-2 cups per day. (2) OAK BARK: Inner bark tea (very
  high tannins). Simmer 1 tsp bark in 1 cup water for 10 min. Drink 1/4 cup 3x per day. Strong astringent. (3) Acorns (after leaching): Consume small amounts - tannins slow digestion.'
- 'FOR NAUSEA/STOMACH UPSET: (1) WILD MINT (Mentha species): Fresh or dried leaves as tea. Soothes stomach, reduces nausea. Common near water. (2) GINGER (if available): Chew raw ginger root or make tea.
  Powerful anti-nausea. (3) YARROW: Tea from leaves/flowers. Bitter but settles stomach.'
- 'FOR STOMACH CRAMPS: (1) CHAMOMILE (wild species): Flower tea. Relaxes smooth muscle. (2) CATNIP: Tea from leaves. Mild sedative, reduces cramps.'
- 'PREPARATION: Most herbal teas: steep 1-2 tsp dried herb (or 1 Tbsp fresh) in 1 cup boiling water for 10 min. Strain. Drink warm. Dosage: 1-3 cups per day. Effects are mild and gradual.'
- 'LIMITATIONS: Herbal remedies work slowly. For severe diarrhea causing dehydration, prioritize ORS (oral rehydration solution). For persistent vomiting/diarrhea, seek medical care if possible.'
