summary: Wild plants with traditional use for coughs, congestion, sore throat. Steam inhalation and expectorant teas can provide symptomatic relief. Not a replacement for antibiotics if infection is bacterial.
warnings:
- Respiratory infections can be life-threatening - herbal remedies are supportive care only
- Difficulty breathing, high fever, bloody sputum require urgent medical attention
- Do not use herbs as substitute for asthma medications
- Allergic reactions to plant medicines can occur
steps:
- 'FOR COUGH/CONGESTION: (1) PINE NEEDLE TEA: Simmer young pine needles in water 10 min. High in vitamin C, aromatic oils help clear congestion. Drink hot. (2) MULLEIN: Leaves or flowers steeped as tea.
  Traditional expectorant (helps cough up phlegm). (3) WILLOW BARK: Contains salicylic acid (aspirin-like). Reduces pain and inflammation. Simmer bark 10 min. Bitter tea.'
- 'FOR SORE THROAT: (1) SLIPPERY ELM: Inner bark creates slimy coating when mixed with water. Soothes throat irritation. Chew bark or make tea. (2) HONEY (if available): Raw honey coats throat, antimicrobial
  properties. (3) SAGE: Gargle with sage tea (astringent, antimicrobial).'
- 'STEAM INHALATION: (1) Boil water with aromatic plants (pine, mint, eucalyptus if available). (2) Remove from heat. (3) Lean over pot, drape towel over head, inhale steam 5-10 min. Loosens congestion,
  eases breathing. CAUTION: Hot steam can burn face - keep safe distance.'
- 'ELDERFLOWER/ELDERBERRY: Tea from flowers or cooked berries. Traditional for colds and flu. May reduce duration of illness. Do not eat raw elderberries (toxic).'
- 'LIMITATIONS: These remedies provide symptom relief but do not cure infections. Bacterial infections (pneumonia, strep throat) require antibiotics when available. Viral infections resolve on their own
  but can be dangerous in vulnerable people.'
