summary: Deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) is one of the most poisonous plants in Europe and parts of North America. Contains tropane alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine) that cause severe nervous system effects. The attractive black berries are especially dangerous to children. Related nightshade species (black nightshade, bittersweet nightshade) have varying toxicity levels.
warnings:
- HIGHLY TOXIC - 2-5 berries can kill a child, 10-20 can kill an adult
- Berries are attractive to children - sweet taste but DEADLY
- ALL PARTS toxic - leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and especially berries
- Toxins affect nervous system, heart, and respiratory system
- No specific antidote - treatment is supportive and may require hospitalization
- Can be confused with blueberries, huckleberries, or edible black nightshade (when ripe)
- Different nightshade species have different toxicity levels - avoid ALL unless expert
- Toxins can absorb through skin in high concentrations - avoid prolonged contact

steps:
- 'DEADLY NIGHTSHADE (Atropa belladonna) IDENTIFICATION: PLANT: Perennial herb/shrub, 3-5 feet tall, bushy branching habit. STEMS: Green to purplish, branched, slightly hairy. LEAVES: Oval to elliptical, 3-8 inches long, pointed tip, smooth edges (entire), dark green, grow in alternating or paired arrangement. Dull matte surface. FLOWERS: Bell-shaped (tubular), drooping, 1 inch long, brownish-purple to greenish-purple (dull color), 5 fused petals. Bloom June-September. Single flowers hang from leaf axils. BERRIES: Shiny black (when ripe), round, 0.5 inch diameter, inside green calyx (star-shaped collar). Sweet taste. Ripen July-October. HABITAT: Disturbed areas, woodland edges, ruins, waste ground. Prefers shade and rich soil.'

- 'IDENTIFICATION KEYS TO DISTINGUISH FROM EDIBLES: DEADLY NIGHTSHADE vs BLUEBERRY/HUCKLEBERRY: Nightshade has bell-shaped dull purple flowers (blueberry has white/pink urn-shaped), nightshade berries have green star calyx at base (blueberry has crown at tip), nightshade leaves are large and dull (blueberry small and shiny). DEADLY NIGHTSHADE vs ELDERBERRY: Nightshade berries are single or few (elderberry in large flat clusters), nightshade has solid pith stem (elderberry hollow), nightshade flowers are bell-shaped purple (elderberry tiny white in flat clusters).'

- 'FIELD TREATMENT: NO SPECIFIC ANTIDOTE. Call emergency services immediately. If recent ingestion (within 30-60 min) and patient conscious: induce vomiting or give activated charcoal (1g per kg body weight). Keep patient in dark/dim environment (light causes pain with dilated pupils). Prevent self-injury during hallucinations/agitation. Monitor breathing and pulse. Keep patient cool (flushed skin indicates inability to sweat). Hospital treatment: physostigmine (antidote for anticholinergic effects) may be used in severe cases.'

# Deadly Nightshade (Belladonna) — Highly Toxic Identification

Deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) is one of the most poisonous plants in Europe and parts of North America. Contains tropane alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine) that cause severe nervous system effects. The attractive black berries are especially dangerous to children. Related nightshade species (black nightshade, bittersweet nightshade) have varying toxicity levels.

## Step-by-step Identification

### DEADLY NIGHTSHADE (Atropa belladonna)

**Critical Features:**
- **PLANT:** Perennial herb/shrub, 3-5 feet tall, bushy branching habit

- **FLOWERS:** Bell-shaped (tubular), drooping, 1 inch long, brownish-purple to greenish-purple (dull color), 5 fused petals. Bloom June-September. Single flowers hang from leaf axils
- **BERRIES:** Shiny black (when ripe), round, 0.5 inch diameter, inside green calyx (star-shaped collar). Sweet taste. Ripen July-October
- **HABITAT:** Disturbed areas, woodland edges, ruins, waste ground. Prefers shade and rich soil

### BLACK NIGHTSHADE (Solanum nigrum complex) - VARIABLE TOXICITY

- **LEAVES:** Heart-shaped to lance-shaped, often with 2 small lobes at base (looks like "ears")
- **FLOWERS:** Purple/violet star-shaped with 5 petals curved back, bright yellow center (anthers), in clusters. Distinctive appearance
- **BERRIES:** Green → yellow → orange → red when ripe. Oval, 0.3 inch, hang in clusters. All stages toxic
- **HABITAT:** Moist areas, hedges, woodland edges

## Identification Keys to Distinguish from Edibles

### DEADLY NIGHTSHADE vs BLUEBERRY/HUCKLEBERRY:
- **Flowers:** Nightshade = bell-shaped dull purple; Blueberry = white/pink urn-shaped
- **Berries:** Nightshade = green star calyx at base; Blueberry = crown at tip
- **Leaves:** Nightshade = large and dull; Blueberry = small and shiny

### DEADLY NIGHTSHADE vs ELDERBERRY:
- **Berry arrangement:** Nightshade = single or few berries; Elderberry = large flat clusters
- **Stem:** Nightshade = solid pith; Elderberry = hollow
- **Flowers:** Nightshade = bell-shaped purple; Elderberry = tiny white in flat clusters

## Symptoms of Nightshade Poisoning

**ONSET:** 15 minutes to several hours

**EARLY SYMPTOMS:**
- Dry mouth, difficulty swallowing
- Dilated pupils (very large, light sensitivity)
- Blurred vision
- Flushed dry skin

**NEUROLOGICAL:**
- Confusion, delirium, hallucinations
- Slurred speech, loss of coordination
- Restlessness, agitation

**CARDIAC:**
- Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
- Elevated blood pressure

**SEVERE:**
- Seizures, coma
- Respiratory failure
- Cardiac arrest

**DISTINCTIVE SIGN:** Dilated pupils that do not constrict in bright light is highly characteristic of nightshade poisoning

## Field Treatment

- **NO SPECIFIC ANTIDOTE** (physostigmine available in hospital)
- Call emergency services immediately
- If recent ingestion (&lt;30-60 min) and patient conscious: induce vomiting or activated charcoal (1g per kg)
- Keep patient in dark/dim environment (light causes pain with dilated pupils)
- Prevent self-injury during hallucinations/agitation
- Monitor breathing and pulse
- Keep patient cool (flushed skin indicates inability to sweat)
- Hospital treatment may include physostigmine (antidote for anticholinergic effects)

## Historical Note

Belladonna means "beautiful lady" in Italian - Renaissance women used diluted berry juice as eye drops to dilate pupils (considered attractive). Atropine (extracted from belladonna) is used medically today for eye exams, heart rhythm problems, and as antidote for nerve agent poisoning. This is a classic example of "the dose makes the poison."
