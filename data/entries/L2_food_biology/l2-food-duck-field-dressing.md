summary: Wild ducks (mallard, teal, wood duck, etc.) are common waterfowl. Dark, rich meat (high in fat compared to turkey). Pluck or skin, gut, cook thoroughly. Excellent roasted or smoked.
warnings:
- Ducks must be cooked to 165F - dark meat looks rare even when fully cooked
- Plucking ducks is difficult (feathers are waterproof) - requires hot water and patience
- Some ducks taste fishy if they feed on fish - corn-fed ducks taste better
- Protected species exist - learn to identify legal species vs protected
steps:
- 'FIELD DRESSING: (1) Cut around vent. (2) Open body cavity, remove organs. (3) Remove crop. Rinse. Save heart/liver.'
- 'PLUCKING: Very difficult due to waterproof feathers. Scald in 140-150F water for 1-2 min, pluck immediately. Down (fine feathers) is hardest to remove. OR SKINNING: Faster. Cut skin, peel away. Removes
  fat layer.'
- 'BREASTING: Alternative to full plucking. Cut along breastbone, peel back skin, carve out breast meat. Discard rest (or save legs/thighs). Fast method for survival.'
- 'COOKING: (1) Roast whole (stuff cavity, roast at 350F for 1-2 hours). (2) Breast fillets pan-seared (medium-rare to medium - dark meat). (3) Confit (slow-cook in fat). Rich, gamey flavor.'
- 'NUTRITION: High in fat and protein, iron, B vitamins. Calorie-dense.'
