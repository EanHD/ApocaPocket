# Alaska Wild Potato - Identification & Deadly Lookalike

**🚨 CRITICAL WARNING**: The Alaska wild potato (Eskimo potato) has a deadly lookalike. **ROOTS ARE SAFE. SEEDS ARE DEADLY.** This distinction killed Chris McCandless.

---

## The Two Species

### ✅ SAFE: Hedysarum alpinum (Eskimo Potato, Alpine Sweetvetch)

**What's Edible**: ROOTS ONLY  
**What's Toxic**: SEEDS (potentially toxic)  
**Harvest Season**: Spring (April-June) and Fall (September-October)

**Root Characteristics:**
- Tubers: 2-4 inches long, 1/2 to 1 inch diameter
- Color: White to pale yellow (fresh), tan when dried
- Taste: Sweet, nutty, slightly reminiscent of carrot/parsnip
- Texture: Crisp when raw, soft when cooked
- Nutritional value: High in starch, moderate protein

### ❌ TOXIC: Hedysarum mackenzii (Wild Sweet Pea)

**What's Toxic**: SEEDS CONTAIN ODAP NEUROTOXIN  
**Risk**: Paralysis, lathyrism, death  
**Critical Problem**: Looks nearly identical to H. alpinum

## 💀 The Chris McCandless Case

**August 1992, Stampede Trail, Alaska:**

**What Happened:**
1. Chris McCandless harvested what he believed were "wild potato" seeds
2. He was collecting H. alpinum but likely harvested H. mackenzii seeds by mistake
3. He consumed seeds in significant quantities (seeking calories)
4. ODAP toxin accumulated in his system
5. Symptoms: Weakness, paralysis, inability to walk or forage
6. Trapped in bus, unable to escape or hunt
7. Died of starvation, compounded by neurotoxicity

**The Mistake:**
- Seeds look virtually identical between species
- Flowers are similar (both pink/purple pea-like)
- Both grow in same habitat
- He relied on book (*Tanaina Plantlore*) that mentioned edible "wild potato" but didn't specify **roots only**

**The Lesson:**
- **Never eat wild potato seeds, even from confirmed H. alpinum**
- **Only harvest and eat the roots**
- **Absolutely certain ID required** before consuming ANY part

## 🔍 Identification Guide

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | H. alpinum (SAFE roots) | H. mackenzii (TOXIC seeds) |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Height** | 6-16 inches | 12-24 inches (taller) |
| **Stem** | Single or few stems | Multiple branching stems |
| **Leaves** | Pinnate, 13-19 leaflets | Pinnate, 11-21 leaflets |
| **Leaflet shape** | Oval, blunt tip | Narrow, pointed tip |
| **Flowers** | Pink to magenta, dense cluster | Pinkish-purple, looser cluster |
| **Bloom time** | June-July | June-August |
| **Seed pods** | 1-1.5 inches, fewer seeds | 1.5-2 inches, more seeds |
| **Root depth** | 4-8 inches | 6-12 inches (deeper) |
| **Habitat** | Alpine, tundra, well-drained | Similar, slightly wetter soils |

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: These differences are subtle. Even experts can confuse them.

### Positive Identification Steps

**Step 1: Location**
- Tundra, alpine meadows, dry riverbanks
- Open, sunny areas
- Well-drained soil
- Elevation: Sea level to 6,000 feet

**Step 2: Plant Structure**
- Pea family (Fabaceae/Leguminosae)
- Compound leaves with multiple leaflets
- Leaflets arranged pinnately (feather-like)
- No tendrils (unlike some peas)

**Step 3: Flowers (June-July)**
- Pink to deep magenta color
- Pea-like shape (banner, wings, keel)
- Clustered along stem (raceme formation)
- 1/2 to 3/4 inch long

**Step 4: Root Examination**
- Dig 4-10 inches deep
- Look for lateral tubers extending from main root
- White/yellow tubers, not brown/woody
- Sweet smell when cut

**Step 5: Cross-Verification**
- Check multiple features, not just one
- Compare with reference photos (bring laminated field guide)
- When in doubt, DON'T harvest

## 🛡️ Safe Harvesting Protocol

### Best Harvest Times

**Spring (April-June): OPTIMAL**
- Roots full of stored starch from previous year
- Plant small, easy to identify
- Sweetest flavor

**Fall (September-October): GOOD**
- Roots replenished after summer growth
- Plant dying back, easy to mark location
- Good for caching (store in cool sand)

**Summer (July-August): POOR**
- Roots depleted (feeding growth)
- Smaller, less flavorful
- Risk of confusing with H. mackenzii (both flowering)

### Harvesting Steps

**Tools Needed:**
- Digging stick or small trowel
- Knife
- Collection bag

**Process:**
1. **Positively identify plant** (use multiple features above)
2. **Mark several plants** (flags, stakes) during flowering season
3. **Wait until roots are optimal** (spring or fall)
4. **Dig carefully** 4-8 inches deep, circle around plant
5. **Extract tubers** (lateral roots extending from main taproot)
6. **Leave main root** intact if possible (sustainable harvest)
7. **Refill hole** (respect the land)
8. **Clean roots** (remove soil)

**Yield**: 2-8 tubers per plant, each 2-4 inches long

## 🍽️ Preparation & Uses

### Raw Consumption
- Wash thoroughly
- Peel skin (optional, skin is edible)
- Slice thinly
- Eat as trail snack
- Taste: Sweet, crunchy, slightly nutty

### Cooked Preparation

**Boiling** (10-15 minutes):
- Peel or leave skin on
- Boil until tender (fork-soft)
- Season with salt, fat if available
- Texture similar to potato but sweeter

**Roasting** (20-30 minutes):
- Wrap in foil or leaves
- Place in coals
- Rotate occasionally
- Done when soft throughout

**Frying** (if you have fat):
- Slice thin (1/4 inch)
- Fry in animal fat or oil
- Cook until golden and crispy
- Salt to taste

### Storage

**Short-term (1-2 weeks):**
- Keep cool and dry
- Store in ventilated bag
- Check daily for mold/rot

**Long-term (2-6 months):**
- Dry completely (slice thin, sun-dry 2-3 days)
- Store in sealed container in cool, dark place
- Rehydrate by soaking or boiling

**Winter cache:**
- Bury in sand in underground pit
- Must stay cool (32-40°F) but not freeze solid
- Check monthly

## ☠️ Toxicity Details (ODAP)

### What is ODAP?

**Chemical Name**: β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid  
**Found In**: Seeds of Hedysarum mackenzii (and possibly H. alpinum)  
**Mechanism**: Neurotoxin that mimics glutamate, over-excites neurons

### Symptoms of Lathyrism

**Early (1-3 days after consumption):**
- Weakness in legs
- Difficulty standing
- Tremors

**Moderate (3-7 days):**
- Muscle stiffness
- Paralysis of lower limbs
- Loss of bladder control

**Severe (7-14 days):**
- Permanent paralysis (if not treated)
- Respiratory difficulty
- Death (if severe and untreated)

**Recovery**: Possible if consumption stops early and medical care is available. In wilderness, recovery unlikely without evacuation.

### Toxic Dose

**Estimated**: Unknown precise dose for H. mackenzii seeds  
**Accumulation**: Builds up over days/weeks of consumption  
**Variability**: Depends on individual sensitivity, nutritional status, quantity consumed  

**Safe Approach**: Assume ALL wild potato seeds are toxic. DO NOT EAT.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't harvest seeds, ever** (even from confirmed H. alpinum)  
❌ **Don't rely on taste test** (toxic vs safe plants taste similar)  
❌ **Don't harvest without positive ID** (multiple features confirmed)  
❌ **Don't assume book is complete** (Tanaina Plantlore didn't warn about seeds)  
❌ **Don't harvest from mixed patches** (if both species present, skip it)  
❌ **Don't consume if any doubt** ("When in doubt, throw it out")

---

## ✅ Safety Checklist

**Before harvesting:**
- [ ] I can identify H. alpinum by at least 4 features (height, leaves, flowers, roots)
- [ ] I have ruled out H. mackenzii (taller, more branching)
- [ ] I am harvesting in spring or fall (optimal root season)
- [ ] I am harvesting ROOTS ONLY (never seeds)
- [ ] I have marked plants during flowering season for certainty

**Before consuming:**
- [ ] Roots are white/yellow, sweet-smelling
- [ ] No bitterness or off odors
- [ ] Cooked or raw (both safe for roots)
- [ ] No seed pods or seeds mixed in my collection

## 📚 Nutritional Information

**Per 100g of raw roots (approximate):**
- Calories: 60-80 kcal
- Carbohydrates: 15-20g (mostly starch)
- Protein: 2-3g
- Fat: <1g
- Fiber: 2-4g
- Vitamin C: 10-15mg
- Potassium: 200-300mg

**Comparison**: Similar to potato but sweeter, slightly less starchy

**Survival Value**: Excellent wild carbohydrate source in Alaska where starches are scarce

## 🗺️ Geographic Range

**Alaska**: Common throughout, especially:
- Interior (Denali region, Yukon-Tanana uplands)
- South-central (Matanuska Valley)

**Final Warning**: In the Alaska wilderness, mistaken plant ID can mean death. Chris McCandless was educated, careful, and used a field guide. He still made a fatal mistake. 

**ROOTS SAFE. SEEDS DEADLY.**

When in doubt, don't eat it. Your life depends on certainty.
