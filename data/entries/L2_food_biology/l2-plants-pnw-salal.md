summary: Salal (Gaultheria shallon) is the most abundant edible shrub in the Pacific Northwest coastal forests. Dark purple berries, similar to blueberries but mealier. Harvest August-October. Highly productive. Indigenous peoples made pemmican and fruit leather from salal.
warnings: [Salal berries are edible raw but somewhat bland and mealy, Heavy consumption can cause mild constipation (high tannin content), Salal leaves are tough and evergreen — do not eat leaves]
steps:
  - 'IDENTIFICATION: Evergreen shrub, 1-6 feet tall, forms dense thickets. LEAVES: thick, glossy, oval, alternate along stem, 2-4 inches long. FLOWERS: white-pink, bell-shaped, hanging clusters (May-July). BERRIES: dark blue-purple, round, 1/4 inch, mealy texture, slightly sweet. HABITAT: Under conifer forests, coastal areas, sea level to mid-elevations. Abundant west of Cascades.'
  - 'HARVEST: July-October (peak in August). Berries ripen unevenly — pick the darkest ones. Pull gently. One productive bush can yield 1-2 quarts. Bushes fruit heavily in sunny openings.'
  - 'USES: (1) Raw (mildly sweet, mealy). (2) Dried (make fruit leather — mash berries, spread thin on bark or cloth, sun-dry for 2-3 days. Roll into scrolls. Lasts 6-12 months). (3) Cooked in stews. (4) Mashed and mixed with fat to make pemmican. (5) Tea from leaves (traditional remedy for sore throat).'
  - 'NUTRITIONAL VALUE: Moderate vitamin C, high tannins, some antioxidants. Calorie-dense when dried. Indigenous peoples relied on salal as a winter food source.'
