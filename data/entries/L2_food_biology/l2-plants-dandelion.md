summary: "Ubiquitous perennial weed; all parts edible \\u2014 leaves, flowers, and\\ \\ roots. High in vitamins A, C, K, and iron. One of the safest beginner foraging\\ \\ plants. Available year-round in most climates.\" steps:"
- 'IDENTIFICATION: "LEAVES: Rosette of deeply toothed/lobed leaves (6-12 inches long), lobes point backward toward base (runcinate), hairless, growing from base. FLOWER: Single bright yellow composite flower (1-2 inches) on hollow stem (6-18 inches tall), no leaves on stem. STEM: Hollow, exudes white milky latex when broken. SEED HEAD: Round white fluffy seedhead (puffball). ROOT: Deep white taproot (6-18 inches). GROWTH HABIT: Low-growing perennial rosette."
- 'HARVEST TIMING: "SPRING (March-May): Young leaves are mildest, best for salads. Pre-flowering is prime time. SUMMER: Leaves become more bitter but still edible (cook to reduce bitterness). Flowers available. FALL: Second growth of tender leaves after summer heat. Roots at peak sweetness. WINTER: Roots can be dug if ground not frozen. In mild climates, leaves available year-round."
- 'EDIBLE PARTS: "LEAVES: All edible, young leaves mildest for raw use, older leaves better cooked (blanching reduces bitterness). FLOWERS: Yellow petals edible (remove green base which is bitter). Raw, fried, or wine. ROOTS: Best fall/spring. Roasted as coffee substitute, or boiled/sautéed as vegetable. STEMS: Edible but very bitter."
- 'PREPARATION METHODS: "RAW LEAVES: Young greens in salads. Mix with milder greens. COOKED LEAVES: Boil 5-10 min (change water to reduce bitterness), or sauté with garlic/oil. FLOWERS: Batter and fry (dandelion fritters), add to salads, steep for tea/wine. ROOTS: Clean, chop, roast at 300°F until dark brown for coffee substitute. Or boil/steam like carrot."
- 'NUTRITIONAL VALUE (per 100g raw leaves): "Vitamin A: 10,161 IU (203% DV), Vitamin K: 778 mcg (649% DV), Vitamin C: 35mg (58% DV), Calcium: 187mg (19% DV), Iron: 3.1mg (17% DV), Potassium: 397mg. Higher in beta-carotene than carrots. Excellent survival green."
- 'HARVEST METHODS: Use knife to cut leaves at base or dig entire plant including root. For sustainable harvest, leave some plants to regenerate. Dandelions are nearly impossible to over-harvest due to vigorous regrowth. Wash thoroughly - grit often hides in leaf base.
- 'LOOKALIKES: "Cat's Ear (Hypochaeris radicata): Branched flower stems (dandelion is single), hairy leaves (dandelion smooth), but ALSO EDIBLE. Similar use. Wild Lettuce (Lactuca species): Similar leaves with milky sap, also edible but more bitter. Hawk's Beard (Crepis): Similar flowers, edible. NO POISONOUS LOOKALIKES - dandelion is one of the safest foraging plants."
- 'REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION:
- "Worldwide in temperate zones. Native to Europe and Asia, naturalized throughout North America, Australia, New Zealand. Found in lawns, fields, roadsides, disturbed ground. Prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade. Very adaptable.' warnings:"
- Avoid areas treated with herbicides or pesticides (roadsides, treated lawns, golf courses).
- "Cat's ear (Hypochaeris radicata) is a common lookalike \\u2014 has branched stems\\ \\ and hairy leaves, but is also edible."
- Some people experience latex allergy - test small amount first if sensitive.
- "Dandelion has mild diuretic effect (increased urination) - traditional name \"piss-a-bed\". related_entries:"

## Overview
Ubiquitous perennial weed; all parts edible — leaves, flowers, and roots. High in vitamins A, C, K, and iron. One of the safest beginner foraging plants.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify by rosette of deeply toothed leaves, hollow stem, single yellow composite flower, milky latex sap.
2. Harvest young leaves before flowering for mildest flavor.
3. Flowers can be eaten raw, battered and fried, or infused.
4. Roots can be roasted as coffee substitute or boiled as vegetable.
5. Wash thoroughly; avoid roadsides and treated lawns.

## Warnings
- Avoid areas treated with herbicides or pesticides.
- Cat's ear (Hypochaeris radicata) is a common lookalike — has branched stems and hairy leaves, but is also edible.
