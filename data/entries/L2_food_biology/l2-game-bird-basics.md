## Overview
Basic knowledge of common game birds, their habits, and field preparation. Upland birds (grouse, pheasant, quail) and waterfowl (ducks, geese) are widespread protein sources.

## Step-by-step
1. Learn flight patterns and habitat preferences by species.
2. Upland birds: found in edge habitat (field/forest borders). Flush from cover.
3. Waterfowl: found on water bodies. Most active dawn/dusk during migration.
4. Field dress promptly: pluck or skin, remove crop and entrails.
5. Cook thoroughly — wild birds may carry avian parasites.

## Warnings
- Raptor and songbird hunting is widely prohibited and ecologically harmful.
- Avian influenza risk — avoid visibly sick birds.
- Always cook wild fowl well-done.
