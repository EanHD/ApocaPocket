summary: Systematic approach to estimating caloric expenditure vs intake to prevent

steps:
- 'Estimate basal metabolic rate: ~1500-1800 kcal/day for average adult at rest.'
- 'Add activity multiplier: light work 1.5x, moderate 2x, heavy labor/cold 2.5-3x.'
- Track food intake roughly by source category.
- 'If intake < expenditure: reduce non-essential activity, increase foraging priority.'
- Plan rest days into work schedules to reduce total caloric need.
warnings:
- Sustained caloric deficit causes muscle wasting, impaired judgment, and immune suppression.
- Cold environments dramatically increase caloric needs.
- Children and pregnant/nursing women need proportionally more.

## Overview
Systematic approach to estimating caloric expenditure vs intake to prevent dangerous energy debt. Critical for rationing and work planning.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate basal metabolic rate: ~1500-1800 kcal/day for average adult at rest.
2. Add activity multiplier: light work 1.5x, moderate 2x, heavy labor/cold 2.5-3x.
3. Track food intake roughly by source category.
4. If intake < expenditure: reduce non-essential activity, increase foraging priority.
5. Plan rest days into work schedules to reduce total caloric need.

## Warnings
- Sustained caloric deficit causes muscle wasting, impaired judgment, and immune suppression.
- Cold environments dramatically increase caloric needs.
- Children and pregnant/nursing women need proportionally more.
