## Overview
Wild alliums (ramps, wild garlic, field garlic) provide pungent flavor and nutrition. Identified by strong garlic/onion smell when crushed — the smell test is the key safety check.

## Step-by-step
1. Crush a leaf — must smell distinctly of garlic/onion. No smell = not allium = potential poison.
2. Identify ramps by broad elliptical leaves (1-2 per plant), red stem base, appearing in spring.
3. Field garlic (A. vineale): thin hollow leaves, small bulb clusters.
4. All parts edible: leaves, stems, bulbs. Use raw or cooked.

## Warnings
- CRITICAL: Lily of the valley (Convallaria) and death camas (Zigadenus) are deadly lookalikes — ALWAYS confirm garlic smell before eating.
- Harvest sustainably — ramps are slow-growing. Take only one leaf per plant.
