summary: Traps catch game while you sleep or work. Snares (wire loops that tighten), deadfalls (weight crushes animal), pit traps. Set multiple traps (increase odds). Check daily. Illegal in most areas
  except survival.
warnings:
- Traps are indiscriminate - can catch pets, endangered species, or injure humans
- Check legality - trapping is illegal in many jurisdictions
- Trapped animals may be injured and dangerous when you approach
- Set traps away from trails to avoid human encounters
steps:
- 'SNARE: Wire loop on game trail. Animal walks through, loop tightens around neck/body. SETUP: (1) Bend sapling or use spring pole. (2) Attach wire loop to trigger stick. (3) Animal disturbs trigger, sapling
  springs up, tightens loop. Check for rabbit, squirrel.'
- 'DEADFALL: Heavy rock balanced on trigger sticks. Animal takes bait, trigger releases, rock crushes animal. Simple but requires precise trigger. Small game only.'
- 'FIGURE-4 DEADFALL: Three sticks form Figure-4 shape. Bait on one stick. Animal pulls bait, trigger collapses, rock falls. Learn to carve notches for interlocking sticks.'
- 'PIT TRAP: Dig hole, cover with sticks and leaves (concealment). Large game falls in. Very labor-intensive. Add sharpened stakes at bottom (dangerous).'
- 'SET LOCATION: Game trails (look for tracks, droppings, worn paths). Near water, feeding areas, dens. Set 10+ traps (most will fail).'
