# Advanced Trapping - Humane & Effective Techniques

**🎯 GOAL**: Passive hunting. Set traps, check daily, harvest small-to-medium game with minimal active hunting effort.

**⚖️ ETHICS**: Traps must kill quickly or hold humanely. Suffering is unacceptable and illegal in most jurisdictions.

---

## Why Advanced Trapping?

**Advantages Over Hunting:**
1. **Passive**: Works 24/7 while you do other tasks (shelter, water, firewood)
2. **Multiple catches**: 10 traps = 10 potential meals per day
3. **Low energy**: Set and check (vs active stalking/tracking)
4. **Works while sleeping**: Nocturnal animals caught without your presence
5. **Weather independent**: Traps work in rain, snow, wind

**Requirements:**
1. Knowledge of animal behavior (trails, burrows, feeding areas)
2. Proper trap construction (kill quickly or hold safely)
3. Daily checking (24-hour rule in most areas)
4. Legal compliance (many areas restrict trapping)

## 🪤 Trap Types Overview

| Trap Type | Target Size | Kill Method | Skill Level | Materials |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Deadfall** | Small-medium | Crushing weight | Intermediate | Logs, rocks, trigger |
| **Conibear** | Small-medium | Spring-powered crush | Advanced | Metal trap (purchased) |
| **Snare** | Small-large | Strangulation | Intermediate | Wire, cordage |
| **Leg-hold** | Medium-large | Holds alive | Advanced | Metal trap (purchased) |

**Focus of This Entry**: Deadfall improvements and Conibear traps (most effective for survival)

## 🪵 Advanced Deadfall Traps

### Figure-4 Trigger (Classic)

**How It Works**: Three sticks form interlocking trigger; animal disturbs bait, weight falls

**Components:**
1. **Vertical stick** (12 inches): Notched near bottom, supports weight
2. **Horizontal stick** (8 inches): Notched both ends, holds bait
3. **Diagonal stick** (10 inches): Notched, connects vertical to horizontal
4. **Weight**: Log or rock (20-50 lbs for squirrel/rabbit)

**Assembly:**
1. Cut notches (1/4 inch deep) at specific points:
   - Vertical: Notch near bottom (3 inches from end)
   - Horizontal: Notches at both ends (90° to each other)
   - Diagonal: Notches at both ends (45° angles)
2. Lock vertical and horizontal sticks (horizontal notch hooks vertical notch)
3. Insert diagonal to stabilize (forms "4" shape)
4. Balance weight on vertical stick
5. Attach bait to horizontal stick

**Tuning**: Adjust notch depth and angles until slightest touch releases weight

**Target Animals**: Squirrels, rabbits, marmots, raccoons

**Weight Requirements:**
- Squirrel: 15-25 lbs
- Rabbit: 30-50 lbs
- Raccoon/marmot: 50-80 lbs

### Paiute Trigger (Superior Design)

**Advantages Over Figure-4:**
- More sensitive (lighter trigger pull)
- Easier to set (fewer interlocking parts)
- More reliable (less likely to false-trigger from wind)

**Components:**
1. **Vertical post** (12 inches): Stuck in ground, supports weight
2. **Horizontal bait stick** (10 inches): Tied to cordage loop
3. **Trigger stick** (3 inches): Short toggle, creates leverage
4. **Cordage**: 18 inches, connects bait stick to weight
5. **Weight**: Same as Figure-4

**Assembly:**
1. Drive vertical post into ground (6 inches deep)
2. Tie cordage into loop (one end to bait stick, other to weight)
3. Prop weight at angle (resting on vertical post)
4. Thread cordage under weight, over vertical post
5. Insert trigger stick through loop (creates tension)
6. Attach bait to horizontal stick

**How It Works**: Animal pulls bait → moves bait stick → releases trigger stick → weight falls

**Sensitivity**: Can be triggered by touch equivalent to 1-2 ounces of pull (vs 4-6 oz for Figure-4)

**Setup Time**: 5-10 minutes (once practiced)

### Deadfall Placement Strategy

**High-Probability Locations:**
1. **Game trails** (look for scat, tracks, worn path)
2. **Near burrow entrances** (create "choke point" with sticks)
3. **Along fallen logs** (animals travel on/under logs)
4. **Near food sources** (nut trees, berry bushes)
5. **Water sources** (animals must drink daily)

**Funneling Technique:**
- Place sticks, rocks, or brush to guide animal toward trigger
- Create V-shape leading to bait
- Animal naturally follows path of least resistance

**Multiple Traps:**
- Set 10-20 traps (law permitting)
- Increases odds (not every trap triggers daily)
- Space 50-100 yards apart (don't overharvest one area)

---

## ⚙️ Conibear Traps (Body-Grip)

**What They Are**: Spring-loaded metal frames that snap shut, crushing animal's chest cavity

**Advantages:**
- Instant kill (humane)
- No bait needed (set in trails)
- Reliable (metal, weatherproof)
- Reusable (decades of use)

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive ($15-40 per trap)
- Dangerous to set (can break fingers)
- Requires purchase (not improvised)
- Regulated/illegal in some areas

### Common Sizes

| Size | Jaw Spread | Target Animals |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **110** | 4.5 inches | Mink, muskrat, squirrel |
| **120** | 5 inches | Marten, mink, squirrel |
| **220** | 7 inches | Raccoon, fisher, marten, rabbit |
| **330** | 10 inches | Beaver, otter, lynx |

**Survival Kit Recommendation**: 6x 110s, 6x 220s (covers small to medium game)

### Setting a Conibear Safely

**⚠️ WARNING**: Conibears are dangerous. Use safety grips or setting tool. Can break bones.

**Steps:**
1. **Compress springs** using setting tongs or gloved hands (squeeze carefully)
2. **Lock trap open** with safety clips (keep jaws apart)
3. **Place in location** (trail, burrow entrance, water run)
4. **Attach to stake or tree** (chain prevents animal from dragging trap)
5. **Remove safety clips** (trap is now live)
6. **Test trigger** (use stick, not your hand)

**Setting Tool**: Conibear setting tongs ($20-30) - essential for safety

### Placement Strategies

**Ground Sets (Rabbit, Squirrel, Raccoon):**
- Place in narrow trail (trap fully spans width)
- Funnel with sticks (force animal through trap)
- Lean trap at 45° (animal naturally walks through)

**Water Sets (Beaver, Muskrat, Otter):**
- Place in runs (underwater paths animals use repeatedly)
- Attach to stake (animal dives, can't pull trap away)
- Position below surface (animal swims through)

**Tree Sets (Marten, Squirrel):**
- Lean trap against tree trunk
- Place bait above trap (animal climbs through trap to reach bait)
- Secure with wire (prevent drop)

---

## 🪢 Advanced Snare Techniques

### Materials

**Wire Snares (Best):**
- 22-24 gauge brass or steel wire
- 3-4 feet long per snare
- Forms loop (slips closed when pulled)
- Target: Rabbits, squirrels, grouse

**Cordage Snares (Improvised):**
- Braided plant fiber or sinew
- Less effective (stretches, breaks)
- Use only if wire unavailable

### Snare Construction

**Simple Loop:**
1. Make small fixed loop at one end (1/2 inch diameter)
2. Thread other end through fixed loop (creates slip knot)
3. Form large loop (5-6 inches for rabbit, 3-4 for squirrel)
4. Attach to stake, tree, or spring pole (drag prevention or lift)

**Snare Sizing:**

| Animal | Loop Diameter | Height Above Ground |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Squirrel | 3-4 inches | 1-2 inches |
| Rabbit | 5-6 inches | 3-4 inches |
| Grouse | 4-5 inches | 6-12 inches (body height) |

### Spring Snare (Automatic Lift)

**Purpose**: Lifts animal off ground after catch (prevents escape, protects from predators)

**Components:**
1. Snare loop (as above)
2. Bent sapling or branch (spring tension)
3. Trigger mechanism (similar to Paiute)
4. Cordage connecting snare to spring

**How It Works**: Animal enters snare → pulls trigger → spring releases → lifts animal

**Setup:**
1. Bend sapling down (2-3 feet of travel)
2. Tie cordage from sapling to trigger
3. Set trigger (Paiute-style or simple hook)
4. Attach snare loop to end of cordage

**Tuning**: Ensure sapling has enough force to lift 2-5 lb animal quickly

## 🎯 Bait Selection & Scent Control

### Effective Baits by Species

**Herbivores (Rabbit, Squirrel, Porcupine):**
- Fresh vegetables (carrot, apple, lettuce)
- Peanut butter (strong smell, hard to steal)
- Nuts (acorns, walnuts - natural food source)
- Salt lick (attracts deer, rabbits)

**Omnivores (Raccoon, Skunk, Opossum):**
- Fish (strong smell, oily)
- Canned cat food or sardines (potent attractant)
- Sweet baits (marshmallows, honey)

**Carnivores (Marten, Weasel, Fox):**
- Meat scraps (spoiled is fine, stronger smell)
- Fish heads, guts
- Feathers with blood

### Scent Control (CRITICAL)

**Why It Matters**: Human scent alerts animals (danger), reduces trap success by 50-80%

**Minimizing Human Scent:**
1. **Gloves**: Wear when handling traps (cotton or rubber)
2. **Boil traps**: Before setting, boil in water with bark, leaves (removes oils)
3. **Smoke traps**: Hang over fire (masks smell, adds natural odor)
4. **Avoid touching bait directly**: Use sticks to place
5. **Set traps from downwind**: Approach from downwind side of trail

**Lures (Optional but Effective):**
- **Commercial lures**: Muskrat musk, beaver castor, anise oil ($10-20 per bottle)
- **Natural lures**: Rotted fish, urine from target species
- Application: Small drops near trap (not on trap, attracts from distance)

## 📅 Trap Checking & Maintenance

### The 24-Hour Rule

**Legal Requirement (Most Jurisdictions)**: Traps must be checked every 24 hours

**Ethical Reasoning:**
- Prevents prolonged suffering (if animal is held alive)
- Prevents meat spoilage (dead animal in trap)
- Reduces trap theft by predators

**Survival Reality**: If you can't check daily, don't set traps. Use active hunting instead.

### Checking Procedure

**Morning Check (Ideal):**
1. Walk trapline (same route, same time daily)
2. Approach traps quietly (trapped animal may still be alive)
3. Dispatch humanely if alive (see below)
4. Reset or relocate trap (if no catch, try new location after 3 days)
5. Bring game bags (transport meat)

**Dispatching Live-Caught Animals:**
- **Blunt force**: Strike base of skull with heavy stick (instant death)
- **Shooting**: .22 rifle or pistol (if available, safe method)
- **Avoid**: Prolonged methods (slow death is unethical)

### Trap Maintenance

**After Each Catch:**
- Clean trap (blood, hair)
- Re-boil or smoke (remove new scent)
- Inspect for damage (bent springs, rust)
- Oil moving parts (light coating prevents rust)

**End of Season (or Move):**
- Collect all traps (leave no trace)
- Store dry (prevent rust)
- Record successful locations (map, notes)

---

## 🗺️ Trapline Management

**What Is a Trapline?**
- Series of 10-20+ traps along route (loop back to camp)
- Designed for efficient checking (1-3 hour walk)
- Targets multiple species and locations

**Layout Strategy:**
1. **Scout first**: Find game trails, burrows, feeding areas (1-2 days)
2. **Mark locations**: Flagging tape, GPS waypoints
3. **Set traps**: Place at marked spots
4. **Create walking route**: Logical path connecting traps (loop preferred)
5. **Check daily**: Same time each day (morning ideal)

**Trapline Efficiency:**
- 10 traps checked daily = 1 catch every 2-3 days (average)
- 20 traps = 1 catch per day (average)
- Success rate varies by season, location, bait quality

---

## ⚖️ Ethics & Regulations

### Ethical Trapping Principles

**1. Quick Kill or Secure Hold:**
- Deadfall/Conibear: Death within 1-2 minutes
- Snare: Death within 3-5 minutes (spring snare lifts, strangles)
- Leg-hold: If used, check every 8-12 hours (not 24)

**2. Target Species Only:**
- Use appropriate trap size (don't catch non-target animals)
- Place away from domestic animal areas (dogs, cats)

**3. No Waste:**
- Use all edible meat
- Use hide, sinew, bone if possible
- Bury or compost remains (return nutrients)

**4. Minimize Suffering:**
- Check traps consistently
- Dispatch quickly if animal is alive
- Don't set traps if you can't maintain them

### Legal Considerations

**Trapping Regulations (Vary by Location):**
- **License required**: Most US states, Canadian provinces
- **Season restrictions**: Often winter only (fur-bearing animals)
- **Trap type restrictions**: Some areas ban snares, leg-holds
- **Species restrictions**: Protected species off-limits
- **Checking frequency**: 24-48 hour requirements

**Survival Exception (Extreme Emergency):**
- Life-or-death situations may override regulations
- Document circumstances (photos, journal)
- Contact authorities when rescued (explain actions)

**Bottom Line**: Know the law before setting traps. Poaching charges are serious.

**Final Thought**: Trapping is not glamorous, but it's one of the most efficient survival skills. While you're building shelter, purifying water, or resting, your traps are working. 

**Master the basics first** (simple deadfalls, basic snares). **Then advance to Paiutes and Conibears** when you're confident. 

**Always check daily. Always dispatch quickly. Always use what you catch.**

The animal gave its life. Honor that.
