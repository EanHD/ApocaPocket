summary: Hickory nuts (Carya species) are rich, oily nuts similar to pecans (pecan is a hickory species). Shagbark and shellbark hickory are best. Sweet, high in fat and calories. No processing needed (no
  tannins). Hard to crack but worth the effort.
warnings:
- Shells are extremely hard - requires heavy rock or vice to crack
- Nut meats are small and difficult to extract - labor-intensive
- Hickory nuts can be confused with toxic buckeyes (check tree identification carefully)
- Nuts go rancid quickly if stored in warm conditions - refrigerate or freeze
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Tall trees, compound leaves (5-9 leaflets). Bark is shaggy/peeling on shagbark hickory. Nuts have thick green husk that splits into 4 sections when ripe. Inner nut has hard shell. Eastern
  North America forests.'
- 'HARVEST: Fall (Sept-Nov). Collect nuts from ground after they drop. Remove green husk (wear gloves - stains hands). Good nuts are heavy and rattle when shaken (kernel inside).'
- 'CRACKING: Place nut on solid surface, hit with heavy rock or hammer. Or use vise. Shell is very hard. Extract nut meat with pick or knife. Expect 20-40% kernel yield by weight (better than acorns, worse
  than pecans).'
- 'USES: Eat raw (sweet, rich, buttery). Roast for enhanced flavor. Add to baking, granola, pemmican. Press for hickory oil (labor-intensive).'
- 'NUTRITION: Extremely high in fat (60-70%), high calories (190 cal/oz), moderate protein. One of the richest wild foods. Excellent for winter storage and high-energy needs.'
