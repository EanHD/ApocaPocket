| Rose hips | All | Aug-Oct | Fruit | 150-200 | High Vitamin C, tea | l1-wild-fruits.md |

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - Wild Potato Seeds (Hedysarum alpinum):**
- **SEEDS ARE DEADLY** (contain ODAP toxin - neurotoxin)
- Causes lathyrism (paralysis, death)
- **Chris McCandless (Into the Wild) died from this** (1992, Alaska)
- **ONLY eat ROOTS** (tubers, not seeds)
- Positive identification critical (vs similar toxic plants)
- **When harvesting:** Dig roots BEFORE plant goes to seed (July-August)

---

### Seasonal Foraging Strategy

**Spring (May-June) - MINIMAL**
- Spruce tips (new growth, Vitamin C)
- Dandelion greens (as snow melts)
- Willow inner bark (emergency)
- **Reality:** Not much available (just emerging from snow)

**Summer (June-August) - HARVEST WINDOW**
- **Berry picking (CRITICAL):** Blueberry, salmonberry, crowberry (dry for winter)
  - Peak: July-August
  - Must harvest aggressively (short season, bears compete)
- Wild potato roots (before seeds form - SEEDS DEADLY)
- Fireweed shoots
- **This is IT:** 2-3 months to collect year's plant foods

**Fall (September-October)**
- Late berries: Cranberry, rose hips (after frost, sweeter)
- Last chance foraging before freeze
- **Wind closes:** Snow arrives, foraging over

**Winter (November-April) - NONE**
- Everything frozen, buried under snow
- **No foraging possible**
- Rely 100% on stored foods (berries, dried meat, fish)
- Willow/spruce bark (emergency, low nutrition)

**Spring (April-May) - STARVATION TIME**
- Stored foods depleted (6 months into winter)
- New growth not yet available
- **"Rabbit starvation" risk:** Lean game meat only (no fat, no carbs)
- Historically most dangerous time (pre-contact Native Alaskans)

---

### Toxic Plants

**Baneberry (Red/White):**
- Berries look edible - DEADLY (cardiac arrest)
- Causes rapid heart rate, dizziness, death

**Water Hemlock:**
- Most poisonous plant in North America
- Resembles wild carrot - DEADLY (seizures, death)

**Death Camas:**
- Looks like wild onion (but no onion smell) - TOXIC

**False Hellebore:**
- Large leaves, early spring - TOXIC (vomiting, heart issues)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Wild potato identification (root vs seed), berry identification chart, toxic plant comparisons.

## Key Animal Resources

### Large Game

| Animal | Weight | Season | Habitat | Hunting Notes | Yield (lbs meat) |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Moose | 800-1600 lbs | Sep-Oct | Taiga, willow thickets, wetlands | Largest game, one moose = 6+ months meat | 400-800 |
| Caribou | 300-600 lbs | Aug-Sep | Tundra, taiga (migrating herds) | Migrating (must intercept), excellent meat | 150-300 |
| Brown/Grizzly bear | 400-1000 lbs | Sep-Oct | All regions | DANGEROUS, fat harvest (fall), excellent meat | 200-500 |
| Black bear | 150-400 lbs | Sep-Oct | Taiga, coastal | Less common than brown bears | 75-200 |
| Dall sheep | 150-200 lbs | Aug-Sep (limited) | Mountain ranges | Challenging hunt (high altitude) | 60-80 |

**Moose:** PRIMARY GAME
- One moose = 500-800 lbs meat (feeds family for 6-12 months)
- Rutting (September-October) = bulls vocal, easier to locate
- Requires: Boat/raft for river crossings, pack frame or sled (massive load)
- **All parts used:** Meat, hide (clothing, shelter), sinew (cordage), bones (tools), antlers (tools)

**Caribou:**
- Herding (10,000+ animals possible in migration)
- Spring migration (north), fall migration (south)
- Must intercept migration path (timing critical)
- Traditionally most important game for Interior/Arctic peoples

---

### Fish (CRITICAL Alaska Resource)

**Salmon Runs (June-September) - PRIMARY FOOD SOURCE:**
| Species | Size | Peak Run | Habitat | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| King (Chinook) | 10-50 lbs | Jun-Jul | Large rivers | Biggest, fattiest, best eating |
| Sockeye (Red) | 5-8 lbs | Jul-Aug | Rivers connecting lakes | Best for smoking/drying |
| Coho (Silver) | 8-12 lbs | Aug-Sep | Coastal streams | Good fat content |
| Pink (Humpy) | 3-5 lbs | Jul-Aug (odd years stronger) | Coastal, small streams | Lean, best fresh |
| Chum (Dog) | 8-15 lbs | Jul-Sep | Coastal, rivers | Leanest, traditional dog food, good dried |

**Salmon Survival Strategy:**
- **ONE WEEK of fishing = entire winter's protein** (if preserved correctly)
- Catch: Seine nets, fish wheels, spears, hooks
- Preserve: Smoke, dry (into "strips"), salt, ferment (traditional)
- **Native Alaskan model:** Salmon = 50-80% of calories historically

**Other Fish:**
- **Grayling:** Streams, lakes (Jun-Sep), 8-14 inches, excellent eating
- **Arctic char:** Coastal rivers (Aug-Sep), 2-8 lbs, salmonid
- **Halibut:** Coastal ocean (summer), 10-100+ lbs, bottom-feeder, massive yield
- **Cod (Pacific):** Coastal (year-round), 5-20 lbs

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Salmon species identification chart, traditional fish drying rack design, Alaska salmon run timing by region.

---

### Small Game & Birds
- **Ptarmigan (willow, rock):** Tundra/taiga, year-round, 1-2 lbs, camouflage (white in winter)
- **Grouse (spruce, ruffed):** Taiga, year-round, 1-2 lbs, freeze-tolerant
- **Snowshoe hare:** Taiga, year-round (population cycles), 2-4 lbs, white in winter
- **Porcupine:** Taiga, year-round, slow-moving (easy), 10-20 lbs
- **Duck/waterfowl:** Coastal, wetlands (summer only, migrate south), decoy hunting
- **Arctic ground squirrel:** Tundra (hibernates Oct-Apr), burrows, 1-2 lbs (Native food)

---

### Marine Resources (Coastal)

**Shellfish (Tidal Zones):**
- **Mussels:** Blue mussel, abundant, intertidal rocks
- **Clams:** Razor clam, littleneck, butter clam (dig at low tide)
- **Sea urchins:** Rocky intertidal, roe edible
- **Crabs:** Dungeness, king crab (traps, pots)

**⚠️ RED TIDE WARNING:**
- Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) - DEADLY
- Caused by toxic algae bloom
- Shellfish filter toxin (accumulate in meat)
- No way to detect (colorless, tasteless, not destroyed by cooking)
- Causes paralysis, death (respiratory failure)
- **Check with locals / Alaska Dept. Environmental Conservation before eating**

**Seaweed (Coastal):**
- Bull kelp, sea lettuce, nori (edible species)
- High in minerals, vitamins
- Dry for storage (traditional food)

---

### Dangerous Animals (see l2-regional-alaska-hazards.md)
- **Brown/Grizzly bears:** Largest in world (Kodiak), AGGRESSIVE, attacks common
- **Moose:** AGGRESSIVE (rut Sep-Oct, cows with calves May-Jul), vehicle collisions deadly
- **Wolves:** Pack predators (rare attacks, but present)
- **Wolverines:** Fearless, aggressive (avoid)
- **Cold:** Equipment-destroying temperatures (-40°F+)

---

## Water Sources & Purification

### Water Availability (Season-Dependent)

**Summer (June-August):**
- **Abundant:** Rivers, streams, lakes, tundra ponds
- **Quality:** Generally excellent (cold, northern)
- **Concern:** Giardia (from animals), glacial silt (turbid)
- **Coastal:** Freshwater streams (avoid salt water)

**Fall (September-October):**
- Abundant, temperatures dropping (ice forming)
- Water sources beginning to freeze

**Winter (November-April):**
- **ALL surface water frozen** (2-8 feet ice thickness)
- Rivers: Flow under ice (dangerous to access, thin ice zones)
- Must melt ice/snow (10:1 ratio, fuel-intensive)
- **Extreme energy cost:** Melting at -40°F = massive fuel requirement

**Spring (May-June):**
- Snowmelt runoff (maximum flow)
- Rivers flood (dangerous)
- Tundra ponds thaw (but cold, clean)

---

### Winter Water Access (Critical Survival Skill)

**Method 1: Melt Ice (from lake/river)**
- Chop/saw ice blocks (clearer ice = more water, less air)
- Bring indoors, melt slowly (fuel-saving)
- 10:1 ratio (10 lbs ice = 1 lb water, minus air pockets)
- **NEVER eat ice directly** (hypothermia, energy loss)

**Method 2: Melt Snow**
- Pack snow tightly (fluffy snow = 20:1 ratio, horrible)
- Melt slowly (don't scorch pot)
- Add small amount of water first (prevents burning pot bottom)
- **Compacted snow or névé (granular snow) = better efficiency**

**Fuel Requirements (Winter):**
- Melting water = 30-50% of daily fuel consumption
- Prioritize fuel conservation (critical survival resource)
- Insulate pots (reduces heat loss during melting)

---

### Purification
**Priority:**
1. **Boil:** 1 minute (reliable, kills everything)
2. **Filter:** 0.2-micron (but some filters freeze/crack in extreme cold)
3. **Chemical:** Iodine/chlorine (slow in cold water, 60+ min wait)

**Cold Water Challenge:**
- Chemical treatments slow dramatically in near-freezing water
- Filters can freeze and crack (store in clothing/sleeping bag)
- Boiling most reliable (but fuel-intensive)

**Giardia:** Present in Alaska (beaver fever), but risk lower than lower 48

**Glacial Silt:**
- Milky-white glacial meltwater (fine rock particles)
- Let settle overnight (particles sink)
- Pour off clear water (or pre-filter)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Ice vs snow melting efficiency chart, winter water access methods illustration.

---

## Shelter Construction

### Permafrost Challenge
**Permafrost:** Ground frozen year-round (starts 6 inches to 3 feet below surface)
- **Building challenge:** Can't dig foundations (solid ice)
- **Heat challenge:** Structure heat melts permafrost = structure sinks
- **Solution:** Build on pilings/posts (air gap between ground and floor)

---

### Shelter Types by Region & Season

#### Taiga Cabin (Long-term, Interior)
```
Design: Log structure on pilings, extreme insulation
- Foundation: Posts/pilings on permafrost (air gap prevents melting)
- Walls: 12-18 inch diameter spruce logs (abundant), chinked with moss/mud
- Insulation: R-60+ (double walls, packed with moss/grass/animal hide)
- Roof: Steep pitch (shed snow), support 6-8 ft snow load
- Size: SMALL (10x12 ft max for 1-2 people - easier to heat)
- Heat: Wood stove (CRITICAL - life depends on it)
- Chimney: Insulated (prevent creosote in extreme cold)
- Door: Double-door entry (airlock reduces heat loss)
- Windows: TINY (south-facing only, triple-pane if possible, shuttered at night)
- Sod roof: Traditional (extra insulation, holds snow)
```

**Firewood Requirement:** 8-12 cords per winter (6+ months, -40°F+)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Alaska cabin on pilings (permafrost solution), sod roof cross-section, extreme insulation techniques.

---

#### Tundra Emergency Shelter (NO TREES)

**Snow Cave/Quinzee (Winter Only):**
```
- Pile snow into dome (8-10 ft high, 10-12 ft diameter)
- Wait 2-4 hours (snow hardens, sintering)
- Excavate interior (18-24 inch walls - thicker in extreme cold)
- Ventilation hole in roof (CRITICAL)
- Entrance below sleeping platform
- Interior temp: 0-20°F (vs -40°F outside)
- Blocks wind (main killer)
```

**Sod House (Summer Construction, for Winter):**
```
- Cut sod blocks (tundra vegetation + roots = cohesive)
- Stack like bricks (2-3 ft thick walls)
- Driftwood or whale bone frame (coastal - no trees on tundra)
- Earth/sod roof
- Interior: Raised sleeping platform, oil lamp (seal oil traditionally)
- Used by Inuit historically
```

---

#### Coastal Shelter (Southeast)

```
Design: Log cabin, but focused on WATER RESISTANCE
- Walls: Cedar, spruce (rot-resistant)
- Roof: Steep pitch (heavy rain), cedar shakes or modern roofing
- Insulation: R-40 (not as extreme as Interior, but needed)
- Elevated: Above high tide line, flood zone
- Ventilation: CRITICAL (humidity, prevent mold)
- Heat: Wood stove (wet wood challenge - require covered wood storage)
```

**Challenge:** Perpetual wet (everything mildews, rots)

---

### Insulation Materials (Region-Specific)

**Interior/Taiga:**
1. **Dry moss (sphagnum):** R-1 per inch, abundant, harvests easily
2. **Dry grass/sedge:** R-1.5 per inch, tundra/meadows
3. **Spruce boughs:** R-0.5 per inch, aromatic, layers
4. **Animal hides:** R-2-3 per inch (caribou, moose - traditional)
5. **Snow:** R-1 per inch (packed on roof, yes, snow insulates)

**Tundra:**
1. **Sod/moss:** Only option (no trees)
2. **Animal skins:** Caribou (hollow hair = insulation), seal, polar bear (coastal)
3. **Snow:** Primary winter insulation

**Critical:** At -40°F+, need R-60+ to survive (3-4x normal home insulation)

---

## Fire Making & Management

### Firewood (Taiga Only - Tundra has NO TREES)

| Wood Type | Region | BTU/cord | Burn Rate | Availability | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| White spruce | Interior | 15-17M | Fast | Very common | Taiga staple, resinous |
| Black spruce | Interior | 14-16M | Fast | Very common (muskeg) | Small, crooked, harder to harvest |
| Birch (paper, Alaska) | Interior | 20-24M | Moderate | Common | Best heating wood, but rots fast if dead |
| Alder | Coastal, rivers | 17-19M | Moderate | Common near water | Good coals, smoky |
| Cottonwood | Rivers | 13-15M | Fast | Common | Easy to split, low BTU |

**Best:** Birch (highest BTU in Alaska)  
**Reality:** Spruce (most abundant, survives to treeline)

---

### Extreme Cold Fire Challenges

**At -40°F:**
- Metal axe handles shatter (switch to hardwood handles)
- Chainsaw won't start (fuel gels, oil thickens)
- Hands freeze in minutes (can't work without gloves, but gloves = clumsiness)
- Fire required to warm tools to use tools (Catch-22)

**Solutions:**
- Pre-cut firewood in fall (before extreme cold)
- Store wood indoors (bring in 2-4 weeks supply)
- Keep tools inside (near stove, ready to use)

---

### Firewood Requirements (Interior Winter)

**Consumption:** 1-1.5 cords per month (November-April = 6-9 cords)

**Daily Routine (-40°F):**
```
Midnight-6 AM: Fire burns down (wake every 2-3 hours to reload, or accept cold)
6 AM: Revive coals (critical moment - if fire out, survival emergency)
7 AM-11 PM: Load stove every 3-4 hours (constant vigilance)
11 PM: Bank fire (largest splits, damper down, pray it lasts)
```

**Reality:** Fire maintenance is 24/7 job in extreme cold

**If Fire Goes Out at -40°F:**
- Interior temp drops to -20°F within hours
- Extreme difficulty restarting (cold hands, cold tools)
- **Life-threatening emergency**

---

### Fire Starting (Extreme Cold)

**Tinder (Cold-Resistant):**
1. **Birch bark:** Best (starts even when wet, frozen)
2. **Spruce resin/pitch:** Excellent (scrape from trees, carries with fire-starting kit)
3. **Dry spruce needles:** Under trees, protected from snow
4. **Cotton balls + petroleum jelly:** Modern (carry in kit, burns 5+ minutes)
5. **Fatwood:** Resin-rich pine stumps (less common in Alaska spruce forests)

**Challenges:**
- Hands freeze in seconds (hard to use lighter/matches)
- Metal lighters fail (fuel too cold)
- Matches brittle (snap easily)
- Wood frozen solid (hard to split kindling)

**Solutions:**
- Keep fire starter kit in clothing (body heat)
- Rig Lighter (windproof, works to -40°F)
- Ferrocerium rod (works at any temperature)
- Pre-split kindling (stored indoors, brought out when needed)

---

### Alternative Heat (Tundra - NO WOOD)

**Traditional Inuit/Native Methods:**
1. **Seal oil lamp (qulliq):**
   - Burns seal/whale blubber (rendered fat)
   - Soapstone lamp, moss wick
   - Provides heat, light, cooking
   - Can keep shelter above freezing
2. **Animal fat candles:**
   - Rendered caribou, bear fat
   - Slow burn
3. **Driftwood:**
   - Coastal tundra (ocean brings wood from Siberia, Alaska rivers)
   - Collect in summer, store for winter
4. **Peat/tundra sod:**
   - Burns slowly (like coal)
   - Smoky, low heat, but better than nothing
5. **Willow (dwarf):**
   - Grows along streams (even on tundra)
   - Small, but usable for cooking fire

**Modern (If Available):**
- Kerosene heaters (fuel must be flown in - expensive, logistically challenging)
- Propane (same issue)
- **Reality for survival:** Must hunt marine mammals for blubber (if coastal tundra)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Traditional qulliq (seal oil lamp) design, birch bark fire starting technique, extreme cold fire-starting kit contents.

## Seasonal Survival Strategies

### Summer (June-August) - SHORT, CRITICAL WINDOW

**Advantages:**
- **20-24 hours daylight** (Interior/Arctic - never dark)
- Temperatures mild (50-75°F)
- **Salmon runs** (Jun-Sep - entire winter's protein)
- **Berry harvest** (Jul-Aug - preserve for winter)
- Ice-free (boat/raft travel possible)
- Wildlife abundant (moose, caribou, bears fattening)
- Building season (only time to construct)

**Challenges:**
- **Mosquitoes:** BIBLICAL PLAGUE (clouds of millions, drive humans insane)
  - Peak: June-July
  - Density: 50-100 bites per minute in still air (unprotected)
  - Solution: Netting, DEET, smoke, wind (hilltops), accept suffering
- **No darkness:** Sleep disruption (melatonin production affected)
- **Short season:** 10-12 weeks total (lower than lower 48)

**Priorities (EVERYTHING happens in summer):**
1. **SALMON FISHING (CRITICAL):** One week = entire winter's protein
   - Catch: Hundreds of fish (if on good stream)
   - Preserve: Smoke, dry (strips), salt (if available)
2. **Berry harvest:** Dry for winter (blueberry, salmonberry, cranberry)
3. **Firewood:** Cut/split/stack 8-12 cords (before ground freezes)
4. **Build/repair shelter:** Before snow (September)
5. **Hunt:** Moose, caribou (early season, cache meat)
6. **Gather insulation:** Moss, grasses (must dry before winter)

**Rule:** "You only get one summer. If you screw up, winter kills you."

---

### Fall (September-October) - PREPARATION DEADLINE

**Advantages:**
- **Hunting season:** Moose, caribou (rut, easier to locate)
- Cooler (50-60°F, mosquitoes gone)
- Clear weather (beautiful)
- Late berries (cranberry, rose hips)

**Challenges:**
- **First snow:** Can hit ANYTIME (September blizzards common)
- **Freeze-up:** Rivers ice over (boat travel ends)
- Rapidly shortening days (14 → 8 hours)
- **Deadline pressure:** If not ready by November, you're dead

**Priorities:**
1. **Final hunting:** Moose = 6-12 months meat (one animal = survival)
2. **Complete firewood:** 8-12 cords minimum (stack, cover, near shelter)
3. **Shelter winterization:**
   - Final insulation (R-60+)
   - Chink all gaps (moss, mud, modern caulk)
   - Test wood stove, chimney (clean creosote)
   - Storm supplies (food, fuel, water access plan)
4. **Fat harvest:** Bears fattening (render fat = cooking oil, calories, lamp fuel)
5. **Cache meat:** Dig permafrost cache (natural freezer)
6. **Mental preparation:** 6+ months of darkness, isolation coming

**Rule:** "First snow is a warning. By Halloween, you're locked in."

---

### Winter (November-April) - SURVIVAL MODE

**Challenges:**
- **EXTREME COLD:** -40°F to -60°F (Interior), -30°F to -50°F (Arctic)
- **DARKNESS:** 3-5 hours daylight (Interior), 0 hours (Arctic - 2 months polar night)
- **Total isolation:** No travel (whiteout, cold, mechanical failure)
- **Equipment failure:** -40°F = batteries die, metal shatters, fuel gels, skin freezes
- **Psychological:** Darkness, isolation, boredom (cabin fever, depression)

**Priorities:**
1. **FIRE MAINTENANCE:** 24/7 vigilance (life depends on it)
   - Reload stove every 3-4 hours (around the clock)
   - Never let fire die completely
   - Keep 2+ weeks firewood INDOORS (can't fetch from outdoor pile in -50°F)
2. **Water:** Melt ice/snow (daily chore, fuel-intensive)
3. **Food rationing:** Make stored fish/meat/berries last 6 months
4. **Mental health:** Darkness (SAD lamps if available), routine, purpose
5. **Conserve energy:** Minimize outdoor exposure (frostbite in minutes)
6. **Emergency prep:** Have backup heat source, extra food (in case longer winter)

**Daily Routine:**
```
8 AM (still dark): Stoke fire, melt ice for water, eat
10 AM (gray light): Equipment maintenance indoors, fire reload
12 PM: Meal, fire reload
2 PM (already getting dark): Ice fishing nearby (if possible), fire reload
4 PM (dark): Inside for night, fire reload
6 PM: Meal, fire reload
9 PM: Banking fire, bed (wake every 2-3 hours to reload)
```

**Survival Rules:**
- **NEVER go outside in blizzard** (whiteout, disorientation, freeze in minutes)
- Stay dry (wet = death)
- Ration food (April is 5-6 months away)
- Don't overexert (sweating = hypothermia)
- **Keep fire burning** (if it dies, may not restart)
- **Acceptance:** You're not going anywhere until May

**Expected:** Lose 15-30 lbs (calorie deficit common), Vitamin D deficiency, mild depression

### Spring (April-May) - SLOW THAW

**Advantages:**
- Days lengthening (8 → 20 hours)
- Temperatures rising (-20°F → 40°F)
- **END OF ISOLATION** (rivers thaw, travel possible by June)
- First migrating birds (ptarmigan, waterfowl return)
- **Psychological relief:** Survived winter

**Challenges:**
- **STARVATION TIME:** 6 months into winter, stored food depleted
- No new food yet (plants not emerged, salmon not running)
- "Breakup" (ice on rivers breaking up - dangerous, dramatic, flood risk)
- **Rabbit starvation:** Only lean game meat available (need fat, carbs)
- Weakened (months of calorie deficit, darkness, isolation)

**Priorities:**
- Repair shelter from winter (snow damage, roof)
- Restock firewood (while still cold, before summer bugs)
- First fishing (grayling, char in streams)
- Wait for salmon runs (June)
- First greens (dandelion, spruce tips)
- **Mental recovery:** Sunlight, activity, hope

**Rule:** "Spring is just 'winter-lite' until the salmon come back."

## Regional Hazards Summary

**Primary Killers:**
1. **Hypothermia/cold exposure:** -40°F to -60°F, equipment failure, frostbite in minutes
2. **Brown/Grizzly bear attacks:** Largest, most aggressive bears in world
3. **Moose aggression:** More injuries than bears (rut, cows with calves)
4. **Isolation:** Injuries/illness with no help (days to weeks to rescue)
5. **River drownings:** Cold water (40-50°F), swift current, glacial melt
6. **Avalanches:** Mountain regions (similar to Rockies)
7. **Starvation:** Failed hunting/fishing = no food for 6+ months

**See l2-regional-alaska-hazards.md for detailed hazard protocols.**
