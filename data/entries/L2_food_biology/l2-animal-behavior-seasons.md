summary: Understanding seasonal animal behavior cycles improves foraging success and
  safety. Animals are most active and predictable during feeding, breeding, and migration
  periods.
steps:
- "Spring: breeding season \u2014 males territorial and visible. Nesting birds aggressive.\
  \ Fish spawning in shallows."
- 'Summer: dispersed feeding. Dawn/dusk activity peaks. Water sources become gathering
  points.'
- "Fall: migration and fat-building. Best hunting season \u2014 animals are heaviest.\
  \ Salmon runs. Nut/fruit competition."
- 'Winter: reduced activity, concentrated near food/shelter. Tracking easiest in snow.
  Hibernators unavailable.'
warnings:
- Breeding animals (especially bears, moose, elk) are more aggressive.
- Avoid disturbing nesting sites.
- Predator activity increases near concentrated prey.

## Overview
Understanding seasonal animal behavior cycles improves foraging success and safety. Animals are most active and predictable during feeding, breeding, and migration periods.

## Step-by-step
1. Spring: breeding season — males territorial and visible. Nesting birds aggressive. Fish spawning in shallows.
2. Summer: dispersed feeding. Dawn/dusk activity peaks. Water sources become gathering points.
3. Fall: migration and fat-building. Best hunting season — animals are heaviest. Salmon runs. Nut/fruit competition.
4. Winter: reduced activity, concentrated near food/shelter. Tracking easiest in snow. Hibernators unavailable.

## Warnings
- Breeding animals (especially bears, moose, elk) are more aggressive.
- Avoid disturbing nesting sites.
- Predator activity increases near concentrated prey.
