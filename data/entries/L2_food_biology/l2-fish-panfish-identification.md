summary: Panfish (bluegill, sunfish, crappie) are small fish (4-10 inches) that are easy to catch in ponds and lakes. Abundant, bite readily, good eating. Small but numerous - catch dozens for a meal.
warnings:
- Small size means more work per pound of meat - but easy to catch in quantity
- Bony - eat carefully or pressure-cook to soften bones
- Panfish from warm stagnant water can taste muddy
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Small, flat-bodied fish. BLUEGILL: dark blue/black spot on gill cover, vertical bars on side, 6-10 inches. CRAPPIE: speckled pattern, paper-thin mouth, 8-12 inches. HABITAT: ponds, lakes,
  slow rivers. Near vegetation.'
- 'FIELD DRESSING: Gut and scale (small scales come off easily). Or fillet. Very little meat per fish.'
- 'COOKING: (1) Whole: gut, scale, fry in pan (eat around bones). (2) Fillet: small fillets, bread and fry. (3) Pressure cook: cooks bones soft, can eat entire fish. Mild, sweet flavor.'
- 'STRATEGY: Catch many small panfish rather than a few large fish - easier in survival scenario.'
