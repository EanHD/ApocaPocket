summary: The Universal Edibility Test is a systematic 8-hour protocol for determining if an unknown plant part is safe to eat. Each body part is tested separately — leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and seeds
  may have different toxicity levels.
warnings:
- NEVER test mushrooms or fungi with this protocol — many deadly mushrooms taste pleasant and symptoms appear 6-24 hours later when liver damage is already fatal
- Test ONLY ONE plant part at a time — a plant with edible leaves may have toxic roots
- 'Skip testing if you recognize the plant as belonging to known toxic families: white/yellow berries, umbrella-shaped flower clusters (parsley family — many are deadly), milky sap (except dandelion), almond
  scent in leaves/bark'
- Do NOT eat anything during the 8-hour test period except the test plant — you need to isolate reactions
- If any reaction occurs at ANY stage, stop immediately, induce vomiting if within 30 minutes of ingestion, and drink plenty of water
steps:
- 'PREPARATION (Hour 0): Fast for 8 hours before starting the test. Separate the plant into parts: leaves, stems, roots, flowers, seeds, bark. You will test each part individually. Start with the part that
  is most abundant.'
- 'CONTACT TEST (Hour 0, 15 min): Crush the plant part and rub it on your inner wrist. Wait 15 minutes. If redness, burning, itching, or rash develops → discard this part, test a different part.'
- 'LIP TEST (Hour 0:15, 15 min): Touch the plant part to the corner of your lip. Wait 15 minutes. Watch for burning, tingling, numbness, or swelling.'
- 'TONGUE TEST (Hour 0:30, 15 min): Place a small piece on your tongue. Do NOT chew. Hold for 15 minutes. If burning, extreme bitterness, soapy taste, or numbing → spit out, rinse mouth, abandon this part.'
- 'CHEW TEST (Hour 0:45, 15 min): Chew a small piece thoroughly but do NOT swallow. Hold the chewed material in your mouth for 15 minutes. Same reaction criteria as above.'
- 'SWALLOW TEST (Hour 1): Swallow the small chewed portion. Wait 8 HOURS. Eat nothing else. Monitor for nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, dizziness, or any abnormal symptoms.'
- 'SMALL MEAL TEST (Hour 9): If no reaction after 8 hours, eat a small handful (¼ cup) of the prepared plant part. Wait another 8 hours monitoring for symptoms.'
- 'SAFE TO EAT (Hour 17+): If no reaction after the small meal, this specific plant part, prepared this specific way, is likely safe to eat. Cooked and raw may differ in toxicity — test each preparation
  method separately.'
- 'IMPORTANT: many toxic plants cause DELAYED symptoms (6-48 hours). The 8-hour waits are minimum — longer is safer. Keep a written log of what you tested and results.'
- 'SHORTCUT PLANTS (skip test — globally recognized as safe): dandelion (all parts), cattail (all parts), clover, wood sorrel, plantain broadleaf, chickweed. Learning to identify these 6 plants is more
  valuable than the edibility test.'
