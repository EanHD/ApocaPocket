summary: Agave heart (piña) was roasted in earth ovens for 1-3 days by indigenous peoples. Sweet and calorie-dense when cooked. Labor-intensive but high-yield. Many species are edible.
warnings:
- Raw agave is inedible and toxic
- Requires 1-3 days of pit-roasting or equivalent
- Leaf edges have sharp spines
- Sap can irritate skin
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Rosette of thick fleshy leaves with sharp spines. Tall flower stalk appears once (10-30 years), then plant dies. Common in deserts.'
- 'HARVEST: Best to harvest just before flowering (piña is largest and sweetest). Cut leaves away, dig up piña (heart/base of plant). Piña weighs 10-50 lbs.'
- 'TRADITIONAL ROASTING: Dig earth oven (pit with hot rocks). Roast piña for 1-3 days (slow cooking converts inulin to sugars). Result: sweet, fibrous, molasses-like.'
- 'MODERN COOKING: Wrap piña in foil, roast in coals/oven 12-24 hours at low temp (250-300F). Check for soft, sweet flesh.'
- 'USES: Eat roasted agave like artichoke (chew fibers, spit out pulp). Or mash and make syrup. High in carbs.'
