summary: A fish weir is a V-shaped or funnel-shaped stone/stick barrier built across a stream that channels fish into a holding
  pen or basket trap. Completely passive — works 24/7. One of the oldest and most effective fishing methods in human history.
steps:
- 'SITE SELECTION: Choose a shallow section of stream (30–60 cm / 12–24 inches deep) with moderate current. Ideal locations:
  where streams narrow naturally, below rapids, or where fish visibly travel.'
- 'WEIR WALLS: Build two converging walls of stacked rocks or driven stakes across the stream, forming a V-shape pointing
  downstream. Walls should extend from bank to bank. Gap between rocks/stakes must be smaller than target fish (<2.5 cm /
  1 inch for most species).'
- 'FUNNEL OPENING: The narrow end of the V should have an opening 15–30 cm (6–12 inches) wide. This opening leads into the
  trap enclosure. Fish follow the walls downstream and funnel through.'
- 'HOLDING PEN: Behind the funnel opening, build a circular or rectangular pen from rocks or stakes, approximately 1 m × 1
  m (3 × 3 ft). Walls must be high enough that fish cannot jump out (at least 30 cm / 12 inches above water level).'
- 'BASKET TRAP (alternative): Weave a conical basket from flexible green branches (willow, hazel) or split bamboo. Diameter:
  30–40 cm (12–16 inches), length: 60–90 cm (24–36 inches). Create an inward-pointing funnel entrance (fish enter but cannot
  find exit). Place basket at the V opening, mouth facing upstream.'
- 'BAIT (optional): Place bait inside the pen or basket — crushed shellfish, bread, fish guts, or bright berries. Many weirs
  work without bait as fish naturally follow current through the funnel.'
- 'MAINTENANCE: Check trap every 6–12 hours. Remove fish. Clear debris (leaves, sticks) that block flow through weir walls.
  A blocked weir causes water to flow over/around it, and fish bypass the trap.'
- 'ENHANCEMENT: Place large rocks or brush upstream of the weir to create turbulence — fish in disturbed water are less cautious
  and more likely to enter the funnel.'
warnings:
- Building a weir across a stream may be illegal outside survival situations — it blocks fish migration and alters stream
  ecology.
- Flash floods can destroy weirs and are extremely dangerous in narrow stream channels. Do not build weirs in flood-prone
  areas during rainy season.
- Weirs require significant labor to build (2–6 hours). This is an investment — best for semi-permanent camps where you will
  fish the same stream for days/weeks.
- Ensure some water still flows through the weir to maintain oxygen levels in the holding pen — trapped fish die quickly in
  stagnant warm water.
- Beware of snakes and leeches when working in shallow streams. Wear foot protection if available.

## Overview
A fish weir is a V-shaped or funnel-shaped stone/stick barrier built across a stream that channels fish into a holding pen or basket trap. Completely passive — works 24/7. One of the oldest and most effective fishing methods in human history.

## Step-by-step
1. SITE SELECTION: Choose a shallow section of stream (30–60 cm / 12–24 inches deep) with moderate current. Ideal locations: where streams narrow naturally, below rapids, or where fish visibly travel.
2. WEIR WALLS: Build two converging walls of stacked rocks or driven stakes across the stream, forming a V-shape pointing downstream. Walls should extend from bank to bank. Gap between rocks/stakes must be smaller than target fish (<2.5 cm / 1 inch for most species).
3. FUNNEL OPENING: The narrow end of the V should have an opening 15–30 cm (6–12 inches) wide. This opening leads into the trap enclosure. Fish follow the walls downstream and funnel through.
4. HOLDING PEN: Behind the funnel opening, build a circular or rectangular pen from rocks or stakes, approximately 1 m × 1 m (3 × 3 ft). Walls must be high enough that fish cannot jump out (at least 30 cm / 12 inches above water level).
5. BASKET TRAP (alternative): Weave a conical basket from flexible green branches (willow, hazel) or split bamboo. Diameter: 30–40 cm (12–16 inches), length: 60–90 cm (24–36 inches). Create an inward-pointing funnel entrance (fish enter but cannot find exit). Place basket at the V opening, mouth facing upstream.
6. BAIT (optional): Place bait inside the pen or basket — crushed shellfish, bread, fish guts, or bright berries. Many weirs work without bait as fish naturally follow current through the funnel.
7. MAINTENANCE: Check trap every 6–12 hours. Remove fish. Clear debris (leaves, sticks) that block flow through weir walls. A blocked weir causes water to flow over/around it, and fish bypass the trap.
8. ENHANCEMENT: Place large rocks or brush upstream of the weir to create turbulence — fish in disturbed water are less cautious and more likely to enter the funnel.
