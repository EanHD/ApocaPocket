## 1. HEAT STROKE & HEAT INDEX

### The Heat Index Formula
**Heat Index = Temperature + Humidity Effect**

Real temperature + Southeast humidity = dangerous combined effect.

| Temperature | 60% Humidity | 70% Humidity | 80% Humidity | 90% Humidity |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 85°F | 90°F | 93°F | 97°F | 102°F |
| 90°F | 96°F | 101°F | 108°F | 117°F |
| 95°F | 104°F | 113°F | 124°F | 144°F |
| 100°F | 114°F | 129°F | 151°F | FATAL |

**⚠️ CRITICAL THRESHOLDS:**
- **80-90°F:** Fatigue possible with prolonged exposure
- **90-105°F:** Heat cramps and exhaustion possible
- **105-130°F:** Heat exhaustion and stroke LIKELY
- **130°F+:** Heat stroke IMMINENT

### Heat Illness Progression

#### Stage 1: Heat Cramps
**Symptoms:** Muscle cramps (legs, abdomen), heavy sweating, fatigue  
**Action:** Stop activity, move to shade, drink water with salt (1/4 tsp per quart)  
**Recovery time:** 30-60 minutes

#### Stage 2: Heat Exhaustion
**Symptoms:** Heavy sweating, weakness, cold/clammy skin, nausea, dizziness, headache  
**Action:**
1. Move to shade IMMEDIATELY
2. Remove excess clothing
3. Cool with wet cloths, fanning
4. Drink water slowly (1 cup every 15 min)
5. Elevate legs
**Recovery time:** 2-4 hours
**Risk:** Progresses to heat stroke if untreated

#### Stage 3: Heat Stroke (MEDICAL EMERGENCY)
**Symptoms:**
- Body temp 103°F+
- Hot, DRY skin (sweating stopped) OR still sweating in some cases
- Confusion, altered mental state
- Slurred speech
- Loss of consciousness
- Seizures

**Action (LIFE-THREATENING):**
1. Call for help if possible
2. Move to shade IMMEDIATELY
3. Remove clothing
4. Cool AGGRESSIVELY:
   - Immerse in cold water if available
   - Wet skin and fan continuously
   - Ice packs on neck, armpits, groin
5. DO NOT give fluids if unconscious (choking risk)
6. Monitor breathing

**Timeline:** Brain damage begins at 15-20 minutes, death possible within 1 hour

### Prevention Strategies

**Daily Schedule (Summer):**
```
Dawn-10 AM: Work period (coolest hours)
10 AM-4 PM: REST in shade, minimal activity
4 PM-Dusk: Work period (cooling hours)
Night: Sleep in ventilated shelter
```

**Hydration Protocol:**
- Drink BEFORE thirsty (thirst = already dehydrated)
- 1 gallon minimum per day (more if working)
- Urine color = hydration indicator:
  - Clear/pale yellow = good
  - Dark yellow = dehydrated
  - Brown/orange = DANGEROUSLY dehydrated
- Add salt to water (1/4 tsp per quart) if sweating heavily

**Clothing:**
- Light colors (reflects heat)
- Loose fit (airflow)
- Wide-brim hat (shades face, neck)
- Long sleeves if sun exposure (counterintuitive but prevents radiant heat)
- Cotton OK in Southeast (evaporative cooling from sweat)

**Shelter:**
- Elevated (cooler air flows under)
- Open sides (cross-breeze)
- Shade (double-layer roof if possible - air gap)
- Near water (not IN swamp - mosquitoes)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Heat index danger zones chart, cooling technique illustrations, hydration schedule timeline.

## 2. HURRICANES

### Hurricane Threat Window
**Official Season:** June 1 - November 30  
**Peak Period:** August 15 - October 15 (70% of major hurricanes)  
**Highest Risk States:** Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina (in order)

### Saffir-Simpson Scale

| Category | Wind Speed | Storm Surge | Damage Potential | Survival Strategy |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 74-95 mph | 4-5 ft | Minor structure damage | Shelter in place (inland) |
| 2 | 96-110 mph | 6-8 ft | Moderate damage, power out days | Shelter in place (inland) |
| 3 | 111-129 mph | 9-12 ft | Major damage, power out weeks | EVACUATE (coastal) |
| 4 | 130-156 mph | 13-18 ft | Catastrophic, uninhabitable weeks | EVACUATE |
| 5 | 157+ mph | 18+ ft | Total destruction | EVACUATE |

**⚠️ STORM SURGE IS THE #1 KILLER:** 90% of hurricane deaths are from water, not wind.

### Hurricane Zones & Evacuation

**Coastal Zones (0-20 miles inland):**
- **Cat 1-2:** Shelter in place if structure is solid, elevated, away from large trees
- **Cat 3+:** EVACUATE INLAND (40+ miles, or to designated shelter)
- **Storm surge:** Can push 10-20 miles inland in flat coastal plains

**Inland Zones (20-100 miles):**
- **Cat 1-3:** Shelter in place with proper structure
- **Cat 4-5:** Risk from wind, tornadoes; sturdy shelter required

**Mountain Foothills (100+ miles, elevated):**
- Wind weakens rapidly
- Flooding from rain becomes primary threat (20-30 inches possible)

### Hurricane Survival Protocol

#### 72 Hours Before (Hurricane Watch)
- Monitor NOAA Weather Radio / NWS updates
- Check evacuation routes
- Prepare shelter reinforcements
- Collect water (1 gal/person/day x 7 days minimum)
- Cook food in advance (no fire possible during storm)
- Secure loose items (become projectiles in wind)

#### 24 Hours Before (Hurricane Warning)
- **EVACUATE if coastal + Cat 3+** (last chance)
- If sheltering: Final preparations
  - Board windows or move inside away from glass
  - Fill bathtubs with water (backup supply)
  - Charge devices (power will fail)
  - Move to interior room on lowest floor
- Identify shelter location:
  - Central interior room (bathroom, closet)
  - Ground floor (NOT basement in coastal areas - flooding)
  - Away from windows and doors
  - Under sturdy structure (avoid mobile homes)

#### During Hurricane
- Stay in shelter location
- Do NOT go outside during eye (calm period - winds return)
- Monitor weather radio for updates
- Avoid windows (flying debris, glass)
- If water entering structure:
  - Move to higher floor if safe
  - If flooding severe and structure failing: LAST RESORT - attic with tools to break through roof (escape route)
  - NEVER go into enclosed attic without axe/hatchet (can be trapped)

#### After Hurricane
- Wait for ALL-CLEAR from authorities
- Hazards after storm:
  - Downed power lines (assume ALL are live)
  - Structural damage (unstable buildings)
  - Flooding (contaminated water)
  - Displaced wildlife (snakes, alligators in flood water)
  - No services (power, water, roads may be out for weeks)

### Tornado Risk During Hurricanes
Hurricanes spawn tornadoes (especially in outer rain bands):
- Usually EF0-EF2 strength
- Little warning (embedded in rain)
- Move to interior room, lowest floor
- Get under sturdy furniture if possible

## 3. FLOODING

### Flash Flood Risk
**Primary Cause:** Intense thunderstorms (2-6 inches rain in 1-2 hours)  
**Peak Season:** July-September  
**Highest Risk:** Urban areas (runoff), canyons/valleys, low-lying areas

### Flood Development Timeline
```
Thunderstorm → 30-60 min → Water rises in creeks/streams → 1-2 hours → Flash flood peak → 4-8 hours → Water recedes
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:** If water is flowing across your path, DO NOT CROSS.
- **6 inches moving water:** Can knock you down
- **12 inches moving water:** Can move a car
- **2 feet moving water:** Can float most vehicles

### High-Risk Situations
1. **Dry creek beds:** Can go from dry to 10+ feet deep in 30 minutes
2. **Low-water crossings:** Flash flood deaths #1 location (never drive through)
3. **Camping in valleys:** Water funnels down - camp on high ground
4. **After heavy rain:** Ground saturation = more runoff = faster flooding

### River Flooding (Slower Development)
**Causes:** Multi-day rain, upstream rain, dam release, hurricane  
**Timeline:** 1-7 days from rain to peak flood  
**Major flood rivers:** Mississippi, Tennessee, Cumberland, Savannah

**River Flood Stages:**
- **Action Stage:** River rising, monitor conditions
- **Minor Flood:** Low-lying areas flood, some evacuations
- **Moderate Flood:** Structures threatened, roads closed
- **Major Flood:** Widespread damage, extensive evacuations

### Survival Protocol

#### Avoid Flooding
- **Shelter location:** Never camp in valley bottom, dry wash, or <10 ft above river
- **Weather monitoring:** Heavy rain upstream = flood downstream (even if sunny where you are)
- **Spring snowmelt:** Mountain rivers flood April-May from snowpack

#### During Flash Flood
1. **Get to high ground IMMEDIATELY** (climb hill, go upstairs)
2. **Abandon vehicle if water rising** (more people drown in cars than on foot)
3. **Never walk through moving water >6 inches** (you will fall)
4. **If swept away:**
   - Float on back, feet downstream
   - Angle toward shore
   - Grab stationary objects (trees, rocks)
   - AVOID strainers (trees/debris that trap you underwater)

#### After Flood
- **Water contamination:** Flood water = sewage, chemicals, bacteria (purify before drinking)
- **Structural damage:** Buildings may be unstable
- **Mold:** Develops within 24-48 hours in humid Southeast
- **Wildlife displacement:** Snakes, alligators, fire ants in unexpected places

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Flash flood depth danger indicators (6", 12", 24" with car/person scale), water crossing assessment flowchart.

- Thick body, cat-like pupils

**Habitat:** Swamps, rivers, lakes, ANY freshwater body  
**Behavior:**
- **Aggressive when threatened** (unlike most snakes)
- Will stand ground instead of fleeing
- Often swims on water surface (vs below like non-venomous)
- Active dawn/dusk/night, basks on logs during day

**Range:** Entire Southeast coastal plain, up major river systems  
**Venom:** Hemotoxic (destroys blood cells, tissue damage)  
**Lethality:** Rarely fatal (~0.01% of bites) but causes severe tissue damage

#### Copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix)
**Identification:**
- 2-3 feet long (up to 4 feet)
- Copper/tan color with hourglass-shaped darker bands
- Broad head (triangular)
- Heat-sensing pits
- Cat-like pupils

**Habitat:** Forests, rocky areas, woodpiles, leaf litter  
**Behavior:**
- **Relies on camouflage** (freezes when detected)
- Most bites occur from people stepping on/near them
- Not aggressive, prefers to hide

**Range:** Entire Southeast except southern Florida  
**Venom:** Hemotoxic (weaker than cottonmouth)  
**Lethality:** Almost never fatal, but painful and requires medical treatment

#### Rattlesnakes (Crotalus & Sistrurus species)
**Species in Southeast:**
- Timber rattlesnake (mountains, forests)
- Eastern diamondback (largest, coastal plain, FL)
- Pygmy rattlesnake (small, widespread)

- Round pupils (unique among SE venomous snakes)

**Habitat:** Pine forests, scrubland, under logs/leaf litter  
**Behavior:**
- **Reclusive, rarely seen**
- Most bites occur when handled
- Small mouth, must chew to envenomate (vs fangs on pit vipers)

**Venom:** Neurotoxic (affects nervous system, different from others)  
**Lethality:** Potentially lethal, but bites are rare (most bites have no envenomation)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Side-by-side snake identification (head shape, pattern, pupils, key features), snake habitat/encounter locations.

### Snake Bite Prevention

**When Walking:**
- Watch where you step (90% of bites are on feet/ankles/hands)
- Use walking stick to probe ahead in tall grass
- Step ON logs/rocks, not over them (snake may be on other side)
- Boots + long pants (reduces penetration depth)

**When Camping:**
- Shake out boots, clothing, sleeping bag before use
- Keep tent zipped (snakes enter seeking warmth)
- Use elevated cot/platform (off ground)
- Clear area around camp (snakes avoid open areas)

**Around Water:**
- Avoid water's edge at dawn/dusk (cottonmouth feeding time)
- Never reach into hollow logs, under rocks near water
- Look before sitting on logs/stumps near water

**Seasonal Awareness:**
- April-May: Snakes emerging from winter (sluggish, unpredictable)
- June-August: Peak activity (mating, hunting)
- September-October: Active before hibernation
- November-March: Inactive (<60°F), but can be found in warm refuges

### Snake Bite Protocol

#### Immediate Response (First 5 Minutes)
1. **Get away from snake** (avoid second strike)
2. **Stay calm** (increased heart rate = faster venom spread)
3. **Remove jewelry/tight clothing** (swelling will occur)
4. **Immobilize bitten limb** (splint if possible)
5. **Keep limb at/below heart level**

#### DO NOT:
- ❌ Apply tourniquet (causes tissue death)
- ❌ Cut wound and suck venom (ineffective, increases infection risk)
- ❌ Apply ice (increases tissue damage)
- ❌ Give alcohol/drugs (affects blood pressure)
- ❌ Try to catch/kill snake (risk second bite)

#### Transport (If Possible)
- Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY
- Antivenom available at hospitals (most effective <6 hours)
- Time = tissue: Faster treatment = less damage

#### Survival Without Medical Care (Worst Case)
**Hemotoxic (cottonmouth, copperhead, rattlesnake):**
- Swelling peaks 24-48 hours
- Pain, bruising, possible necrosis
- Drink water (kidney protection)
- Clean wound (infection risk)
- Rest (minimize movement)
- **Expect:** Severe pain, swelling, bruising for 7-14 days
- **Long-term:** Possible tissue loss at bite site

**Neurotoxic (coral snake):**
- Symptoms may delay 12+ hours
- Difficulty breathing, paralysis
- **CRITICAL:** Without antivenom, respiratory failure possible
- If breathing difficulty: Rescue breathing may be necessary

**Survival rate without treatment:**
- Copperhead: >99%
- Cottonmouth: ~95%
- Rattlesnake: 80-90% (diamondback lower)
- Coral snake: 50-70%

## 5. AMERICAN ALLIGATORS

### Species Profile
**Scientific Name:** Alligator mississippiensis  
**Adult Size:** 8-13 feet (males), 6-10 feet (females), up to 15 feet record  
**Weight:** 200-500 lbs average, up to 1000+ lbs  
**Range:** Coastal plain, freshwater bodies, sometimes brackish water  
**States:** FL, LA, GA, SC, AL, MS, TX (limited: NC, AR, OK)

### Behavior & Threat Assessment

#### When Alligators are Dangerous
**High-Risk Situations:**
1. **Nesting season (June-July):** Female guarding nest, EXTREMELY aggressive
2. **Dawn/dusk feeding:** Active hunting at water's edge
3. **Warm water (>70°F):** Active metabolism, hunting
4. **Fed alligators:** Lose fear of humans, associate humans with food

**Low-Risk Situations:**
1. **Cold weather (<65°F):** Sluggish, less aggressive
2. **Midday (when visible basking):** Not hunting, but still avoid
3. **Large groups of humans:** Usually retreat

#### Attack Profile
- **Ambush predators:** Wait submerged, explosive strike from water
- **Speed:** 20-30 mph in short burst (ONLY in water or very close to shore)
- **On land:** Slow, rarely chase more than 20 feet
- **Death roll:** Grab prey, roll rapidly to disorient and drown
- **Bite force:** 2,980 PSI (strongest measured bite of any animal)

### Fatal Attack Statistics
- **Average:** 1 fatal attack per year in US (mostly Florida)
- **Total (1948-2025):** ~30 documented fatalities
- **Most victims:** Small children, dogs near water, swimmers in murky water
- **Time:** Dawn/dusk, warm months (May-September)

### Avoidance Protocol

**Around Water:**
- **Stay 20+ feet from water's edge** (attack range)
- **Never swim at dawn/dusk** (feeding time)
- **Avoid murky/weedy water** (can't see gators)
- **No swimming where alligators seen** (they are territorial)

**Camping:**
- **Camp 50+ feet from water**
- **Never clean fish near camp** (attracts gators)
- **Pets on leash, away from water** (small dogs = favorite prey)
- **Filter water 20+ feet from shore**

**Water Crossing:**
- **Check for gators BEFORE entering water**
- **Cross at narrow, shallow points** (less likely to have large gators)
- **Move quickly, straight across** (don't linger)
- **Never cross at dawn/dusk**

### Encounter Response

#### If Alligator on Land Near You:
- **Back away slowly** (don't run unless it charges)
- **Give it escape route to water**
- **Don't corner it**
- **If charges: RUN in straight line** (zigzag is myth - they're slow on land)

#### If Grabbed by Alligator:
1. **FIGHT BACK AGGRESSIVELY**
   - Gouge eyes (most sensitive area)
   - Hit snout repeatedly
   - Punch gills (behind jaw)
2. **If in death roll:**
   - Roll WITH the gator (not against)
   - Try to get on its back (weight may cause release)
3. **If dragged underwater:**
   - Attack eyes/snout
   - Try to pry jaws open (nearly impossible due to closing strength)

**Opening Jaws:** Easy (weak opening muscles) - if jaws closed, you can hold them shut with hands. But once open, impossible to keep open.

### Nesting Season (June-July)
**Female Behavior:**
- Builds mound nest (3-4 feet high, grasses/mud)
- Lays 20-50 eggs
- **GUARDS NEST AGGRESSIVELY**
- Will charge anything approaching (including humans, bears)
- Hissing, open-mouth display = imminent charge

**Avoidance:**
- If you see nest (mound near water), LEAVE AREA IMMEDIATELY
- Female may be submerged watching
- Give 100+ foot clearance

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Alligator attack zones (water's edge danger radius), size comparison chart, nest identification.

## 6. FIRE ANTS (Solenopsis invicta)

### Species Profile
**Type:** Invasive (South American), established throughout Southeast  
**Colony Size:** 100,000-500,000 individuals  
**Mound Height:** 6-24 inches (can be hidden in grass)  
**Sting:** Venomous, painful, causes pustule

### Why Fire Ants are Dangerous

**Aggressive Swarming:**
- Entire colony attacks when mound disturbed
- Ants climb silently, then sting simultaneously (chemical signal)
- 100+ stings possible in seconds
- Individual ant can sting multiple times

**Venom Effects:**
- Immediate burning pain (namesake)
- Pustule forms in 24 hours (white, fluid-filled)
- Pustules last 7-10 days
- **Allergic reaction:** Anaphylaxis in ~1-5% of people
  - Swelling
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Hives
  - Can be FATAL without epinephrine

**Annual Impact:**
- 80+ deaths per year in US (anaphylaxis)
- Millions of stings
- Agriculture, infrastructure damage (chew wiring)

### Mound Identification

**Visible Mounds:**
- Irregular dome shape (no visible entrance hole)
- Sandy/loose soil
- Typically in open areas (sun exposure)
- Often multiple mounds clustered (supercolony)

**Hidden Mounds:**
- Under logs, rocks, debris
- In rotted stumps
- Grass-covered (invisible until stepped on)

**Activity:**
- Active year-round in warm Southeast
- Most active 70-90°F (spring/fall)
- Swarm out in seconds when disturbed

### Encounter Prevention

**When Walking:**
- Watch for mounds (learn the pattern)
- Avoid stepping near/on loose dirt piles
- Don't sit/lean against stumps, logs without checking
- Check ground before sitting down

**When Camping:**
- **Check area thoroughly** before setting up
- If mounds nearby (within 50 ft), MOVE CAMP
- Place equipment on elevated surfaces (ants climb)
- Check shoes, clothing before putting on

**In Shelter:**
- Ants will invade structures
- Diatomaceous earth barrier (if available)
- Keep food sealed (attracts foraging ants)

### If Attacked by Fire Ants

#### Immediate Response (Seconds Count)
1. **MOVE AWAY from mound** (they keep coming)
2. **Brush off ants** (fast, vigorous sweeping)
3. **Remove clothing if ants inside** (they swarm up legs)
4. **Don't swat** (makes them release alarm pheromone = more stinging)

#### Treatment (First Hour)
1. **Cold water rinse** (removes any remaining ants)
2. **Cold compress** (reduces pain, swelling)
3. **DO NOT scratch or pop pustules** (infection risk)
4. **Antihistamine if available** (reduces itching, mild allergic response)

#### Anaphylaxis Warning Signs
- Swelling beyond sting area (face, throat)
- Difficulty breathing/swallowing
- Rapid heartbeat
- Dizziness, confusion
- Nausea, vomiting

**If Anaphylaxis:**
- **LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY**
- Epinephrine auto-injector if available (EpiPen)
- Seek medical help IMMEDIATELY
- Lie down, elevate legs
- CPR if breathing stops

#### Long-term Care
- Pustules form in 24 hours (normal)
- Don't pop (infection risk in humid Southeast)
- Clean with soap/water daily
- Infection signs: Red spreading, warmth, pus (not clear fluid)
- Pustules heal in 7-10 days

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Fire ant mound identification (visible vs hidden), sting progression timeline (0-24 hrs), attack response flowchart.

## 7. MOLD & FUNGUS (Humid Environment)

### Southeast Humidity Problem
- **60-90% year-round humidity**
- **Warm temperatures (70-90°F)**
- = PERFECT conditions for mold, mildew, fungus

### Health Hazards

**Respiratory Issues:**
- Mold spores trigger allergies, asthma
- Chronic exposure = lung infections
- **Black mold (Stachybotrys):** Severe reactions, neurological symptoms

**Skin Infections:**
- Athlete's foot, jock itch (fungal)
- Ringworm (fungal, not worm)
- Thrives in hot, sweaty conditions

**Equipment Degradation:**
- Fabric rots (cotton, canvas)
- Leather mildews
- Wood rots
- Boots fall apart (stitching fails)

### Prevention Strategies

**Body Hygiene:**
- **Dry completely after swimming/sweating** (especially feet, groin)
- Air out feet regularly (remove boots/socks periodically)
- Change socks daily (or air-dry if only pair)
- Powder if available (antifungal, drying)

**Equipment Care:**
- **Never store damp gear** (will mold overnight)
- Hang everything to air-dry (boots, clothing, rope)
- Sun exposure kills mold (UV)
- Check leather goods daily (white fuzzy = mildew)

**Shelter:**
- **Maximum ventilation** (cross-breeze)
- Don't seal shelter tightly (traps moisture)
- Elevated sleeping platform (air circulation)
- Roof overhang (rain doesn't hit walls)

**Food Storage:**
- **Check daily for mold**
- Dry foods in sun (nuts, meat jerky)
- Smoked/salted food resists mold better
- Discard moldy food (toxins spread beyond visible mold)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Mold-resistant shelter ventilation design, equipment drying techniques, foot care routine.

## 8. TORNADOES

### Tornado Season
**Primary:** March-May (peak: April-May)  
**Secondary:** November (weaker but still dangerous)  
**Mechanism:** Cold fronts collide with warm, humid air

### Tornado Alley (Southeast Extension)
- Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee particularly vulnerable
- "Dixie Alley" - more deadly than Great Plains Alley due to:
  - Night tornadoes (can't see approaching)
  - Dense forests (hide funnel cloud)
  - Mobile homes (inadequate shelter)

### Enhanced Fujita Scale

| Rating | Wind Speed | Damage | Survival Strategy |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| EF0 | 65-85 mph | Minor (branches, shingles) | Sturdy shelter sufficient |
| EF1 | 86-110 mph | Moderate (windows broken, doors) | Interior room, ground floor |
| EF2 | 111-135 mph | Considerable (roofs off, mobile homes destroyed) | Interior room + cover (mattress) |
| EF3 | 136-165 mph | Severe (walls collapse, trees uprooted) | Underground shelter preferred |
| EF4 | 166-200 mph | Devastating (complete house destruction) | Underground shelter required |
| EF5 | 200+ mph | Catastrophic (total obliteration) | Only deep underground survives |

### Warning System

**Tornado Watch:**
- Conditions favorable for tornadoes
- Stay alert, monitor weather
- Prepare shelter location

**Tornado Warning:**
- Tornado detected (radar or visual)
- TAKE SHELTER IMMEDIATELY
- Average warning time: 13 minutes

**Tornado Emergency:**
- Large, destructive tornado confirmed
- Impacts imminent
- TAKE SHELTER NOW

### Shelter Protocol

#### Best Shelter (in order):
1. **Underground:** Storm cellar, basement (southwest corner)
2. **Interior room:** Ground floor, no windows, center of building
3. **Bathroom:** Small room, plumbing provides structure
4. **Closet:** Interior, small space
5. **Ditch:** If caught outside, lie flat in ditch/depression

#### What to Do:
- Get to lowest floor
- Interior room (away from windows)
- Cover head with hands, mattress, or cushions
- Crouch low (knees, head down)
- If room collapsing: Protect head/neck

#### What NOT to Do:
- ❌ Open windows (myth - doesn't reduce damage)
- ❌ Stay in vehicle (will be thrown)
- ❌ Hide under bridge/overpass (wind tunnel effect)
- ❌ Try to outrun tornado (erratic path)

### Survival in Wilderness (No Structure)

**If Tornado Approaching:**
1. **Identify low-lying area** (ditch, ravine, depression)
2. **Lie flat, face down**
3. **Cover head with hands**
4. **Avoid trees** (will be uprooted, become projectiles)
5. **Do NOT hide in hollow log** (will be thrown with you inside)

**After Tornado:**
- Stay down for 1-2 minutes after winds stop (debris still falling)
- Watch for secondary tornadoes (often come in groups)
- Avoid downed power lines
- Check for injuries (adrenaline masks pain)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Tornado shelter location selection (structure cross-section), outdoor survival positioning.

| Jul | Heat stroke, lightning | Flash floods, snakes | Peak heat danger |
| Aug | Heat stroke, hurricanes peak | Alligators, fire ants | Most dangerous month |
| Sep | Hurricanes, heat | Flooding, snakes | Hurricane peak |
| Oct | Hurricanes end, flooding | Snakes (still active) | Cooling, safer |
| Nov | Tornadoes (secondary) | Cold fronts | Variable |
| Dec | Cold snaps | Rare ice | Generally safe |

### Survival Priority by Threat

**Immediate Life Threat (Minutes-Hours):**
1. Heat stroke (15-60 minutes to death)
2. Tornado (seconds to impact)
3. Flash flood (minutes to develop)
4. Hurricane storm surge (minutes during landfall)

**Acute Threat (Hours-Days):**
5. Alligator attack (unlikely but instant)
6. Venomous snake bite (hours to severe symptoms)
7. Fire ant anaphylaxis (minutes to hours)

**Chronic Threat (Days-Weeks):**
8. Dehydration (3-7 days)
9. Mold/infection (7+ days to serious)
10. Hypothermia (rare, winter only)
