summary: Kelp (Laminaria and Macrocystis species) is a large brown seaweed found in cold coastal waters. Edible, nutritious, high in iodine and minerals. Can be eaten fresh, dried, or cooked. Important
  food source in coastal survival.
warnings:
- Only harvest kelp from clean waters away from pollution, sewage, industrial runoff
- Avoid kelp near shellfish poisoning warning areas
- Very high in iodine - excessive consumption can cause thyroid issues (limit to a few servings per week)
- Kelp can be slippery on rocks - watch for falls
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Large brown seaweed with long blade-like fronds (up to 10+ feet). Holdfast (root-like structure) attaches to rocks. Floats at surface or washes ashore. Common in cold temperate and boreal
  coastlines.'
- 'HARVEST: Cut kelp from rocks at low tide (use knife). Or collect fresh kelp washed ashore after storms (check for freshness - should smell like ocean, not rotten). Sustainable: cut fronds, leave holdfast
  to regrow.'
- 'USES: (1) FRESH: Rinse thoroughly in fresh water to remove salt and sand. Slice into strips. Add to salads, soups, stir-fry. Tough texture. (2) DRIED: Rinse, hang to dry in sun or indoors (1-3 days).
  Dried kelp lasts months. Rehydrate in water before cooking or grind into powder (seasoning, mineral supplement). (3) KELP NOODLES: Slice fresh kelp into thin strips, blanch briefly, use like pasta. (4)
  KELP CHIPS: Dry thin strips, roast until crispy (like kale chips).'
- 'FLAVOR: Salty, umami, ocean-like. Strong flavor.'
- 'NUTRITION: High in iodine (thyroid health), calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, vitamins A and C. Low calorie but nutrient-dense. Traditional anti-scurvy food for sailors.'
