summary: Lacto-fermentation uses naturally-present Lactobacillus bacteria to preserve vegetables in brine. No heat, no special equipment — just salt, water, and a container. Produces vitamins (C, K, B),
  probiotics, and preserved food lasting months.
warnings:
- SALT RATIO IS CRITICAL — too little salt (under 2%) allows dangerous bacteria (Clostridium botulinum) to grow instead of Lactobacillus
- Vegetables MUST stay submerged under brine at all times — exposed surfaces grow mold and can become unsafe
- If ferment smells putrid (rotting meat smell) rather than sour/tangy, discard it — good fermentation smells like vinegar, not garbage
- Pink, black, or fuzzy mold means discard the entire batch. White film (kahm yeast) on surface is harmless — skim it off.
steps:
- 'BASIC BRINE RATIO: 2-3% salt by weight. For sauerkraut method (dry salt): 3 tablespoons salt per 5 lbs vegetables. For brine method (submerged): 1 tablespoon salt per 2 cups water.'
- 'SAUERKRAUT: shred cabbage finely. Sprinkle with salt (3 tbsp per 5 lbs). Massage and squeeze cabbage for 5-10 minutes until it releases liquid and wilts. Pack tightly into container (jar, crock, bucket),
  pressing down until liquid covers the cabbage by at least 1 inch.'
- 'WILD GREENS FERMENT: dandelion leaves, nettles (blanched), plantain, lamb''s quarters — any edible green can be fermented. Chop, pack in brine (1 tbsp salt per 2 cups water). Weight down to keep submerged.
  Ferments in 5-7 days.'
- 'WEIGHT AND COVER: place a clean plate, rock, or water-filled bag on top to keep vegetables submerged. Cover the container with cloth (not airtight) to allow CO2 to escape while keeping insects out.'
- 'FERMENTATION TIMELINE: Days 1-3: bubbles appear (CO2 from fermentation), brine becomes cloudy. Days 3-7: sour taste develops. Days 7-14: flavor deepens. Taste daily after day 5 — move to cold storage
  when flavor is right.'
- 'TEMPERATURE: ideal fermentation temperature is 65-75°F (18-24°C). Below 60°F: fermentation is very slow (weeks). Above 80°F: too fast, mushy texture, off flavors. In hot climates, ferment in shade or
  buried in cool ground.'
- 'WHAT YOU CAN FERMENT: cabbage, radishes, turnips, carrots, beets, green beans, cucumbers (pickles!), peppers, garlic, onions, wild greens, cattail shoots. Basically any firm vegetable. Soft fruits generally
  don''t work well.'
- 'CUCUMBER PICKLES: pack whole small cucumbers in brine (1 tbsp salt per 2 cups water) with optional garlic, dill, grape/oak/horseradish leaves (contain tannins that keep pickles crispy). Ferment 5-7 days.
  Grape/oak leaves are the secret to crunchy pickles.'
- 'STORAGE: finished ferments store for 4-6 months in cool conditions (cellar, underground cache, shaded location). Colder = longer preservation. In warm climates, eat within 1-2 months. The ferment continues
  slowly — it gets more sour over time.'
- 'NUTRITIONAL VALUE: fermentation INCREASES nutritional value — B vitamins increase 3-10x, vitamin C is preserved (unlike cooking which destroys it), and Lactobacillus probiotics improve gut health and
  nutrient absorption. In historical sieges, sauerkraut prevented scurvy.'
