steps:
- 'Vitamin C (scurvy): bleeding gums, loose teeth, slow wound healing, fatigue. Onset
  1-3 months. Sources: rose hips, pine needles, greens, berries.'
- 'Vitamin A: night blindness, dry skin. Sources: orange/yellow plants, liver, dark
  greens.'
- 'Iron: fatigue, pallor, weakness, rapid heartbeat. Sources: nettle, meat, dark greens.'
- 'B vitamins: cracked lips, confusion, dermatitis. Sources: whole grains, meat, legumes.'
- 'Iodine: goiter (neck swelling), fatigue. Sources: seaweed, fish, iodized salt.'
warnings:
- Scurvy can become fatal if untreated.
- Night blindness from vitamin A deficiency impairs safety.
- Iron deficiency severely reduces work capacity.

## Overview
Field recognition of common nutritional deficiencies that develop over weeks to months of restricted diet. Early detection enables targeted foraging.

## Step-by-step
1. Vitamin C (scurvy): bleeding gums, loose teeth, slow wound healing, fatigue. Onset 1-3 months. Sources: rose hips, pine needles, greens, berries.
2. Vitamin A: night blindness, dry skin. Sources: orange/yellow plants, liver, dark greens.
3. Iron: fatigue, pallor, weakness, rapid heartbeat. Sources: nettle, meat, dark greens.
4. B vitamins: cracked lips, confusion, dermatitis. Sources: whole grains, meat, legumes.
5. Iodine: goiter (neck swelling), fatigue. Sources: seaweed, fish, iodized salt.

## Warnings
- Scurvy can become fatal if untreated.
- Night blindness from vitamin A deficiency impairs safety.
- Iron deficiency severely reduces work capacity.
