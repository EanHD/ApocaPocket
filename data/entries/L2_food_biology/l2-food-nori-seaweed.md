summary: Nori (Porphyra species), also called laver, is a red/purple seaweed that grows on rocks in intertidal zones. Edible raw or dried. High in protein compared to other seaweeds. Familiar as sushi wrapper.
warnings:
- Harvest from clean water only
- Can be difficult to distinguish from similar inedible seaweeds - consult field guide
- High in protein but also high in purines - people with gout should limit consumption
- Fresh nori spoils quickly - dry or eat within 1-2 days
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Thin, paper-like red or purple-brown seaweed growing on rocks in intertidal zone. Fronds are delicate, ruffled edges. Exposed at low tide. Global distribution in cold to temperate waters.'
- 'HARVEST: Low tide. Peel nori off rocks by hand. Rinse thoroughly in seawater, then fresh water. Sustainable: take small amounts from multiple locations.'
- 'USES: (1) FRESH: Eat raw (salty, slightly fishy). Chop and add to salads or soups. (2) DRIED: Spread thin on cloth or screen, sun-dry or air-dry until crispy (1-2 days). Dried nori lasts months. (3)
  ROASTED: Toast dried nori briefly over flame (enhances flavor, makes it crispy). (4) SEASONING: Crumble dried nori over rice, soups, or grind into powder.'
- 'FLAVOR: Salty, umami, slightly fishy. Roasting improves flavor.'
- 'NUTRITION: Higher in protein than most seaweeds (up to 35% dry weight). High in vitamins A, C, B12 (rare in plant foods), iodine, iron. Excellent coastal survival food.'
