summary: Hardtack is an unleavened cracker made of only flour, water, and optional salt. When fully dried, it lasts years to decades. Civil War-era hardtack has been found edible after 150+ years. The simplest
  long-term carbohydrate storage food.
warnings:
- Hardtack is extremely hard when dry — biting into it can crack teeth. Always soak or cook before eating.
- Watch for weevils (small beetles) in stored hardtack — tap on a hard surface to knock them out. The hardtack is still safe to eat, the bugs are extra protein
- Low nutritional variety — hardtack provides carbohydrates but lacks protein, fat, and vitamins. Supplement with pemmican, foraged greens, and fat sources
- Store in absolutely airtight, moisture-proof containers — any moisture causes mold
steps:
- 'RECIPE: 2 cups flour (any type — white, wheat, wild acorn flour, or mix), ½ cup water, ½ teaspoon salt (optional). That''s it. No yeast, no fat, no sugar — these all reduce shelf life.'
- 'MIX: combine flour and salt. Add water gradually, mixing with hands. Dough should be stiff and not sticky — add flour if sticky, add water drops if crumbly. Knead for 2-3 minutes until smooth.'
- 'ROLL AND CUT: roll dough to 1/3 inch thick (no thicker — won''t dry properly). Cut into 3×3 inch squares. Dock (poke holes) with a fork, skewer, or nail — holes go ALL the way through. 16 holes per cracker
  in a 4×4 grid. Holes allow moisture to escape and prevent puffing.'
- 'BAKE: in an oven at 250°F (120°C) for 2 hours, flipping halfway. In field conditions: place on flat stone next to fire, not over direct flame. Turn frequently. Cook until completely dry and hard — should
  sound hollow when tapped.'
- 'DRY FURTHER: after initial baking, leave in warm dry area for 2-3 more days to drive out all remaining moisture. The drier, the longer it lasts. Should be rock-hard and make a ''clink'' sound when dropped
  on stone.'
- 'YIELD AND NUTRITION: recipe makes ~8 crackers. Each cracker ≈ 120 calories. Per pound: ~1500 calories, mostly carbohydrates (low protein, no fat). One person needs about 1 lb/day as base carbohydrate
  ration.'
- 'EATING METHODS: (1) Soak in water, coffee, or broth for 15-30 minutes until soft. (2) Crumble into soup or stew. (3) Fry in fat/grease (called ''skillygalee'' in Civil War). (4) Break with a rock and
  chew slowly (emergency only — hard on teeth and jaw).'
- 'STORAGE: wrap individually in cloth or paper, pack in airtight tin, plastic bag, or sealed container. Include a desiccant if available (rice grains, dried silica packets). Store in coolest, driest location
  available.'
- 'FIELD VARIATION — ASH CAKES: if no oven available, mix flour and water into thick dough, wrap around a stick, and cook over coals. Not as long-lasting as true hardtack but works in a pinch.'
- 'SHELF LIFE: properly made and stored hardtack lasts 5-50+ years. Signs of spoilage: mold (colored spots), rancid smell (indicates fat contamination), crumbles instead of snapping (absorbed moisture).'
