## 1. NOR'EASTERS - Multi-Day Coastal Storms

### What is a Nor'easter?
**Definition:** Low-pressure system that moves up the Atlantic coast, producing northeast winds over coastal areas.

**Characteristics:**
- **Duration:** 12 hours to 3+ days (multi-day events common)
- **Snow:** 1-4 feet common, up to 5-6 feet in extreme events
- **Wind:** 30-60 mph sustained, gusts 70-90 mph (coastal)
- **Coastal flooding:** Storm surge 2-8 feet + astronomical high tides
- **Power outages:** Days to weeks (widespread tree/line damage)

**Season:** October-April (peak: January-March)

**Frequency:** 5-15 significant nor'easters per winter

---

### Nor'easter Categories (Unofficial Scale)

| Category | Snow | Wind (Coastal) | Impact | Historical Examples |
|----------|------|----------------|--------|---------------------|
| Minor | 6-12" | 30-45 mph | Local closures, brief outages | Common (10-20/year) |
| Moderate | 12-24" | 45-60 mph | Regional disruption, power out 1-3 days | 3-8/year |
| Major | 24-36" | 60-75 mph | Multi-state emergency, power out 3-7 days | 1-3/year |
| Extreme | 36"+ | 75-90+ mph | Catastrophic, power out weeks | Rare (1-3/decade) |

**Historic Extreme Nor'easters:**
- **Blizzard of 1888:** 40-50" snow, 400+ deaths, entire Northeast paralyzed for week
- **Blizzard of 1978:** 27" Boston, 100+ mph winds, 54 deaths, power out 10+ days
- **Superstorm of 1993:** "Storm of the Century," 43" snow (TN mountains), 270 deaths
- **January 2016:** 27" NYC, 30" Boston, Washington DC paralyzed

---

### Nor'easter Hazards

#### Heavy Snow
- **Accumulation rates:** 2-4 inches per hour (can't keep up with plowing)
- **Snowdrifts:** 6-12 feet drifts (wind-driven)
- **Roof collapse:** 3+ feet snow = 50-80+ lbs per sq ft (residential roofs at risk)
- **Isolation:** Roads impassable for days (even major highways)

#### High Winds
- **Tree damage:** Especially in wet, heavy snow (branches break, trees uproot)
- **Power lines:** Downed by trees and ice weight
- **Whiteout:** Blowing snow reduces visibility to zero
- **Wind chill:** Already cold temps + wind = -20°F to -40°F wind chill

#### Coastal Flooding
- **Storm surge:** 2-8 feet above normal tide (northeast wind pushes water onshore)
- **Astronomical tides:** Nor'easters often align with full/new moon (higher tides)
- **Wave action:** 15-25 foot waves (coastal erosion, damage)
- **Flooding:** Low-lying coastal areas inundated (homes, businesses)

#### Power Outages
- **Duration:** Days to weeks (widespread damage, hard to access repair sites)
- **Cascading effects:**
  - No heat (in winter storm = life-threatening)
  - No water (pumps down, frozen pipes)
  - No communication (cell towers down, internet out)
  - No food refrigeration (actually less of an issue - outdoor temps freezing)

---

### Nor'easter Survival Protocol

#### 48-72 Hours Before (Watch Issued)
- Monitor NOAA Weather Radio / NWS forecasts
- Stock supplies:
  - **Food:** 7-14 days (no power, no travel)
  - **Water:** 1 gal/person/day x 7 days (pipes may freeze)
  - **Firewood:** Bring 2+ weeks indoors (can't access outdoor pile in 4 ft snow)
  - **Medications:** Full supply
  - **Batteries, flashlights, radio**
- Charge all devices (power WILL fail)
- Fill bathtubs (backup water)
- Bring pets indoors
- Move vehicles to shelter (avoid drifts, falling trees)
- Check generator, fuel (if available)

#### 12-24 Hours Before (Warning Issued)
- Finalize preparations
- **Coastal residents:** Evacuate if in flood zone (storm surge + high tide = dangerous)
- Prepare central room (easiest to heat if power fails)
- Set faucets to drip (prevent frozen pipes if heat fails)
- Clear storm drains near property (reduce local flooding)

#### During Nor'easter
1. **STAY INSIDE:** Zero visibility, deadly cold, risk of disorientation even 50 ft from door
2. **Central room:** If power fails, gather in one room (easier to heat)
3. **Heat priority:**
   - Fireplace/wood stove (if available)
   - Kerosene heater (MUST have ventilation - CO risk)
   - Propane heater (ventilation critical)
   - NEVER use gas stove/oven for heat (CO poisoning)
4. **Conserve heat:**
   - Close off unused rooms
   - Hang blankets over windows
   - Seal gaps (towels under doors)
5. **Ventilation:** If using any combustion heat, crack window (CO poisoning kills)
6. **Hydration:** Dehydration sneaky in winter (less thirst sensation)
7. **Check on neighbors:** Especially elderly, disabled

#### Peak Danger: Night 1-2
- Power usually fails during peak winds (night 1 or 2)
- Coldest period (multi-day cold snap often follows)
- **Carbon monoxide danger peaks** (people use emergency heating without proper ventilation)

#### After Nor'easter
- **Wait for official all-clear** (drifts, downed lines, continued snow)
- **Downed power lines:** Assume ALL are live (stay 30+ feet away)
- **Roof snow removal:** If 3+ feet accumulated (collapse risk)
  - Work from ground with roof rake if possible
  - If must go on roof: Safety rope, partner watching, avoid sudden removal (shock load)
- **Check on neighbors:** Especially vulnerable populations
- **Frozen pipes:** If heat failed, pipes may burst when thawing (shut off water main)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Nor'easter track map, storm surge + tide flooding zones, power outage preparation checklist.

## 2. ICE STORMS - Freezing Rain Events

### Ice Storm Profile
**Mechanism:** Warm air aloft, freezing air at surface = rain freezes on contact with ground/objects

**Ice Accumulation:**
- **1/4 inch:** Minor (slick roads, tree bending)
- **1/2 inch:** Moderate (power outages begin, trees damaged)
- **3/4 inch:** Major (widespread power outages, many trees down)
- **1+ inch:** Catastrophic (total grid failure, trees snapped, infrastructure damage)

**Duration:** 6-36 hours of continuous freezing rain

**Geographic Risk:** Highest in interior Northeast (NY, PA, VT, NH - transition zones between warm/cold air)

---

### Ice Storm Hazards

#### Power Grid Collapse
**Mechanism:** Ice weight on power lines + tree branches = cascading failures

**1/2 inch ice weight:**
- Power lines: 500+ lbs per span
- Trees: Branches break, fall on lines
- Cascading effect: One line down causes overload on others

**Result:**
- **Total blackout:** Entire regions dark (millions without power)
- **Duration:** 1-3 weeks (longer than nor'easters - more damage, harder repairs)
- **Winter conditions:** No heat during freezing temps = life-threatening

**Historic Ice Storms:**
- **1998 Ice Storm (Quebec/NY/VT/NH/ME):** 4 million without power (some for 4+ weeks), 80+ deaths
- **2008 Ice Storm (NH/MA):** 1.3 million without power, week+ restoration

#### Tree Damage
**Ice weight on trees:**
- 1/2 inch: Branches bend 45°
- 3/4 inch: Major branches break
- 1 inch: Trees snap at trunk, uproot

**Forests:** Up to 50-80% tree damage (catastrophic)
**Danger:** Falling branches, trees (during storm + weeks after)

#### Impossible Travel
- Roads: Mirror-like ice (sand/salt ineffective during continued freezing rain)
- Walking: Can't stand up (1/4 inch ice = skating rink)
- Emergency services: Can't respond (ambulance, fire, police)

---

### Ice Storm Survival Protocol

#### Before Ice Storm (Watch/Warning)
- Same prep as nor'easter (assume 1-3 weeks without power)
- **Extra firewood:** Ice storms = longer outages than snowstorms
- **Stay home:** Once ice starts, roads instantly impassable

#### During Ice Storm
1. **STAY INSIDE:** Falling branches kill people every ice storm
2. **Avoid windows:** Branches can crash through
3. **Move to interior room:** If large trees near house
4. **Listen for cracking sounds:** Trees breaking (get to safest room)
5. **Heat priority:** Same as nor'easter (wood stove best, ventilation critical)
6. **Do NOT try to remove ice:** Futile, dangerous (wait for thaw)

#### Specific Dangers

**Falling Trees/Branches:**
- **Random:** No warning, trees fail suddenly
- **Progressive:** Storm lasts hours, trees fail throughout (ongoing danger)
- **Delayed:** Weakened trees fail hours/days after storm ends
- **Avoid trees:** Don't walk/drive under damaged trees for days after

**Power Line Dangers:**
- Ice-covered lines look harmless (but live)
- Lines on ground hidden under ice/snow
- **Assume ALL downed lines are live**
- **Stay 30+ feet away** (can arc through ice/water)

**Carbon Monoxide:**
- Longer outage = more desperation for heat
- People use charcoal grills, generators indoors (DEADLY)
- **Never use combustion heat source indoors without ventilation**
- CO detectors (battery-powered)

#### After Ice Storm
- **Stay inside until all-clear:** Trees continue falling for 24-48 hours
- **Downed power lines:** Report, avoid
- **Generator use:** OUTSIDE only, 20+ feet from doors/windows (CO kills)
- **Tree damage assessment:** From distance, hire professionals for removal
- **Long-term outage plan:** If power restoration 1+ weeks, consider relocation to shelter/powered area

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Ice accumulation dangers (weight on structures/trees), power line safety distances, carbon monoxide sources and detector placement.

## 3. LYME DISEASE & TICK-BORNE ILLNESSES

### Northeast = Lyme Disease Capital of US

**Statistics:**
- **90%+ of US Lyme cases** occur in Northeast
- **Endemic states:** CT, MA, RI, NY, NJ, PA, VT, NH, ME, MD, DE
- **Incidence:** 20-100+ cases per 100,000 people (vs <5 nationwide)
- **Trend:** Increasing every year (tick range expanding, deer populations high)

---

### Blacklegged Tick (Deer Tick) - *Ixodes scapularis*

**Primary Lyme Vector**

**Identification:**
- **Size:** TINY
  - Larva: Pinhead
  - Nymph: Poppy seed (1-2mm) - MOST COMMON biter
  - Adult: Sesame seed (3-5mm)
- **Color:** Dark brown/black legs, reddish-brown body
- **Features:** 8 legs, no antennae (arachnid)

**Habitat:**
- Forests (leaf litter)
- Brush/tall grass edges
- Stone walls (mice/chipmunks harbor there = tick habitat)
- Wood piles
- Suburban yards (especially near woods)

**Behavior:**
- **Questing:** Climbs to tips of grass/leaves, arms extended (waiting for host)
- Detects: CO2, body heat, movement
- Transfers on contact (doesn't jump or fly)
- Crawls upward (seeks warm, hidden areas)

**Diseases Carried:**
1. **Lyme disease** (*Borrelia burgdorferi*) - 20-30% of nymphs infected in endemic areas
2. **Anaplasmosis** (*Anaplasma phagocytophilum*)
3. **Babesiosis** (*Babesia microti*) - Blood parasite, malaria-like
4. **Powassan virus** - Rare but SERIOUS (can be fatal, no treatment)

---

### Lyme Disease - Detailed Profile

**Transmission:**
- Tick must be attached **36-48 hours** for transmission (early removal = very low risk)
- Nymphs most dangerous (spring/early summer, tiny, unnoticed)

#### Stage 1: Early Localized (3-30 days post-bite)

**Erythema Migrans (EM) Rash:**
- Appears in **70-80% of cases** (but 20-30% never get rash)
- **"Bull's-eye" pattern:** Red outer ring, clear center, red center (but not always)
- Size: Expands over days/weeks (3-12+ inches diameter)
- **Not itchy or painful** (easy to miss under clothing)
- Warm to touch
- Can appear anywhere (not just bite site - bacteria spreads)

**Flu-like Symptoms:**
- Fever, chills (99-102°F)
- Headache (severe)
- Fatigue (extreme)
- Muscle aches, joint pain
- Swollen lymph nodes

**Treatment:**
- **Antibiotics:** Doxycycline 100mg 2x/day for 14-21 days
- **Alternative:** Amoxicillin (if doxycycline contraindicated)
- **Outcome:** ~95% cure rate if treated in Stage 1

---

#### Stage 2: Early Disseminated (weeks-months)

**If untreated, bacteria spreads:**
- **Multiple EM rashes** (bacteria in bloodstream)
- **Facial palsy (Bell's palsy):** One side of face droops (7% of untreated cases)
- **Arthritis:** Swollen, painful joints (especially knees)
- **Carditis:** Heart rhythm problems (palpitations, light-headedness)
- **Neurological:** Severe headaches, neck stiffness, nerve pain, numbness
- **Fatigue:** Debilitating

**Treatment:**
- Oral antibiotics (longer course, 28 days)
- IV antibiotics if neurological/cardiac involvement

---

#### Stage 3: Late Disseminated (months-years)

**Chronic Lyme (if untreated for months/years):**
- **Chronic arthritis:** Persistent joint swelling (knees most common)
- **Neurological problems:**
  - Memory impairment ("brain fog")
  - Concentration difficulties
  - Sleep disturbances
  - Mood changes (depression, anxiety)
- **Chronic fatigue:** Disabling exhaustion
- **Numbness, tingling in extremities**

**Treatment:**
- Difficult at this stage (bacteria may be in tissues, less responsive)
- Long antibiotic courses (weeks to months)
- May have permanent effects

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Early treatment is KEY. If you see bull's-eye rash OR flu-like symptoms after tick bite, START ANTIBIOTICS IMMEDIATELY.

---

### Tick Prevention Protocol

#### Clothing & Repellent
1. **Permethrin treatment:** Spray clothing, boots (kills ticks on contact)
   - Lasts 6 weeks or 6 washes
   - Treat before season (April)
   - Most effective prevention tool
2. **Light-colored clothing:** Easier to spot ticks (dark brown on white/khaki)
3. **Long pants tucked into socks:** Physical barrier
4. **Long sleeves**
5. **Hat**
6. **DEET repellent on exposed skin:** 20-30% concentration

#### Behavioral Prevention
- **Stay on trails:** Avoid brushing against vegetation (ticks quest on tips)
- **Avoid tall grass, brush**
- **Avoid sitting on ground, logs:** Use tarp or stay on rocks
- **Stay in center of trail** (not brushing edges)
- **Walk in open areas** (sun-exposed = fewer ticks)

---

### Tick Check Protocol (CRITICAL)

**When:**
- **Immediately after outdoor activity** (within 1-2 hours)
- **Before bed** (full body check)
- **Next morning** (check again - ticks migrate, hard to find at night)

**Where to Check (Priority):**
1. **Scalp/hairline:** Run fingers through hair slowly (feel for bumps)
2. **Behind ears:** Common attachment site
3. **Neck (back and front)**
4. **Armpits:** Warm, moist, hidden
5. **Groin/genitals:** Warm, moist, hidden (most commonly missed)
6. **Behind knees**
7. **Waistband area** (belly button)
8. **Between toes**
9. **Anywhere else:** Ticks can attach ANYWHERE

**How:**
- **Mirror:** Check back, hard-to-see areas
- **Partner check:** Another person checks your scalp, back
- **Feel:** Run hands over entire body (small bumps)
- **Visual:** Look closely at all skin

**Why this matters:**
- **<24 hours attached:** <1% Lyme risk
- **24-48 hours attached:** ~5-10% risk
- **48-72 hours attached:** 25%+ risk
- **Every hour counts**

---

### Tick Removal Technique

**Tools:** Fine-tipped tweezers (or dedicated tick removal tool)

**Steps:**
1. **Grasp tick at mouthparts** (as close to skin as possible, NOT body)
2. **Pull straight up** with steady, even pressure (NO twisting, NO jerking)
3. **Don't squeeze body** (forces bacteria into wound)
4. **Clean area** with alcohol or soap/water
5. **Save tick in sealed bag** with date (for testing if symptoms develop)
6. **Monitor bite site** for 30 days (watch for rash)

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Burn tick
- ❌ Apply petroleum jelly, nail polish
- ❌ Twist while pulling
- ❌ Squeeze body
(All force tick to regurgitate = more bacteria into you)

**If mouthparts break off:**
- Try to remove with tweezers
- If can't remove, leave it (body will expel over time)
- Clean area, monitor for infection

---

### When to Seek Medical Care

**Immediate (within 24-48 hours):**
- Tick was attached >24 hours AND you're in endemic area
  - **Prophylactic doxycycline:** Single 200mg dose (reduces Lyme risk by 87%)
- Bull's-eye rash appears (ANY time after bite, 3-30 days)
- Flu-like symptoms within 30 days of tick bite

**Urgent:**
- Multiple rashes
- Facial palsy (face drooping)
- Severe headache with neck stiffness
- Heart palpitations
- Joint swelling (especially knees)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Tick life stages (actual size), proper removal technique, Lyme rash progression, tick check body map.

- **Vermont:** 6,000
- **New Hampshire:** 5,000-6,000
- **Massachusetts:** 5,000 (expanding into suburbs)
- **Connecticut:** 1,000+ (recent recolonization)

**Trend:** INCREASING, expanding into suburbs

---

### Black Bear Profile

**Size:**
- **Males:** 200-400 lbs (up to 600 lbs rare)
- **Females:** 150-250 lbs
- Height: 5-6 feet standing

**Diet:**
- 85% vegetation (berries, nuts, grasses, roots)
- 10% insects (grubs, ants, bees/honey)
- 5% meat (fawns, carrion, fish)
- **Opportunistic:** Will eat ANYTHING caloric (human food, garbage, bird feeders)

**Behavior:**
- Generally shy, avoid humans
- Excellent climbers (can climb trees)
- Fast (30 mph in short burst)
- Excellent sense of smell (7x better than bloodhound)
- Poor eyesight (nearsighted)

**Activity:**

- **Hibernate:** Nov-Mar/Apr (den in hollow trees, caves, brush piles)
- **Mating season:** June-July (males roam widely)
- **Cubs:** Born in den (Jan-Feb), emerge with mother in spring

---

### When Black Bears are Dangerous

**1. Food-Conditioned Bears (Biggest Threat)**
- Have learned humans = food (garbage, bird feeders, picnic areas)
- Lose natural fear of humans
- Will approach humans expecting food
- Can become aggressive if food denied

**2. Sow with Cubs (May-July)**
- Mother extremely protective
- Will bluff charge (rarely actual attack)
- Give 100+ ft space if you see cubs

**3. Surprised Bear**
- Startled at close range
- May attack defensively

**4. Predatory Bear (Very Rare)**
- Stalking behavior (following, circling)
- Different from curious/food-seeking
- Preparing to attack

---

### Bear Encounter Protocol

#### Prevention (Best Defense)
1. **Make noise while hiking:** Talk, clap, "Hey bear!" every minute
   - Bears avoid humans if they hear you coming
   - Surprise encounters most dangerous
2. **Travel in groups:** Groups rarely attacked
3. **Avoid dawn/dusk/night:** Peak bear activity
4. **Food storage:**
   - **Bear canisters** (hard-sided, approved)
   - **Bear bag hang:** 12+ ft high, 6+ ft from trunk (difficult, less reliable)
   - **Never in tent:** Food, toiletries, scented items OUT
5. **Clean camp:** No food smells (wash dishes, store trash)

#### If You See a Bear (Distance >100 ft)
- **Stay calm**
- **Identify yourself:** Talk calmly, "Hey bear, I'm human"
- **Wave arms slowly** (appear large, human-like)
- **Back away slowly** (don't run)
- **Give it space** (detour widely)
- **Don't approach:** For photos, closer look (people do this - stupid)

#### If Bear Approaches (Distance <100 ft)
- **Stand your ground**
- **Talk firmly:** "Go away bear, get out of here"
- **Raise arms, jacket** (appear larger)
- **Group together** (if with others, appear as one large organism)
- **Do NOT run** (triggers chase instinct, can't outrun - 30 mph)
- **Do NOT climb tree** (black bears excellent climbers)

#### If Bear Charges (Bluff Charge - Most Common)
- **Stand your ground** (hardest thing to do, but critical)
- **Do NOT run**
- **Prepare bear spray** (if you have it)
- Most charges stop at 10-20 feet (bluff)
- Bear may "huff," "pop" jaw, slap ground (intimidation)

#### If Bear Contacts You (Defensive Attack)
- **PLAY DEAD:**
  - Lie flat on stomach OR curl in ball
  - Hands behind neck (protect neck/head)
  - Legs spread (harder to flip over)
  - Stay still and silent
  - Bear usually leaves once threat neutralized (you're "dead")
- **Wait several minutes after bear leaves** (may be watching)

#### If Bear Continues Attack (Predatory - Very Rare)
- **FIGHT BACK:**
  - This is NOT defensive (bear is hunting you)
  - Signs: Stalking before attack, continues attacking despite playing dead
  - Use everything: Rocks, sticks, fists, kick
  - Target: Eyes, nose (sensitive areas)
  - Yell, scream (makes you seem not worth the effort)
  - **Do NOT give up** (your life depends on it)

---

### Bear Spray
**Active ingredient:** Capsaicin (pepper)  
**Effective range:** 20-30 feet  
**Effectiveness:** 90%+ success rate in deterring bears  
**How to use:**
1. Carry in holster (accessible in seconds)
2. Remove safety clip
3. When bear within 20-30 feet: Spray in 2-second bursts
4. Aim at face/nose
5. Create cloud bear must pass through
6. Back away once bear affected

## 5. MOOSE ENCOUNTERS & COLLISIONS

### Moose Profile (Northern Northeast)

**Range:** Maine (most common), New Hampshire, Vermont, northern NY (Adirondacks)

**Size:**
- **Bulls:** 800-1200 lbs, 6-7 ft at shoulder
- **Cows:** 600-800 lbs, 5-6 ft at shoulder
- **Antlers (bulls only):** 4-6 ft spread, 40+ lbs (shed in winter)

**Population:**
- Maine: 60,000-70,000 (highest in lower 48)
- New Hampshire: 4,000-5,000
- Vermont: 3,000-4,000

---

### When Moose are Dangerous

**1. Cows with Calves (May-July)**
- EXTREMELY protective
- Will charge anything near calves (humans, bears, cars)
- Trampling with front hooves (powerful, deadly)

**2. Bulls in Rut (September-October)**
- Testosterone-driven aggression
- Will charge anything perceived as threat or rival
- Unpredictable behavior

**3. Moose-Vehicle Collisions**
- **1000+ lbs animal on long legs**
- **Impact zone = windshield level** (not bumper)
- Driver/passengers hit by full body weight
- **Deadly:** 1-2 deaths per year in Maine alone, 100s of injuries

---

### Moose Encounter Protocol

#### On Foot
- **Give 50+ ft space** (100+ ft if cow with calf or bull in rut)
- **Never approach:** For photos, closer look
- **Watch for warning signs:**
  - Ears pinned back
  - Raised hackles on neck
  - Licking lips
  - Aggressive posture (head down, eyes wide)
- **If moose charges:**
  - RUN and hide behind tree, large rock
  - Moose won't follow around obstacle (usually)
  - If knocked down: Curl in ball, protect head/neck
  - Wait for moose to leave

#### Vehicle Collisions (Major Hazard)

**High-Risk Conditions:**
- **Dawn/dusk:** Moose most active (poor visibility)
- **Spring:** Moose move to roadside salt licks
- **Fall:** Rut season (bulls roam widely)
- **Night:** Dark brown animal, nearly invisible
- **Rural roads:** Through forest/wetland (moose habitat)

**Prevention:**
- Slow down in moose zones (road signs)
- Scan roadsides constantly
- High beams when no oncoming traffic (see eyes reflecting)
- Extra caution dusk/dawn/night

**If Moose on Road:**
- **BRAKE** (don't swerve - ditch/tree worse than moose)
- **Honk horn** (may move)
- **Stop if necessary:** Wait for moose to leave road

**If Collision Imminent:**
- Brake hard
- Duck below dashboard (moose body comes through windshield)
- Airbags deploy (good)
- Brace for impact

**After Collision:**
- Check for injuries
- Exit vehicle carefully (moose may still be alive and dangerous)
- Call emergency services

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Moose warning sign behaviors, vehicle collision impact zone diagram, safe distance illustration.

## 6. COLD EXPOSURE (See Midwest for detailed cold protocols)

**Northeast-specific factors:**
- Mountains (White, Green, Adirondacks): Severe, rapid weather changes
- Coastal wind: Penetrating, increases wind chill
- Nor'easters: Multi-day cold exposure during storm isolation

**Key differences from Midwest:**
- Slightly warmer overall (but mountains compensate)
- Higher humidity (feels colder for same temperature)
- Longer exposure periods (multi-day storms)

**See l2-regional-midwest-hazards.md for comprehensive hypothermia/frostbite protocols.**

1. Hypothermia (during nor'easter, power failure) - Hours to death
2. Carbon monoxide (improper heating) - Hours to death
3. Moose attack (rare) - Seconds to injury
4. Bear attack (very rare) - Seconds to injury

**Acute Threat (Hours-Days):**
5. Frostbite (-20°F+ wind chill) - Minutes to injury
6. Nor'easter isolation (multi-day no power/heat) - Days without help
7. Ice storm (tree/power line dangers) - Ongoing risk days after storm

**Chronic Threat (Days-Weeks+):**
8. Lyme disease (untreated) - Weeks to months for progression
9. Prolonged power outage (no heat in winter) - Days to life-threatening
10. Starvation (winter isolation) - Weeks
