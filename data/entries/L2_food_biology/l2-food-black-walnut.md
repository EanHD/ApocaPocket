summary: Black walnut (Juglans nigra) produces edible nuts with strong flavor. Outer husk must be removed (stains hands dark brown). Inner shell is very hard to crack. Nut meat is oily and intensely flavored.
  Labor-intensive but rewarding.
warnings:
- Husks stain hands, clothing, and surfaces dark brown (nearly permanent) - wear gloves
- Shells are extremely hard - most difficult nut to crack
- Strong flavor is polarizing - some love it, others find it overpowering
- Black walnut trees produce juglone (allelopathic compound that kills nearby plants) - do not plant gardens near black walnut trees
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Large tree, compound leaves (15-23 leaflets). Nuts have thick green husk (2-3 inches diameter), inner shell is hard, ridged. Eastern North America.'
- 'HARVEST: Fall. Collect nuts from ground. Remove husk immediately (husk decays and becomes harder to remove). HUSKING: (1) Wear gloves. (2) Step on nut to split husk, peel off. (3) Or run over with car
  tire. (4) Rinse nuts.'
- 'CURING: Spread husked nuts in single layer in warm, dry place for 2-4 weeks. Nuts must cure before cracking (improves flavor, makes shells easier to crack).'
- 'CRACKING: Use vise, heavy hammer, or specialized nut cracker. Shell is extremely hard. Extract nut meat with pick. Low yield (10-20% kernel by weight).'
- 'USES: Baking (cookies, brownies - strong flavor), ice cream, salads. Roast for enhanced flavor. Black walnut oil (press kernels - labor-intensive).'
- 'NUTRITION: High in fat, protein, omega-3 fatty acids. Intense flavor means a little goes a long way.'
