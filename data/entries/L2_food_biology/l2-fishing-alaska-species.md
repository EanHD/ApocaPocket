# Alaska Fish Species - Identification & Harvest

**🎣 ALASKA FISHING REALITY**: World-class freshwater and saltwater fishing. Salmon runs provide MASSIVE seasonal protein (June-September). Trout, char, and grayling available year-round. Focus on high-yield opportunities.

**🔑 KEY STRATEGY**: Time your fishing around salmon runs (July-August peak). One day of salmon fishing = weeks of food.

---

## 🐟 Salmon (Top Priority - Seasonal Abundance)

### Overview: The Five Pacific Salmon

**All species:**
- Anadromous (born in freshwater, migrate to ocean, return to spawn)
- Die after spawning (semelparous life cycle)
- Seasonal runs (specific timing by river/location)
- Massive protein source (2-30 lbs per fish)

**Survival Strategy**: Focus efforts on peak run timing (July-August for most species). One good day = 50-200 lbs of meat.

---

### 1. King / Chinook Salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*)

**Size**: 20-50 lbs (largest), up to 100 lbs (rare)  
**Run Timing**: May-July (earliest run)  
**Best Harvest**: Late June-Early July

**Identification:**
- **Color**: Dark blue/green back, silver sides, black spots on back AND tail
- **Mouth**: Black gums (key identifier)
- **Tail**: Fully spotted (distinguishes from Coho)
- **Size**: Largest of all salmon
- **Flesh**: Deep red-orange (high fat content)

**Spawning Changes**: Males develop hooked jaw (kype), body turns dark red/brown

**Harvest Quality:**
- **Ocean-bright** (just entering river): Excellent (firm, oily, best eating)
- **Mid-river** (1-2 weeks in river): Good (still edible)
- **Near-spawning** (dark, hooked): Poor (flesh softens, loses flavor, still edible but lower quality)

**Where to Find**: Large rivers (Kenai, Copper, Yukon), coastal areas, deep pools

**Fishing Technique**: Heavy gear (salmon eggs, spinners, bait), strong current areas

**Yield**: 12-25 lbs fillet per fish (50% of body weight)

---

### 2. Sockeye / Red Salmon (*Oncorhynchus nerka*)

**Size**: 5-8 lbs (average), up to 15 lbs  
**Run Timing**: June-August (peak: July)  
**Best Harvest**: Mid-July (largest numbers)

**Identification:**
- **Color**: Greenish-blue back, bright silver sides (ocean-bright)
- **Spots**: NO spots on back or tail (distinguishes from King)
- **Eyes**: Large, prominent
- **Flesh**: Deep red (highest fat content, richest flavor)

**Spawning Changes**: Body turns BRIGHT RED, head turns green (males have pronounced hump and kype)

**Harvest Quality:**
- **Silver** (ocean-bright): EXCELLENT (prized for flavor, oiliness)
- **Red-bodied** (spawning): Still good (edible, slightly softer)

**Where to Find**: Rivers with lake systems (sockeye need lakes for juveniles), Bristol Bay, Kenai, Copper

**Fishing Technique**: Snagging (hook in body, legal in some areas during runs), fly fishing (small flies), nets

**Yield**: 2-4 lbs fillet per fish

**Survival Value**: HIGHEST (abundant during runs, easy to catch in large numbers, excellent preservation qualities)

---

### 3. Coho / Silver Salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*)

**Size**: 8-12 lbs (average), up to 20 lbs  
**Run Timing**: July-October (peak: August-September, latest run)  
**Best Harvest**: Late August-September

**Identification:**
- **Color**: Dark metallic blue back, bright silver sides
- **Spots**: Black spots on BACK, but only upper half of tail (not fully spotted like King)
- **Mouth**: White gums (distinguishes from King)
- **Tail**: Slightly forked

**Spawning Changes**: Males develop red sides, hooked jaw, body darkens

**Harvest Quality:**
- **Ocean-bright**: EXCELLENT (firm, pink-orange flesh)
- **Spawning**: Good (still firm, edible)

**Where to Find**: Smaller streams and rivers (compared to King), coastal areas, estuaries

**Fishing Technique**: Spinners, spoons, salmon eggs, fly fishing (aggressive biters)

**Yield**: 4-6 lbs fillet per fish

**Survival Value**: High (good size, abundant, fights hard so fun fishing morale boost)

---

### 4. Pink / Humpy Salmon (*Oncorhynchus gorbuscha*)

**Size**: 3-5 lbs (smallest salmon)  
**Run Timing**: July-August (even years MUCH larger runs in most Alaska rivers)  
**Best Harvest**: Mid-July

**Identification:**
- **Color**: Steel blue back, bright silver sides (ocean-bright)
- **Spots**: LARGE BLACK SPOTS on back and ENTIRE tail (heavily spotted)
- **Size**: Smallest salmon (easy to distinguish)

**Spawning Changes**: Males develop MASSIVE HUMP on back (hence "humpy"), hooked jaw, body turns olive/brown

**Harvest Quality:**
- **Ocean-bright**: Good (light pink flesh, low fat content)
- **Spawning/humped**: Poor (very soft, loses flavor rapidly, best used for dog food or smoking)

**Where to Find**: Coastal streams, small rivers (prefer short migration)

**Fishing Technique**: Small spinners, flies, easy to catch (abundant, not picky)

**Yield**: 1.5-2.5 lbs fillet per fish

**Survival Value**: Moderate (abundant in even years, but small size and low quality mean more work per pound)

---

### 5. Chum / Dog Salmon (*Oncorhynchus keta*)

**Size**: 8-15 lbs  
**Run Timing**: July-September  
**Best Harvest**: Late July-Early August

**Identification:**
- **Color**: Metallic greenish-blue back, silver sides (ocean-bright)
- **Spots**: NO distinct spots (or very faint)
- **Tail**: Deeply forked
- **Body**: Torpedo-shaped, stocky

**Spawning Changes**: Males develop VERTICAL TIGER STRIPES (purple/green), massive teeth, hooked jaw

**Harvest Quality:**
- **Ocean-bright**: GOOD (light pink flesh, lower fat than sockeye but decent)
- **Tiger-striped/spawning**: POOR (flesh becomes mushy, waterlogged, traditionally used for dog food)

**Where to Find**: Coastal rivers, lower sections of larger rivers

**Fishing Technique**: Green or purple flies, spinners, eggs (less aggressive than other salmon)

**Yield**: 4-6 lbs fillet per fish

**Survival Value**: Moderate (good size, but flesh quality declines rapidly in freshwater)

**Historical Note**: Called "dog salmon" because Alaska Natives traditionally dried chum to feed sled dogs (inferior eating quality compared to other species)

## 🎣 Salmon Fishing Tactics (Survival Context)

### Timing is Everything

**Best Strategy**: Position yourself at river mouth or lower river during peak run (July-August)

**Run Indicators:**
- Locals fishing (ask about timing)
- Fish jumping in river (visible salmon)
- Eagles/bears congregating (they know the schedule)

### Net Fishing (Most Efficient)

**Gear**:
- Gill net (50-100 feet, 6-inch mesh for salmon)
- Dip net (legal in some areas, personal use)

**Technique**:
- Set gill net across current (perpendicular to flow)
- Check every 2-4 hours (prevent spoilage, avoid bear attraction)
- Harvest 10-50 fish per day (during peak runs)

**Legal**: Check Alaska Dept of Fish & Game regulations (personal use permits available, subsistence rights vary)

### Rod & Reel (Lower Yield but Fun)

**Gear**:
- Heavy rod (salmon fight hard, 10-20 lb line)
- Lures: Spinners (silver/gold), spoons, salmon eggs

**Technique**:
- Cast into current, retrieve slowly
- Target deeper pools (salmon rest here)
- Fish early morning or evening (less pressure)

**Yield**: 2-10 fish per day (depending on run strength)

### Snagging (Legal in Some Areas)

**Technique**:
- Heavy weight, large treble hook
- Cast into school of salmon, yank to hook fish in body
- Legal during strong runs in designated areas

**Ethics**: Controversial (not "fair chase"), but effective in survival

**Season**: Year-round

**Fishing**: Small flies, worms, easy to catch

**Survival Value**: Low (small size, but abundant and easy to catch if desperate)

---

## 🐟 Char (Excellent Eating)

### Arctic Char (*Salvelinus alpinus*)

**Size**: 2-8 lbs (stream), up to 20 lbs (lake/ocean forms)

**Identification:**
- Light spots on dark background (like lake trout)
- Brilliant orange/red belly (especially in fall)
- Small mouth (compared to lake trout)

**Habitat**: Arctic rivers, lakes, coastal areas (northern Alaska)

**Season**: Year-round (fall spawning run = best eating)

**Fishing**: Flies, spinners, bait (similar to trout)

**Survival Value**: High (large size, excellent eating, abundant in Arctic)

### Dolly Varden (*Salvelinus malma*)

**Size**: 1-5 lbs (similar to rainbow trout)

**Identification:**
- Light spots on dark background
- Red/orange spots (more pronounced than Arctic char)
- Square tail (not forked)

**Habitat**: Coastal streams, rivers (throughout Alaska)

**Season**: Year-round (anadromous forms enter rivers in summer)

**Fishing**: Flies, spinners, salmon eggs (often caught incidentally while salmon fishing)

**Survival Value**: Moderate (good eating, but smaller than char/lake trout)

---

## 🐟 Grayling (Unique Alaska Species)

### Arctic Grayling (*Thymallus arcticus*)

- Small spinners
- Bait (salmon eggs, worms)

**Behavior**: Aggressive, easy to catch (great morale boost)

**Survival Value**: Moderate (small size, but delicious, easy to catch, abundant in right areas)

**Note**: Catch-and-release often encouraged (population pressure), but legal to harvest in survival

---

## 🐟 Pike (Underrated Survival Fish)

### Northern Pike (*Esox lucius*)

**Size**: 5-15 lbs (average), up to 30+ lbs

**Identification:**
- Long, torpedo-shaped body
- Greenish with light horizontal stripes/spots
- Duck-bill snout with MASSIVE TEETH (be careful handling)
- Dorsal and anal fins set far back (near tail)

**Habitat**: Shallow, weedy lakes and slow rivers (interior Alaska)

**Season**: Year-round (ice fishing productive)

**Fishing**:
- Spoons, spinners (flash attracts pike)
- Large plugs
- Dead bait (fish chunks)
- Ambush predator (cast near weeds, structures)

**Handling**: **CAUTION** - razor-sharp teeth (use pliers to remove hooks, not fingers)

**Survival Value**: HIGH (large size, aggressive eaters, abundant in right areas, available year-round)

**Preparation**: 
- Pike have Y-bones (small bones in fillet) - learn to remove or pickle (dissolves bones)
- Excellent smoked or fried
- Slightly "muddy" taste from weedy lakes (soak in saltwater to reduce)

---

## 🎣 Fishing Techniques by Context

### Survival (High Efficiency)

**Priority**: Maximum pounds of fish per hour of effort

**Tactics**:
1. **Net fishing during salmon runs** (50-200 lbs per day)
2. **Set lines** (multiple hooks, passive fishing)
3. **Fish traps** (weirs, stone traps in streams)
4. **Ice fishing** (winter, less energy expenditure than open water)

### Rod & Reel (Lower Yield, Morale Boost)

**When to Use**:
- No nets available
- Learning an area
- Maintaining morale (active, engaging)

**Tactics**:
- Target structure (logs, rocks, pools)
- Use natural bait (salmon eggs from spawned-out salmon)
- Fish dawn/dusk (most active feeding times)

## 📅 Seasonal Fishing Calendar (Interior Alaska)

| Month | Target Species | Method | Yield |
|-------|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Jan-Mar** | Lake trout, pike (ice) | Ice fishing, tip-ups | Moderate |
| **Apr-May** | Grayling, Dolly Varden | Fly fishing (ice-out) | Moderate |
| **Jun** | King salmon (early), grayling, trout | Rod/reel, flies | High (if salmon run) |
| **Jul** | ALL SALMON (peak), trout, char | Nets, rod/reel | **VERY HIGH** |
| **Aug** | Sockeye, coho, pink, trout | Nets, rod/reel | **VERY HIGH** |
| **Sep** | Coho (late), char (spawning), trout | Rod/reel | High |
| **Oct-Dec** | Lake trout, pike (ice-up) | Ice fishing | Moderate |

**Key Takeaway**: Focus efforts on July-August salmon runs (90% of your annual fish protein in 2 months)

## 🍽️ Field Preparation & Preservation

### Field Dressing Fish

**Immediately After Catch:**
1. **Bleed** (cut gills) - improves flavor, flesh quality
2. **Gut** (remove organs) - prevents spoilage (within 1-2 hours of catch)
3. **Cool** (stream, ice, shade) - keep below 40°F

**Gutting Steps:**
1. Insert knife at anus, cut toward head (belly up)
2. Remove organs (save roe if present, edible)
3. Scrape out kidney (dark red line along spine)
4. Rinse briefly (if clean water available)

**Time to Spoilage**:
- 32-40°F: 3-5 days (gutted)
- 40-50°F: 1-2 days
- 50°F+: 6-12 hours

### Preservation Methods (See l2-hunting-game-preservation-alaska.md)

**Smoking** (Best for Salmon):
- Hot smoke: 225°F, 4-6 hours (lasts 2-4 weeks)
- Cold smoke: 80-90°F, 24-48 hours (lasts weeks to months)

**Drying** (Jerky):
- Thin strips, salt cure, air dry 1-3 days

**Freezing** (Winter):
- Hang in cache (stays frozen naturally)

**Salting** (If No Fire):
- Pack in salt, layer by layer (lasts months)

**Final Thought**: Alaska is a fishing paradise, but timing is everything. One week of focused salmon fishing in July can provide 200+ pounds of protein (enough for months). 

**Learn to identify ocean-bright salmon** (best quality). **Target the sockeye and king runs** (highest fat, best preservation). **Don't neglect pike and char** (year-round backup).

**Fish when the fish are there.** Miss the runs, and you're working much harder for far less protein.
