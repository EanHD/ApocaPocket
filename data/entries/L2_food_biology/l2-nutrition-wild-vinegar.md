summary: 'Vinegar (acetic acid) is essential for food preservation (pickling), wound cleaning, and cooking. It''s made in two stages: fruit → alcohol (yeast fermentation), then alcohol → vinegar (acetobacter
  fermentation). Takes 3-8 weeks total. Any fruit with sugar works.'
warnings:
- Vinegar must reach 4-5% acidity for safe food preservation — taste-test for strong sourness. Weak vinegar does NOT safely preserve food.
- Keep fruit flies away during the first fermentation (they're welcome during the vinegar stage — they carry acetobacter)
- Methanol is not a concern in vinegar making — it converts to non-toxic compounds during acetic fermentation
- Botulism can grow in improperly acidified pickled foods — ensure vinegar is strong (pH below 4.6)
steps:
- 'FRUIT SELECTION: any sugary fruit works. Best: apples (classic), grapes, berries, pears, plums, peaches. Wild crabapples and elderberries are excellent. Overripe or bruised fruit is actually preferred
  — higher sugar content and more wild yeast present.'
- 'STAGE 1 — ALCOHOL: crush fruit and place in a wide-mouth container. Add water to cover (ratio ~1:1 fruit to water by volume). If fruit is not very sweet, add sugar or honey (2 tablespoons per quart of
  liquid). Cover with cloth (allows air, blocks insects). Wild yeast on the fruit skin starts fermentation naturally. Stir daily.'
- Fermentation takes 1-2 weeks. You'll see bubbles. When bubbling slows significantly, strain out fruit solids through cloth. You now have a weak wine/cider (~4-8% alcohol).
- 'STAGE 2 — VINEGAR: pour strained liquid into a wide container (wide opening = more air exposure = faster vinegar conversion). Cover with cloth. Store in warm (20-30°C) dark location. Acetobacter bacteria
  (naturally present in air and on fruit) convert alcohol to acetic acid.'
- A 'mother of vinegar' (gelatinous disc) will form on the surface — this is a living colony of acetobacter. Don't disturb it. If you have mother from a previous batch, add it to speed the process dramatically.
- 'TIMING: vinegar conversion takes 3-6 weeks. Taste weekly. It''s ready when it tastes sharply sour/acidic with no residual sweetness or alcohol taste.'
- 'TESTING STRENGTH: commercial vinegar is 5% acetic acid. Yours should taste at least as strong for preservation use. If too weak, continue fermenting. pH strips (if available): safe preservation requires
  pH below 4.6.'
- 'PASTEURIZE (optional, for storage): heat vinegar to 60-70°C (140-160°F) for 10 minutes. This kills the acetobacter and prevents further fermentation. If not pasteurized, store with the mother — it continues
  improving.'
- 'USES: food preservation (pickling vegetables — cover with vinegar + salt), wound cleaning (dilute 1:1 with water), descaling, cleaning, cooking (salad dressings, marinades), and as a general household
  acid. Vinegar is one of the most versatile homestead products.'

# Making Vinegar from Wild Fruit

Vinegar (acetic acid) is essential for food preservation (pickling), wound cleaning, and cooking. It's made in two stages: fruit → alcohol (yeast fermentation), then alcohol → vinegar (acetobacter fermentation). Takes 3-8 weeks total. Any fruit with sugar works.
