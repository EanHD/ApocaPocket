summary: 'Store water for emergencies or when municipal supply is unreliable. Clean food-grade containers, treat water before storage (bleach or boil), rotate every 6-12 months. Minimum 1 gallon per person
  per day for 3 days (emergency kit). Long-term: 30+ gallons per person.'
warnings:
- Non-food-grade containers (used for chemicals) contaminate water
- Algae grows in stored water if exposed to light - use opaque containers
- Stored water can harbor bacteria if not treated before storage
steps:
- 'CONTAINERS: Food-grade plastic (HDPE #2 or PET #1), glass, stainless steel. Clean thoroughly (bleach solution, rinse). Avoid containers that held chemicals, milk, juice (residue remains).'
- 'WATER TREATMENT BEFORE STORAGE: (1) Municipal tap water - no treatment needed (already chlorinated). (2) Well water or untreated source - boil 1 min, cool, then store. OR add bleach (8 drops unscented
  bleach per gallon, mix, wait 30 min).'
- 'FILLING: Fill containers to top (minimizes air, reduces bacterial growth). Seal tightly. Label with date.'
- 'STORAGE LOCATION: Cool, dark place. Avoid direct sunlight (promotes algae). Keep off concrete floor (chemicals can leach through plastic - use wood platform or shelf).'
- 'ROTATION: Replace stored water every 6-12 months. Use old water for plants, cleaning. Refill with fresh.'
- 'LONG-TERM BULK STORAGE: 55-gallon drums (food-grade). Water tanks (500+ gallons) for homesteads. Rainwater cisterns (filter and treat before use).'

# Water Storage — Clean Collection, Long-Term Storage, Rotation

Store water for emergencies or when municipal supply is unreliable. Clean food-grade containers, treat water before storage (bleach or boil), rotate every 6-12 months. Minimum 1 gallon per person per day for 3 days (emergency kit). Long-term: 30+ gallons per person.
