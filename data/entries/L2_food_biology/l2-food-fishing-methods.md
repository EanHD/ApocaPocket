summary: Multiple fishing methods increase success. Pole fishing (most common), nets (efficient for small fish), traps (passive), spears (requires skill). Use local bait (worms, insects, small fish).
warnings:
- Regulations vary - fishing may require license even in survival
- Some fish are toxic (pufferfish, certain tropical species) - research local species
- Fishing in polluted water produces contaminated fish
steps:
- 'POLE: Line, hook, bait. Cast into likely spots (near structure, shaded pools). Patience.'
- 'GILL NET: Net stretched across stream. Fish swim into it, gills caught in mesh. Passive, effective. Illegal in many areas.'
- 'FISH TRAP: Funnel-shaped basket or rock enclosure. Fish enter, cannot find exit. Set in stream, check daily.'
- 'SPEAR: Sharpened stick or multi-pronged spear. Wade in shallow water, strike fish. Aim low (refraction makes fish appear higher than actual position).'
- 'BAIT: Worms (dig in moist soil), insects (grasshoppers, beetles), small fish (minnows), meat scraps, dough balls.'
