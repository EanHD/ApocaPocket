# Throwing Stick (Rabbit Stick, Kylie) ⭐⭐⭐

**Level:** L2 (Intermediate)  
**Category:** Weapons & Hunting  
**Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate  
**Build Time:** 30 minutes to 1 hour  
**Effectiveness:** HIGH for small game (more effective than sling for rabbits)

## Why This Is Underrated

Modern people think "stick thrown at animal = primitive desperation." Dead wrong. The throwing stick is a **precision hunting tool** used globally for 40,000+ years. It's MORE effective than a sling for small game because the rotating stick creates a **larger strike zone** (18-24" blade sweeping through air vs. 2-4" stone). An expert can hit a running rabbit at 50 yards. Aboriginal Australians routinely killed kangaroos with throwing sticks. This isn't luck - it's physics and practice.

**The truth:** A well-made throwing stick is a ranged weapon that outperforms modern expectations. It's easier to make than a bow, easier to learn than a sling, and more effective than thrown rocks.

## Historical Context

- **Age:** 40,000+ years (Paleolithic cave art depicts thrown sticks)
- **Australian Aborigines:** Used "kylie" (curved throwing stick) to hunt kangaroos, emus, rabbits
- **Native Americans:** "Rabbit stick" used across North America (Hopi, Navajo, Apache)
- **Ancient Egypt:** Tomb paintings show hunters with throwing sticks (waterfowl hunting)
- **Global tool:** Every continent has indigenous throwing stick traditions
- **Not a boomerang:** Most throwing sticks DON'T return (boomerang is specialized variant)

**Why it persisted:** Throwing sticks were still used in Australia into the 20th century despite availability of firearms (that's how effective they are).

## How It Works

### Physics
- **Rotation:** Stick spins in flight (like helicopter blade)
- **Strike zone:** Rotating stick sweeps 18-24" diameter circle (much larger than stone)
- **Kinetic energy:** 8-16 oz stick at 40+ mph = bone-breaking force
- **Flat sides:** Create lift/stability (like airplane wing) - stick flies farther and flatter
- **Partial return:** Some designs return 10-30 feet (not full boomerang, but reduces retrieval distance)

**Why it's better than sling for small game:** You don't have to hit dead-center. ANY part of the spinning stick can strike the target.

## Construction

### Design Principles
- **Length:** 18-24" (elbow to fingertips is ideal)
- **Curve:** Slight banana curve (20-40° arc)
- **Weight:** 8-16 oz (balance between range and impact)
- **Thickness:** 1-1.5" at grip, tapers to ¾" at ends
- **Cross-section:** Flat on one side, rounded on other (creates aerodynamic lift)

### Wood Selection
- **Best:** Hardwood with natural curve (oak, hickory, mesquite, ironwood)
- **Good:** Straight-grained hardwood (carved to curve)
- **Avoid:** Softwood (pine, fir) - too light, breaks easily

**Pro tip:** Look for naturally curved branches (tree roots, junction branches)

### Build Instructions

1. **Select branch:**
   - Natural curve (slight banana shape)
   - 18-24" long, 1.5-2" diameter
   - No knots, cracks, or weak points

2. **Remove bark:**
   - Strip bark with knife
   - Sand or scrape smooth

3. **Shape cross-section:**
   - Carve one side FLAT (this is the "blade" side)
   - Keep other side rounded
   - Edges should be rounded (not sharp - prevents splitting)

4. **Weight distribution:**
   - Thicker/heavier at ONE end (this end leads in flight)
   - Grip end is lighter (easier to accelerate)
   - Balance point should be 1/3 from grip end

5. **Final touches:**
   - Sand smooth (splinters reduce aerodynamics)
   - Optional: Char in fire for hardness
   - Optional: Oil with animal fat (seals wood, prevents cracking)

6. **Test:**
   - Should spin smoothly when thrown
   - Flies flat (parallel to ground)
   - Travels 40-60 yards with moderate effort

### Advanced: Adjusting Flight Characteristics

- **More return:** Increase curve, flatten blade more
- **More distance:** Reduce curve, make thinner
- **More impact:** Make heavier, thicker at leading edge

## Throwing Techniques

### Sidearm Throw (Primary)
1. **Grip:** Hold grip end (lighter end) like shaking hands
2. **Stance:** Sideways to target, feet shoulder-width
3. **Windup:** Bring stick back past hip (keep horizontal)
4. **Throw:** Snap arm forward, release with wrist flick
5. **Spin:** Stick should spin rapidly (like frisbee)
6. **Angle:** Release parallel to ground (stick flies flat)

**Best for:** 30-60 yards, maximum accuracy

### Overhand Throw (Close Range)
1. **Grip:** Same as sidearm
2. **Windup:** Bring stick back past shoulder (vertical plane)
3. **Throw:** Overhead motion (like throwing a tomahawk)
4. **Release:** Stick rotates end-over-end (not flat spin)
5. **Impact:** Leading edge strikes with full weight

**Best for:** 10-30 yards, thick brush, quick shots

### Underhand Throw (Stealth)
1. **Grip:** Hold at balance point
2. **Windup:** Minimal (pendulum swing between legs)
3. **Throw:** Upward snap (stick spins horizontally)
4. **Flight:** Low trajectory (under tree branches)

**Best for:** Dense cover, quick deployment, silent approach

## Hunting Applications

### Small Game (Primary Use)
- **Rabbits:** 30-50 yards, aim for running rabbit's path (lead target)
- **Squirrels:** 20-40 yards, throw when squirrel pauses (easier than moving target)
- **Prairie dogs:** 30-50 yards, high success rate (colonial animals, multiple targets)
- **Marmots/groundhogs:** 20-40 yards, good impact (heavy-bodied animals)

### Birds
- **Ground birds:** Grouse, quail, pheasant (when flushed, throw into flight path)
- **Waterfowl:** Ducks, geese (sitting on water or ground)
- **Success rate:** Lower than small game (birds are faster, smaller)

### Techniques
- **Running game:** Lead target by 3-5 feet (stick takes time to travel)
- **Sitting game:** Aim directly at head/body (no lead needed)
- **Multiple throws:** Carry 2-3 sticks (follow-up shots without retrieval)
- **Pack hunting:** Group of hunters throws multiple sticks (overwhelming target)

## Advantages Over Other Tools

### Vs. Sling
1. **Larger strike zone:** 18-24" rotating stick vs 2-4" stone
2. **Easier accuracy:** Don't need pinpoint aim (anywhere on rotation arc hits)
3. **Learning curve:** 5-10 hours (throwing stick) vs 20+ hours (sling)
4. **Visibility:** Can see stick in flight (adjust future throws)

### Vs. Bow
1. **Construction time:** 30 min (stick) vs 10-20 hours (bow)
2. **Simplicity:** No arrows, no string, no maintenance
3. **Carrying:** Slip in belt, carry 3-4 sticks vs 1 bow + 6 arrows

### Vs. Atlatl
1. **Speed:** Instant deployment (no dart loading)
2. **Brush:** Works in thick cover (short weapon)
3. **Retrieval:** See where stick lands (darts hard to find)

## Modern Applications

### Survival Hunting
- **When ammunition gone:** Throwing stick works indefinitely
- **Improvised weapon:** Make in 30 minutes from any hardwood
- **Backup:** Carry throwing stick as secondary weapon (lightweight)

### Pest Control
- **Rabbits:** Agricultural pest control (no poison, no traps)
- **Rodents:** Ground squirrels, prairie dogs (range-based control)
- **Birds:** Deterrent (scare birds without killing)

### Recreation
- **Sport throwing:** Competitions in Australia (distance and accuracy)
- **Practice tool:** Develops hand-eye coordination, range estimation

## Safety Warnings

### Critical Dangers
- **Backstop:** Sticks travel 60+ yards (clear area behind target)
- **Rebound:** Hardwood sticks bounce off trees, rocks (ricochets dangerous)
- **Spectators:** 50-foot clearance on all sides (spinning stick unpredictable)

### Injury Risks
- **Self-injury:** Improper release = stick flies backward or sideways
- **Impact force:** 12 oz at 40 mph = broken bones (humans, pets)
- **Sharp edges:** If sharpened (not recommended), can cause lacerations

### Practice Safety
- **Open area:** Field, beach, desert (no people, structures, or animals nearby)
- **Inspection:** Check for cracks before EVERY throw (failure mid-flight = uncontrolled tumble)
- **Start close:** Practice at 15 feet before progressing to distance

## Legal Considerations

### United States
- **Generally legal:** No federal restrictions (classified as primitive tool)
- **State laws:** No states specifically prohibit throwing sticks
- **Hunting regulations:** NOT legal for hunting in most states (not listed as approved method)
- **Urban use:** May violate "reckless endangerment" if thrown near people/property

### Hunting Legality
- **Survival situations:** Emergency use typically allowed
- **Tribal lands:** Some reservations permit traditional methods
- **Private property:** Legal with landowner permission (pest control)

### Self-Defense
- **Club classification:** If used as weapon, legally equivalent to club/baton
- **Justified use:** Must meet same standards as other impact weapons
- **Lethal force:** Courts have ruled throwing sticks CAN be deadly weapons

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Stick tumbles in flight
- **Cause:** Unbalanced weight, improper release, or warped wood
- **Fix:** Re-carve to balance weight, practice wrist snap, straighten over steam

### Problem: Flies short distance
- **Cause:** Too heavy, not enough spin, or rough surface
- **Fix:** Carve thinner/lighter, increase wrist snap, sand smooth

### Problem: Inconsistent flight
- **Cause:** Irregular shape, off-center weight, or variable release
- **Fix:** Check symmetry, re-balance, practice consistent grip

### Problem: Returns too much (hits thrower)
- **Cause:** Too much curve, too flat (like boomerang)
- **Fix:** Reduce curve, round off flat side slightly

## Final Notes

The throwing stick is the most underrated hunting tool in history. It's easier to make than a bow, easier to learn than a sling, and MORE effective than rocks for small game. The rotating blade creates a huge strike zone - you don't need perfect aim, just "close enough."

In a survival scenario, you can make a throwing stick in 30 minutes and be hunting rabbits by sundown. No arrows to lose, no string to break, no ammunition to run out. Just a curved stick and your arm.

**Historical perspective:** If Aboriginal Australians hunted kangaroos (50+ lb animals, fast runners) with throwing sticks, you can hunt rabbits. The tool works. The physics are sound. Don't underestimate a "stick."
