summary: Poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) and water hemlock (Cicuta species) are among the most deadly plants in North America and Europe. Both are easily confused with edible plants like wild carrot, parsnip, and parsley. A single mistake can be FATAL. Learn these identification features before foraging ANY wild umbellifers.
warnings:
- DEADLY - Both hemlocks can kill an adult within hours
- Water hemlock is considered the most violently toxic plant in North America
- NO ANTIDOTE - Treatment is supportive only
- ALL PARTS are toxic, including roots, stems, leaves, seeds, and flowers
- Toxins can absorb through skin - wear gloves when handling for identification
- Children are at extreme risk - smaller body mass means faster death
- Do NOT confuse with wild carrot, parsnip, wild chervil, or other edible umbellifers

steps:
- 'POISON HEMLOCK (Conium maculatum) IDENTIFICATION: HEIGHT: 4-10 feet tall biennial. STEM: Smooth, hollow, with PURPLE/RED BLOTCHES or streaks (key feature). Hairless. LEAVES: Fern-like, triangular outline, finely divided (looks like parsley). Dark green, hairless. FLOWERS: Small white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters (umbels), 2-3 inches across, June-August. SMELL: Strong mousy/musty urine odor when crushed (very unpleasant). ROOTS: White taproot. HABITAT: Roadsides, disturbed areas, waste ground, stream banks. TOXIN: Coniine (alkaloid) - causes paralysis, respiratory failure.'
- 'WATER HEMLOCK (Cicuta species - C. douglasii, C. maculata) IDENTIFICATION: HEIGHT: 3-6 feet tall perennial. STEM: Green to purple, smooth, hollow, with VERTICAL CHAMBERS (when cut lengthwise). LEAVES: 2-3 times pinnately compound, lance-shaped leaflets with SHARP TEETH pointing forward. Veins end at NOTCHES between teeth (NOT at tips). FLOWERS: White, umbrella-shaped clusters (umbels), June-September. SMELL: Musty carrot-like when crushed. ROOTS: CHAMBERED TUBERS - when cut shows HORIZONTAL CHAMBERS with yellow oily liquid (cicutoxin). Most toxic part. HABITAT: Wet areas, stream banks, marshes, ditches.'
- 'DEADLY LOOKALIKES COMPARISON - Wild Carrot (Queen Annes Lace): SAFE but MUST distinguish. STEM: Hairy, solid, GREEN with no purple. ONE CENTRAL PURPLE/DARK FLOWER in center of umbel. SMELL: Carrot scent. ROOT: Smells like carrot. Wild Parsnip: YELLOW flowers (hemlock is white). Stem is NOT purple-blotched. Can cause phototoxic burns but not deadly.'
- 'SYMPTOMS OF HEMLOCK POISONING: POISON HEMLOCK (30-180 min onset): Trembling, salivation, dilated pupils, weak pulse, paralysis starting in legs moving upward, respiratory paralysis, death. Victim remains CONSCIOUS until the end. WATER HEMLOCK (15-90 min onset): Salivation, nausea, violent seizures within 15 minutes, respiratory failure. Most violently toxic - seizures can be so severe they cause rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown).'
- 'FIELD TREATMENT: NO ANTIDOTE. Call emergency services immediately. If conscious and recent ingestion (within 30 min): induce vomiting or give activated charcoal (1g per kg body weight). Protect airway during seizures. Provide rescue breathing if breathing stops. Keep patient calm and still. Time is critical - minutes matter.'
- 'SAFE FORAGING RULES: NEVER harvest any wild umbellifer (carrot family) unless you are 100% certain. Check ALL features: stem (hairy vs smooth, purple blotches), smell (carrot vs mousy), habitat. When in doubt, throw it out. Learn these BEFORE foraging wild carrots.'
- 'REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION: Poison Hemlock: Throughout North America (introduced from Europe), especially Pacific Northwest, California, eastern states. Europe and temperate zones worldwide. Water Hemlock: Native to North America - all wet areas throughout the continent. C. douglasii (Western), C. maculata (Eastern).'

# Poison Hemlock & Water Hemlock — DEADLY Identification

Poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) and water hemlock (Cicuta species) are among the most deadly plants in North America and Europe. Both are easily confused with edible plants like wild carrot, parsnip, and parsley. A single mistake can be FATAL. Learn these identification features before foraging ANY wild umbellifers.

## Step-by-step Identification

### POISON HEMLOCK (Conium maculatum)
**Critical Features:**
- **HEIGHT:** 4-10 feet tall biennial
- **STEM:** Smooth, hollow, with **PURPLE/RED BLOTCHES** or streaks (KEY FEATURE). Hairless
- **LEAVES:** Fern-like, triangular outline, finely divided (looks like parsley). Dark green, hairless
- **FLOWERS:** Small white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters (umbels), 2-3 inches across, June-August
- **SMELL:** Strong mousy/musty urine odor when crushed (very unpleasant)
- **ROOTS:** White taproot
- **HABITAT:** Roadsides, disturbed areas, waste ground, stream banks
- **TOXIN:** Coniine (alkaloid) - causes paralysis, respiratory failure

### WATER HEMLOCK (Cicuta species)
**Critical Features:**
- **HEIGHT:** 3-6 feet tall perennial
- **STEM:** Green to purple, smooth, hollow, with VERTICAL CHAMBERS (when cut lengthwise)
- **LEAVES:** 2-3 times pinnately compound, lance-shaped leaflets with SHARP TEETH pointing forward. Veins end at NOTCHES between teeth (NOT at tips)
- **FLOWERS:** White, umbrella-shaped clusters (umbels), June-September
- **SMELL:** Musty carrot-like when crushed
- **ROOTS:** **CHAMBERED TUBERS** - when cut shows HORIZONTAL CHAMBERS with yellow oily liquid (cicutoxin). Most toxic part
- **HABITAT:** Wet areas, stream banks, marshes, ditches

### SAFE LOOKALIKES COMPARISON

**Wild Carrot (Queen Anne's Lace) - SAFE:**
- **STEM:** Hairy, solid, GREEN (no purple blotches)
- **FLOWER:** ONE CENTRAL PURPLE/DARK FLOWER in center of white umbel
- **SMELL:** Distinct carrot scent
- **ROOT:** Smells like carrot, taproot

**Wild Parsnip:**
- **FLOWERS:** YELLOW (hemlock is white)
- **STEM:** Not purple-blotched
- Note: Can cause phototoxic burns but not deadly

## Symptoms of Hemlock Poisoning

**POISON HEMLOCK (30-180 minute onset):**
- Trembling, salivation, dilated pupils
- Weak pulse, loss of coordination
- Paralysis starting in legs, moving upward
- Respiratory paralysis, death
- Victim remains CONSCIOUS until the end (terrifying)

**WATER HEMLOCK (15-90 minute onset):**
- Salivation, nausea
- VIOLENT SEIZURES within 15 minutes
- Respiratory failure
- Most violently toxic plant in North America
- Seizures can cause rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)

## Field Treatment
- **NO ANTIDOTE EXISTS**
- Call emergency services immediately
- If conscious and recent ingestion (&lt;30 min): induce vomiting or activated charcoal (1g per kg)
- Protect airway during seizures
- Provide rescue breathing if breathing stops
- Keep patient calm and still
- **TIME IS CRITICAL** - minutes matter

## Safe Foraging Rules
1. **NEVER** harvest any wild umbellifer (carrot family) unless you are 100% certain
2. Check ALL features: stem (hairy vs smooth, purple blotches), smell (carrot vs mousy), habitat
3. **When in doubt, throw it out**
4. Learn these identification features BEFORE foraging wild carrots

## Warnings
- **DEADLY** - Both hemlocks can kill an adult within hours
- Water hemlock is the most violently toxic plant in North America
- **NO ANTIDOTE** - Treatment is supportive only
- ALL PARTS toxic, including roots, stems, leaves, seeds, flowers
- Toxins can absorb through skin - wear gloves when handling
