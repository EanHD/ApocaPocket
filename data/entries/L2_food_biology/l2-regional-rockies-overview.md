## Key Plant Resources

### Edible Plants (by season & elevation)

| Plant | Season | Elevation | Parts Used | Calories/lb | Preparation | Cross-ref |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Pine nuts (pinyon, whitebark) | Sep-Oct | 6,000-10,000 ft | Seeds (cones) | 3000+ | Extract from cones, roast, high fat | l1-pine-nuts.md |
| Wild berries (raspberry, huckleberry, elderberry) | Jul-Aug | 7,000-10,000 ft | Fruit | 250-350 | Fresh, dry | l1-wild-berries.md |
| Aspen inner bark | Year-round (emergency) | 7,000-10,000 ft | Cambium | 400-500 | Peel outer bark, scrape inner (survival food) | l1-survival-trees.md |
| Dandelion | Jun-Aug | Below 10,000 ft | Leaves, roots | 200-300 | Leaves raw/cooked | l1-common-weeds.md |
| Wild onion | Jun-Sep | Below 11,000 ft | Bulb | 150-200 | Raw/cooked | l1-foraging-basics.md |
| Yampa root | Jul-Sep | Meadows | Root | 400-500 | Dig root, cook like potato (Native American staple) | l2-mountain-roots.md |

| Rose hips | Aug-Oct | Below 10,000 ft | Fruit | 150-200 | High vitamin C, tea or eat raw | l1-wild-fruits.md |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Short growing season (June-August). Pine nuts are MOST calorie-dense, priority harvest.

---

### Seasonal Foraging Strategy

**Summer (June-August) - ONLY GROWING SEASON**
- **Berry harvest (critical):** Raspberry, huckleberry, thimbleberry, serviceberry
  - Peak: July-August
  - Dry for winter (high elevation = low humidity, sun-drying effective)
- **Pine nut scouting:** Check cones forming (harvest in fall)
- **Roots:** Yampa, biscuitroot (high elevation meadows)
- **Greens:** Dandelion, fireweed shoots (early summer)

**Fall (September-October)**
- **PINE NUT HARVEST:** Before squirrels take them all
  - Whitebark pine (high elevation, 8,000-11,000 ft)
  - Pinyon pine (lower elevation, 6,000-8,000 ft)
  - Collect cones, extract seeds, store (winter calories)
- **Late berries:** Rose hips (after frost, sweeter)
- **Last foraging before winter** (snow arrives September-October)

**Winter (November-May)**
- **NO FORAGING:** Everything frozen, buried under snow
- **Inner bark (emergency only):** Aspen, pine (low nutrition, hard to harvest)
- **Rely on stored foods:** Pine nuts, dried berries, dried meat

**Spring (May-June)**
- **Slow start:** Snow still deep at elevation
- **Early greens:** Dandelion (as soon as snow melts), glacier lily (Native American use)
- **Anticipate summer:** Plan foraging locations

---

### Toxic Look-alikes

**DEADLY - Water Hemlock (*Cicuta*)**
- Looks like yampa root, wild carrot, parsnip
- **Most poisonous plant in North America**
- Causes violent seizures, death in hours
- Positive ID critical (smell like parsnip when cut, chambered root)

**Death Camas (*Zigadenus*):**
- Looks like wild onion (but no onion smell)
- Causes vomiting, seizures, death
- **Test:** Crush leaf - if no onion smell, DO NOT EAT

**False Hellebore (*Veratrum*):**
- Large, broad leaves (early spring)
- Causes vomiting, heart problems
- Avoid any plant that doesn't positively ID

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Yampa vs water hemlock comparison, pine nut cone identification, edible vs toxic root plants.

---

### Non-food Plant Uses
- **Aspen bark:** Fire tinder (even when wet, contains flammable oils)
- **Pine resin:** Waterproofing, adhesive, fire starter, antiseptic
- **Willow bark:** Pain relief (salicin - aspirin), grows near water
- **Spruce/fir boughs:** Bedding, insulation, shelter roofing
- **Bark (various):** Containers, cordage (inner bark twisted)

## Key Animal Resources

### Large Game

| Animal | Weight | Season | Habitat | Hunting Notes | Yield (lbs meat) |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Elk | 500-800 lbs | Sep-Oct | Montane forests, meadows | Bugling (rut), high-altitude | 200-350 |
| Mule deer | 150-300 lbs | Sep-Nov | Montane/subalpine | Migrate to lower elevations in winter | 60-120 |
| Bighorn sheep | 150-300 lbs | Sep-Oct (limited permits) | Alpine cliffs, high ridges | Rare, protected, excellent meat | 60-120 |
| Mountain goat | 150-300 lbs | Sep-Oct (limited permits) | Alpine zone, cliffs | Dangerous terrain, sure-footed | 60-120 |
| Moose | 800-1200 lbs | Sep-Oct (limited areas) | Wetlands, willow thickets (northern Rockies) | Massive yield, dangerous in rut | 400-600 |

**Elk:** PRIMARY GAME
- Herds (100+ animals possible)
- September rut (bugling, bulls aggressive, less cautious)
- Migrate to lower elevations in winter (follow them down)
- One elk = 250-350 lbs meat (feeds family for months)

**Mule Deer:**
- Widespread, adaptable
- Bounding gait ("stotting," all four legs at once)
- Large ears (namesake)

**Bighorn Sheep & Mountain Goats:**
- Specialized high-altitude animals
- Rarely hunted (limited permits, difficult access)
- Live on cliffs (safety from predators)

---

### Small Game & Birds
- **Ptarmigan (white-tailed, rock):** Alpine zone, Sep-Apr, camouflage (white in winter, mottled in summer)
- **Grouse (blue, ruffed):** Forests, Sep-Feb, challenging hunt, excellent eating
- **Marmot (yellow-bellied):** Alpine, summer only (hibernate Oct-Apr), edible but small (3-8 lbs)
- **Pika:** Alpine (hay maker), very small (<1 lb), not worth effort
- **Squirrel (red, Abert's):** Forests, Sep-Feb, 1-2 lbs meat
- **Rabbit (snowshoe hare, cottontail):** Forests, Oct-Feb, 2-3 lbs meat
- **Duck/waterfowl:** Alpine lakes (summer), marsh areas (lower elevations)

---

### Fish (Cold Water Species)

**Mountain Streams:**
| Species | Size | Season | Method | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Trout (cutthroat, brook, rainbow, brown) | 6"-16" | Jun-Oct | Fly, spinner, worms | Native + stocked, excellent eating, freeze solid in winter |
| Grayling (arctic) | 8"-14" | Jun-Sep | Fly | Rare, northern Rockies only, beautiful fish |

**Alpine Lakes:**
| Species | Size | Season | Method | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Trout (cutthroat, golden) | 6"-18" | Jun-Oct | Fly, spinner | High elevation, crystal-clear water, golden trout rare |

**Lowland Rivers (below 7,000 ft):**
- **Trout:** Larger (12-20"), year-round (but harder in winter)
- **Whitefish (mountain):** 10-18", year-round, underrated eating

**Ice Fishing:** Possible on frozen lakes (Dec-Apr), but EXTREME COLD, altitude makes it challenging

---

### Dangerous Animals (see l2-regional-rockies-hazards.md)
- **Grizzly bears:** Northern Rockies (MT, WY), aggressive, MANDATORY bear spray
- **Black bears:** All Rockies, less aggressive than grizzlies but still dangerous
- **Mountain lions:** Ambush predators, rare but present, attacks rare
- **Rattlesnakes:** Lower elevations (<8,000 ft), warmer months
- **Moose:** Northern Rockies, aggressive during rut and with calves

---

## Water Sources & Purification

### Water Availability (Altitude & Season-Dependent)

**Summer (June-August):**
- **Abundant:** Snowmelt streams, alpine lakes, tarns
- **Quality:** BEST in US (cold, high-altitude, low bacteria)
- **Temperature:** 35-50°F (glacial melt, bone-chilling)
- **Concern:** Giardia (from animals), but lower risk than lower elevations

**Fall (September-October):**
- **Decreasing:** Snowmelt tapering off, some streams dry up
- **Quality:** Excellent (cold temperatures)
- **Strategy:** Camp near reliable water (larger streams, lakes)

**Winter (November-May):**
- **FROZEN:** All surface water ice-covered or frozen solid
- **Streams:** Some flow under ice, hard to access
- **Snow/ice:** ONLY source (melt required)
- **Energy cost:** Extreme (melt 10:1 ratio, at altitude, in extreme cold)

**Spring (May-June):**
- **Snowmelt runoff:** Maximum flow, turbid (silt from glaciers)
- **Quality:** Good (cold) but silty
- **Flooding:** Mountain valleys can flood rapidly

---

### Altitude Effects on Water

**Boiling Point Decreases with Altitude:**
| Elevation | Boiling Point | Boil Time (Purification) |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Sea level | 212°F | 1 minute |
| 5,000 ft | 203°F | 2 minutes |
| 7,500 ft | 198°F | 3 minutes |
| 10,000 ft | 194°F | 3-4 minutes |
| 14,000 ft | 187°F | 5 minutes |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** At high altitude, boil 3-5 minutes (not 1 minute).

---

### Water Purification Methods

**Priority:**
1. **Boil:** Most reliable (but longer at altitude, fuel-intensive)
2. **Filter:** 0.2-micron (removes bacteria, parasites, NOT viruses - but viruses rare in backcountry)
3. **Chemical:** Iodine/chlorine (COLD water slows effectiveness - need longer wait time)
   - 35°F water = 60+ minutes wait time (vs 30 minutes at 70°F)

**Cold Water Issue:**
- Iodine/chlorine reactions slow in cold water
- Warm water in clothing before treating (if possible)
- Use filter + boil (most reliable)

**Glacial Silt:**
- Milky-white water (fine rock particles suspended)
- Clogs filters rapidly
- Let settle overnight (particles sink)
- Pour off clear water from top

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Boiling point by altitude chart, water source selection flowchart, glacial silt settling technique.

---

## Shelter Construction

### Altitude Considerations
- **Thin air:** Harder to breathe, work (everything takes 2x-3x longer)
- **Wind:** Extreme above treeline (sustained 50+ mph common)
- **Cold:** -20°F to -40°F winter, even summer nights below freezing at altitude
- **UV exposure:** 50% more intense than sea level (sunburn, snow blindness)
- **Weather changes:** Rapid (blizzard in 30 minutes)

---

### Shelter Types by Elevation

#### Montane Shelter (6,000-9,000 ft) - Below Treeline
```
Design: Log cabin or timber-frame structure
- Materials: Lodgepole pine, spruce, fir (abundant, straight)
- Walls: 8-12 inch diameter logs, chinked with moss/mud
- Roof: Steep pitch (45°+), support 4-6 ft snow load
- Insulation: R-40+ (double walls with pine needle/moss fill)
- Heat source: Wood stove or stone fireplace (CRITICAL)
- Size: Small (10x12 ft for 1-2 people, easier to heat)
- Wind protection: Trees provide windbreak, but avoid "widow-makers" (dead standing trees)
```

**Advantages:**
- Timber available
- Less extreme than higher elevations
- Easier to breathe, work

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Log cabin construction (notching techniques), steep roof snow-shedding design.

---

#### Subalpine Shelter (9,000-11,500 ft) - Treeline
```
Design: Semi-underground or heavily insulated structure
- Location: BELOW treeline (krummholz provides some windbreak)
- Construction: Dig into hillside (earth insulation), timber front wall
- Roof: Low profile (wind resistance), thick insulation, snow load capacity
- Entrance: Below sleeping area (cold air sinks)
- Heat: Wood stove (wood available but smaller, windblown, harder to harvest)
- Ventilation: CRITICAL (CO risk, but lose heat)
```

**Challenges:**
- Thinner air (hard to work)
- Shorter summer (June-August construction window)
- Wind (constant, erodes structures)
- Limited large timber (stunted trees)

---

#### Alpine Shelter (11,500+ ft) - Above Treeline
**DO NOT PLAN TO SURVIVE HERE LONG-TERM**

**Emergency Only:**

**Snow Cave (Winter):**
```
- Dig into snowdrift/cornice (6+ ft deep snow)
- Excavate chamber (6x8 ft)
- Sleeping platform raised above entrance
- Ventilation hole CRITICAL
- Block entrance with snow
- Interior: 20-35°F (vs -40°F outside)
- Time: 2-4 hours to build (exhausting at altitude)
```

**Rock Shelter (Summer):**
```
- Find boulder overhang or cliff alcove
- Windbreak wall (stacked rocks)
- NO fire materials (above treeline)
- Ground insulation critical (rock sucks heat)
- Emergency only (hypothermia risk)
```

---

### Insulation Materials (Altitude-Specific)

**Best to Worst:**
1. **Pine needles:** R-1.5 per inch, abundant below 10,000 ft, dry well
2. **Spruce/fir boughs:** R-1 per inch, aromatic, good layering
3. **Dry grasses:** R-1.5 per inch (alpine meadows, limited availability)
4. **Moss:** R-0.5 per inch (damp, must dry thoroughly)
5. **Snow:** R-1 per inch (once shelter built, adds insulation)

**Critical:** At altitude, materials are LIMITED. Plan insulation harvest before winter.

---

### Shelter Location Selection (CRITICAL)

**Avalanche Terrain (AVOID):**
- Slopes 30-45° (avalanche zone)
- Below cornices (snow overhangs on ridges)
- Valley bottoms below steep slopes
- See l2-regional-rockies-hazards.md for avalanche details

**Good Locations:**
- Ridge tops (no avalanche danger, but EXTREME wind)
- Gentle slopes <25° (below treeline if possible)
- Dense timber (avalanche protection, windbreak)
- South-facing (more sun, warmer)
- Near reliable water (but not in flood zone)

**Bad Locations:**
- Valley bottoms (cold air sinks, inversion = colder than peaks)
- Under cliffs (rockfall, cornices)
- Near dead standing trees (widow-makers fall in wind/snow)
- Flood zones (snowmelt flash floods)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Avalanche terrain identification (slope angles), safe vs dangerous camp locations.

---

## Fire Making & Management

### Altitude Effects on Fire
- **Thinner air = Less oxygen = Harder to start/maintain fire**
- **Wood burns differently:**
  - At 10,000 ft: 30% less oxygen than sea level
  - Fire requires MORE fuel, MORE airflow
  - Coals burn cooler, less efficiently

---

### Wood Selection (Altitude-Specific)

| Wood Type | Elevation | BTU/cord | Burn Rate | Availability | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Ponderosa pine | 6,000-8,000 ft | 17-19M | Fast | Common | Lower elevations, resinous |
| Lodgepole pine | 7,000-10,000 ft | 15-17M | Fast | Very common | Straight, thin, easy to harvest |
| Douglas fir | 6,000-9,000 ft | 20-22M | Moderate | Common | Good heating wood |
| Engelmann spruce | 9,000-11,500 ft | 15-17M | Fast | Common (high) | High elevation, smaller |
| Subalpine fir | 9,000-11,500 ft | 14-16M | Fast | Common (high) | High elevation, resinous |
| Aspen | 7,000-10,000 ft | 14-16M | Fast | Common (groves) | Splits easily, burns hot but fast |
| Limber pine | 9,000-12,000 ft | 18-20M | Moderate | Treeline | Stunted, windblown, hard to harvest |

**Best for altitude:** Ponderosa, Douglas fir (lower elevations, higher BTU)  
**Reality at high elevations:** Lodgepole, spruce, fir (all you have, lower BTU)

---

### Fire Starting (Altitude Challenges)

**Tinder (Altitude-Specific):**
1. **Pine resin (pitch):** Best fire starter at any altitude (even wet, cold)
2. **Dry pine needles:** Under trees, protected from snow
3. **Aspen bark (inner):** Flammable oils, shred finely
4. **Dry grasses:** Alpine meadows, limited availability
5. **Birch bark:** Rare in Rockies (exists in northern areas)

**Technique at Altitude:**
- **More tinder needed:** Thin air = fire harder to start
- **More kindling needed:** Fire spreads slower
- **More airflow:** Fan fire (carefully), position for wind assistance
- **Patience:** Takes longer to establish at 10,000 ft+ vs sea level

---

### Firewood Requirements (Altitude & Cold)

**Winter (November-May):**
- **Consumption:** 0.5-1 cord per month (6-month winter = 3-6 cords minimum)
- **Higher at altitude:** Colder temps, less efficient burning
- **Harvest window:** Summer-early fall (before snow buries deadfall)

**Daily Routine (Winter):**
```
Dawn: Revive coals (add tinder, kindling)
Morning: Load stove (3-4 hour burn)
Midday: Reload
Afternoon: Reload
Evening: Bank fire (large splits, damper down)
Overnight: Smoldering coals (restart in morning)
```

**Banking Fire (Overnight):**
- Thick coal bed (1-2 hours hot fire)
- Largest splits (6-10 inch diameter)
- Pack tightly (reduce oxygen)
- Damper down (not fully closed - need some draft)
- Result: Coals remain in morning

---

### Fire Safety (Altitude-Specific)

**Carbon Monoxide (CO) - EXTREME DANGER:**
- **Altitude = less oxygen = incomplete combustion = MORE CO**
- Symptoms same as altitude sickness (headache, nausea, confusion)
- **Prevention:**
  - ALWAYS have chimney/vent
  - Crack window for fresh air intake
  - CO detector (battery-powered)
- **If headache develops:** Get outside immediately, check for CO source

**Lightning Strikes:**
- Afternoon thunderstorms (daily in summer)
- Tall trees, high points = strike targets
- Keep fire away from tallest trees
- Have fire starter kit protected (in case primary fire struck)

**Forest Fires:**
- Dry conditions (low humidity at altitude)
- Ponderosa pine forests = high fire risk
- Contain fire (fire ring, clear area)
- Never leave fire unattended in summer

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Fire lay types for altitude (modified for thin air), CO detector placement, lightning-safe fire location.

---

## Seasonal Survival Strategies

### Summer (June-August) - SHORT WINDOW

**Advantages:**
- **Only growing season:** Forage, hunt, build, prepare
- Long daylight (15+ hours at northern latitudes)
- Temperatures moderate (60-80°F days, but freezing nights possible)
- **Access:** Snow melted, trails passable
- Wildlife abundant (elk in high meadows, trout active)

**Challenges:**
- **Afternoon thunderstorms:** DAILY (lightning, hail, flash floods)
- **Short season:** 10-12 weeks total (lower elevations: 14-16 weeks)
- Altitude sickness (see hazards)
- Intense UV (sunburn, snow blindness even in summer)
- Thin air (exhaustion, work takes 2x-3x longer)

**Priorities:**
1. **Forage berries:** July-August (dry for winter)
2. **Scout pine nut cones:** Prepare for fall harvest
3. **Hunt/fish:** Preserve meat (smoke, dry - low humidity = easier)
4. **Build/repair shelter:** BEFORE snow (September+)
5. **Firewood:** Harvest 5+ cords (6-month winter)
6. **Insulation:** Gather materials (pine needles, boughs - must dry)
7. **Water source:** Identify reliable winter source

**Rule: "Summer is for winter prep."** No time to relax.

---

### Fall (September-October) - PREPARATION DEADLINE

**Advantages:**
- **Pine nut harvest:** Critical winter calories
- Elk hunting (rut, bugling, easier to locate)
- Cooler temps (50-70°F, comfortable work weather)
- Aspen gold (beautiful, but signals winter coming)
- Clear skies (less storm risk than summer)

**Challenges:**
- **First snow:** Can hit ANYTIME (September blizzards common)
- Rapidly shortening days (14 → 10 hours)
- Temperature swings (70°F day, 20°F night)
- **Deadline pressure:** If not ready by early October, you're in trouble

**Priorities:**
1. **PINE NUT HARVEST (CRITICAL):** Collect cones, extract nuts, store (may be 50% of winter calories)
2. **Elk hunting:** September rut = prime time (one elk = 3+ months meat)
3. **Final firewood:** Complete 5-6 cord stockpile
4. **Shelter winterization:**
   - Final insulation (pack all gaps)
   - Roof inspection (4-6 ft snow load coming)
   - Storm shutters (protect windows)
   - Snow stakes (mark shelter location in deep snow)
5. **Last foraging:** Rose hips (after frost)
6. **Move to lower elevation (if high-altitude):** Above 10,000 ft = death trap in winter

**Rule: "First snow is a warning. Second snow is winter (and it stays)."**

---

### Winter (November-May) - SURVIVAL MODE

**Challenges:**
- **EXTREME COLD:** -20°F to -40°F (valleys), -50°F+ (high peaks)
- **Deep snow:** 4-10 feet accumulated (15+ feet in drifts)
- **Short days:** 8-9 hours daylight (Dec-Jan)
- **Total isolation:** No travel (passes closed, avalanche danger)
- **Altitude + cold:** Double jeopardy (thin air + extreme cold)
- **Avalanches:** Constant danger (see hazards)
- **Cabin fever:** Isolation, darkness, extreme

**Priorities:**
1. **FIRE MAINTENANCE:** 24/7 (losing fire at -40°F = rapid death)
2. **Firewood:** Burn 1/2 to 1 cord per month (keep 2+ weeks indoors)
3. **Water:** Melt snow (10:1 ratio, fuel-intensive)
4. **Food rationing:** Make stored food last 6 months (Nov-May)
5. **Avalanche awareness:** If cabin in terrain, know escape route
6. **Mental health:** Isolation, boredom (depression, anxiety risk)
7. **Stay PUT:** Do NOT travel in winter (whiteout, avalanche = death)

**Daily Routine:**
```
Dawn (7-8 AM): Stoke fire, melt snow for water, eat
Morning: Fire maintenance, equipment repair, check firewood supply
Midday: Meal, rest (conserve calories)
Afternoon: Indoor work, fire maintenance
Evening (4-5 PM): Already dark, banking fire, meal, long night
```

**Survival Rules:**
- Stay dry (wet = hypothermia = death)
- Keep fire going (NEVER let fire die completely)
- Ration food (spring is 4-6 months away)
- Don't overexert (altitude + cold = exhaustion, sweating = hypothermia)
- **NEVER leave shelter in blizzard** (disorientation, freezing, death)
- Monitor for avalanche sounds (roar, crack, thump)

**Expected:** Lose 10-20 lbs over winter (calorie deficit common)

---

### Spring (May-June) - SLOW AWAKENING

**Advantages:**
- Days lengthening (9 → 14+ hours)
- Temperatures rising (20-30°F → 50-60°F)
- **End of isolation:** Passes may open (June)
- Avalanche danger decreasing (stabilizing snowpack)
- First plants (dandelion, glacier lily)

**Challenges:**
- **Still deep snow:** 3-6 feet at elevation (melts slowly)
- **Avalanche danger continues:** Warming temps destabilize snowpack
- **Mud season:** Trails impassable (snowmelt + thawing ground)
- **Food stores depleted:** 6 months of winter = supplies low
- **Physical condition:** Weak from winter (months of limited activity, calorie deficit)

**Priorities:**
- Repair shelter from winter (snow damage, roof issues)
- Restock firewood (while still cold, before bugs)
- First foraging (dandelion, wild onion)
- Fishing (trout active in snowmelt streams)
- **Wait for stable weather:** Don't rush into backcountry (avalanche, hypothermia risk)

**Rule: "Spring in the mountains is just 'late winter with hope.'"**

## Regional Hazards Summary

**Primary Killers:**
1. **Altitude sickness:** High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE), High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) - Fatal
2. **Hypothermia/cold exposure:** -40°F+ wind chill, year-round risk above treeline
3. **Avalanches:** 25-30 deaths per year in US (most in Rockies)
4. **Lightning:** Afternoon thunderstorms, above treeline = target
5. **Grizzly bears:** Northern Rockies, aggressive, attacks common
6. **Mountain lions:** Ambush predators, rare attacks but present
7. **Falls:** Cliffs, steep terrain, rockfall

**See l2-regional-rockies-hazards.md for detailed hazard protocols.**
