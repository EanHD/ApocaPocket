summary: Month-by-month guide to spring foraging in temperate North America (USDA zones 4-7). Spring is the most abundant foraging season — young greens are tender, nutritious, and easy to identify. Adjust
  timing by 2-3 weeks per zone.
warnings:
- Spring is also when the most toxic plants emerge — poison hemlock, water hemlock, and death camas are all spring plants
- Many edible spring greens have toxic look-alikes when young. Wait for positive identifying features to develop if unsure.
- Harvest sustainably — take no more than 10% of any wild plant population
- Foraging in national parks is generally prohibited — know local regulations
steps:
- 'MARCH (early spring, snow melting): Chickweed (Stellaria media) — one of the first greens. Grows in mats in disturbed soil. Eat raw in salads. Dandelion rosettes emerge — harvest before flowering for
  mildest flavor. Chives/wild onions — green shoots appear in fields. Garlic mustard basal rosettes — pull entire plant (it''s invasive).'
- 'APRIL (mid-spring, soil warming): Stinging nettles — harvest top 4-6 inches with gloves. Most nutritious wild green. Cook or dry. Ramps (wild leeks) — distinctive garlic-onion smell, broad leaves, eastern
  forests. Harvest sparingly (slow to reproduce). Violet leaves and flowers — mild, high in vitamin C. Eat raw. Cleavers (Galium) — use tips raw or cooked. Traditional spring tonic.'
- 'APRIL-MAY: Wild asparagus — looks exactly like garden asparagus, found near old homesteads and field edges. Fiddlehead ferns (ostrich fern ONLY — other ferns may be carcinogenic) — harvest tightly coiled
  fronds, must be cooked (boil 10 min or steam 15). Japanese knotweed young shoots — peel, cook like rhubarb. Invasive — harvest aggressively.'
- 'MAY (late spring): Lamb''s quarters (Chenopodium album) begins — one of the most nutritious wild greens. Amaranth shoots emerge. Wild strawberry flowers appear (fruit in June). Elderflowers for tea and
  fritters. Basswood/linden leaves — young leaves are mild and edible raw.'
- 'SPRING ROOTS: Burdock root (best in first year plants, before flowering stalk). Dandelion root (roast for coffee). Chicory root (roast for coffee). Jerusalem artichoke (dig early spring before growth
  starts).'
- 'SPRING BARK AND SAP: Birch sap (tap in March when sap flows — drill small hole, insert tube). Maple sap (same method — 40:1 sap to syrup ratio). Pine inner bark (cambium) — scrape and eat raw or dry
  and grind to flour. White pine, red pine, and spruce all work.'
- 'SPRING MUSHROOMS: Morels (Morchella spp.) — April through May, near dead elms, tulip poplars, ash trees, and in old orchards. The prize of spring foraging. Dryad''s saddle (Cerioporus squamosus) — large
  shelf mushroom on dead hardwoods. Best when young and tender.'
- 'IDENTIFICATION PRACTICE: spring is the best time to learn plants — they change rapidly week to week. Visit the same areas weekly and photograph changes. Press specimens. This builds the visual library
  essential for confident foraging.'
