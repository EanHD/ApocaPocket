summary: 'Pemmican is a traditional concentrated survival food: dried meat powder + rendered fat + optional dried berries. Calorie density of ~135 cal/oz (3000+ cal/lb). Shelf life: months to years at room
  temperature. The ultimate portable field ration.'
warnings:
- Fat must be FULLY rendered (all water and meat particles removed) or pemmican will go rancid within days
- Use only LEAN meat for the jerky component — fat in the meat will go rancid (use separate rendered fat)
- Rancid pemmican smells sour/paint-like and should NOT be eaten — rancid fats are toxic
- Botulism risk if moisture content is too high — meat must be completely dry (snaps, doesn't bend)
steps:
- 'DRY THE MEAT: slice lean meat (deer, elk, beef, rabbit, fish) into strips 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick, cutting WITH the grain. Dry over low smoky fire (not direct heat) for 12-24 hours, or in hot sun for 2-3
  days. Meat is done when it SNAPS when bent — any flexibility means moisture remains.'
- 'POWDER THE JERKY: once bone-dry, pound jerky into powder/fine shreds using rocks or a heavy stick on a flat stone. The finer the better — this determines the texture of the pemmican. Should be fluffy
  and fibrous.'
- 'RENDER THE FAT: chop raw animal fat (suet/kidney fat is best — hard white fat, not soft belly fat) into small pieces. Heat slowly in a pot over LOW heat. Do not let it smoke or burn. Fat will melt and
  water will steam off. Continue until all crackling (crispy bits) float and liquid is clear golden. Strain through cloth. This is tallow.'
- 'MIX: combine meat powder and warm (not hot) liquid tallow at approximately 1:1 ratio by weight. Mix thoroughly. The fat should completely coat all meat fibers. It should hold together when squeezed but
  not be dripping wet.'
- 'OPTIONAL ADDITIONS: dried berries (blueberries, cranberries, serviceberries, chokecherries) — add up to 1/3 volume. Dried berries add vitamin C and flavor. Crush berries into powder first. Wild honey
  (1-2 tablespoons per pound) adds calories and flavor.'
- 'FORM AND STORE: press mixture firmly into bars, balls, or pack into intestine casings or waxed cloth wraps. Remove all air pockets. Let cool completely. Each bar should be dense and hard at room temperature.'
- 'NUTRITIONAL PROFILE (per pound): approximately 3000-3500 calories, 40-50g protein, 250-300g fat. This is the densest portable food possible — 1 lb of pemmican replaces 3-4 lbs of normal food.'
- 'SHELF LIFE: properly made pemmican (fully dried meat, fully rendered fat, no moisture) lasts 1-5 years at cool room temperature. Cooler = longer. Traditional pemmican has been found edible after decades.
  Signs of spoilage: sour smell, mold, soft/slimy texture.'
- 'EATING: pemmican can be eaten raw (it''s already cooked/dried), crumbled into boiling water to make a stew (called ''rubaboo''), or sliced and fried. Start with small portions — it''s very rich and can
  cause GI upset if you eat too much initially.'
- 'YIELD: 5 lbs fresh lean meat → ~1 lb jerky. 1 lb jerky + 1 lb rendered fat = ~2 lbs pemmican. One deer (60 lbs lean meat) = ~24 lbs pemmican = 40+ days of full caloric needs for one person.'
