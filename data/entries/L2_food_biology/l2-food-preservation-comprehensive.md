summary: Without refrigeration, food spoils rapidly. Preservation methods remove water or alter chemistry to prevent bacterial growth. Drying, smoking, salting, fermenting, and cold storage (root cellar)
  allow long-term food storage.
warnings:
- Improperly preserved food causes botulism, salmonella, mold poisoning - follow guidelines strictly
- Canning requires pressure canner for low-acid foods - improper canning is deadly
- Smoked meat still requires cool dry storage - smoking alone does not prevent all spoilage
steps:
- 'DRYING (removes water, bacteria cannot grow): SUN DRY - thin slices on racks, 3-5 days hot sun, cover at night. SMOKE DRY - hang in smokehouse, cool smoke for days. OVEN DRY - low temp (60C) for hours.
  Fully dried = hard, no moisture when squeezed. Store in airtight container. Rehydrate before eating.'
- 'SMOKING (drying + flavor + some preservation): Cold smoke (20-30C, days) for flavor + drying. Hot smoke (60-80C, hours) cooks and dries. Smoke from hardwoods (no pine - creosote). Hang meat/fish in smokehouse
  or improvised smoking chamber.'
- 'SALTING (salt draws out water, creates hostile environment): Pack meat/fish in salt (complete coverage). Leave 1-2 weeks. Rinse excess salt. Hang to dry. Result: very salty, lasts months. Soak in water
  before cooking (removes excess salt).'
- 'FERMENTING (beneficial bacteria/yeast prevent spoilage): Sauerkraut (cabbage + salt), kimchi, pickles (vegetables in brine), beer, wine. Lactic acid bacteria preserve food. See fermentation entry.'
- 'ROOT CELLAR (cold storage, 0-10C): Dig underground room or use natural cave. Cool temps slow spoilage. Store root vegetables (potatoes, carrots, beets), apples, cured meat, cheese. Humidity 80-90 percent.'
- 'ROTATION: Eat oldest food first. Check stored food monthly for mold, spoilage.'

# Food Preservation Methods — Drying, Smoking, Salting, Fermenting

Without refrigeration, food spoils rapidly. Preservation methods remove water or alter chemistry to prevent bacterial growth. Drying, smoking, salting, fermenting, and cold storage (root cellar) allow long-term food storage.
