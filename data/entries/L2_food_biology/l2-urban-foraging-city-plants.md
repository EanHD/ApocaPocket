# Urban Foraging - City Plants and Trees

## Overview

**Cities contain surprising amounts of edible plants - parks, medians, abandoned lots, street trees, and even sidewalk cracks.** Urban foraging provides free, fresh food when grocery stores fail or become inaccessible.

**Advantages:**
- Widely available (every city has parks, street trees)
- No wilderness travel required (safer in civil unrest)
- Often overlooked (low competition vs wilderness areas)
- Year-round options (many cities plant ornamental fruit trees)

**Cautions:**
- Pollution (exhaust fumes, pesticides, dog urine)
- Legal issues (public vs private property)
- Misidentification (some ornamental plants toxic)

**Harvest window:** Spring (tender greens) → Summer (fruits) → Fall (nuts, seeds) → Winter (roots, tree bark)

---

## Safety Rules (CRITICAL)

### Pollution Zones (Avoid or Use Caution)

**HIGH RISK (avoid):**
- Within 25 feet of busy roads (lead, exhaust particulates)
- Industrial areas (chemical contamination)
- Railroad tracks (creosote, herbicides)
- Treated lawns (pesticides, herbicides - visible spray markers)

**MODERATE RISK (wash thoroughly):**
- 25-100 feet from roads (reduced but present contamination)
- Dog walking areas (fecal bacteria, urine - wash well)
- Public parks (may be sprayed - ask grounds crew)

**LOWER RISK:**
- Residential yards (with permission)
- Community gardens
- Untreated city parks
- Greenways and trails (away from roads)

### Washing Protocol

**All urban foraged plants:**
1. Rinse in cold water (remove visible dirt, debris)
2. Soak in vinegar solution (1 part vinegar : 3 parts water) for 5 minutes
3. Rinse again in clean water
4. Pat dry with clean towel

**If high pollution suspected:**
- Discard outer leaves (concentrate pollutants)
- Cook instead of eating raw (reduces some contaminants)
- Limit consumption (don't rely 100% on urban foraging)

## Common Urban Edible Plants

### Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale)

**Identification:**
- Yellow flower (many petals, 1-2" diameter)
- Toothed leaves (rosette pattern, "lion's tooth")
- White sap in stem (milky latex)
- Hollow stem
- No branching (single flower per stem)

**Edible Parts:**
- **Leaves:** Young leaves best (tender, less bitter) - salads, cooked greens
- **Flowers:** Yellow petals (remove green base - bitter) - salads, wine, jelly
- **Roots:** Roasted (coffee substitute), raw (very bitter)
- **All parts edible all year** (leaves more tender in spring)

**Nutrition:** High in vitamins A, C, K, iron, calcium

**Harvest:** Entire plant (pull up root if you want it, or cut leaves and leave root to regrow)

**Lookalikes:** 
- Cat's ear (multiple flowers per stem, forked stem) - also edible
- Flatweed (no milky sap) - also edible
- **No toxic lookalikes** (dandelions are very safe)

---

### Plantain (Plantago major / lanceolata)

**Identification:**
- Broad leaves (oval, parallel veins)
- Low to ground (rosette)
- Flower spike (thin, tall, green with tiny brown flowers)
- Stringy when leaf torn (fibrous)

**Edible Parts:**
- **Young leaves:** Tender (spring), tougher (summer) - salads, cooked greens
- **Seeds:** Tiny (collect from flower spike when dry) - nutritious, psyllium fiber

**Nutrition:** Vitamins A, C, K, calcium, iron

**Medicinal:** Poultice for insect bites, minor wounds (anti-inflammatory)

**Harvest:** Pick leaves before flower stalk forms (most tender)

**Lookalikes:**
- Lily of the Valley leaves (toxic) - but has strong sweet smell, grows in clusters, plantain has no smell
- **SMELL TEST:** Plantain = no smell, Lily of the Valley = sweet perfume smell

---

### Purslane (Portulaca oleracea)

**Identification:**
- Succulent (fleshy, thick leaves)
- Reddish stem
- Small yellow flowers (5 petals)
- Grows flat along ground
- Smooth leaves (no hairs)

**Edible Parts:**
- **Leaves and stems:** Entire above-ground plant - raw (salads, tart/lemony taste), cooked (sautéed, pickled)

**Nutrition:** 
- **Omega-3 fatty acids** (rare in plants)
- Vitamins A, C, E, magnesium

**Harvest:** Pinch off tips (plant regrows), or pull entire plant

**Lookalikes:**
- Spurge (toxic) - has milky sap (purslane has clear sap)
- **SAP TEST:** Break stem - clear sap = purslane, milky sap = spurge (AVOID)

---

### Clover (Trifolium species - Red, White)

**Identification:**
- Three leaflets (classic "shamrock" shape)
- Round flower heads (white, pink, or red)
- Low growing (lawn weed)

**Edible Parts:**
- **Flowers:** Sweet taste - raw (salads), dried (tea)
- **Leaves:** Young only (tender) - raw in small amounts, cooked better (contains tannins)
- **Seeds:** Tiny (collect from dried flower heads) - nutritious but tedious

**Nutrition:** Protein, calcium, vitamins B, C

**Caution:** Large amounts raw can cause digestive upset (bloating) - cook to reduce tannins

**Harvest:** Flower heads (pull gently from stem), young leaves

**Lookalikes:**
- Wood sorrel (also edible, heart-shaped leaflets, sour taste)
- **No toxic lookalikes in urban areas**

---

### Chickweed (Stellaria media)

**Identification:**
- Small white flowers (5 petals, deeply split - looks like 10 petals)
- Tiny leaves (oval, opposite pairs)
- Single line of hairs on stem (rotates around stem)
- Sprawling ground cover

**Edible Parts:**
- **Entire above-ground plant:** Tender, mild flavor - raw (salads), cooked (greens)

**Nutrition:** Vitamins A, C, iron, calcium

**Harvest:** Pinch off tender tips (4-6 inches), leave roots

**Lookalikes:**
- Mouse-ear chickweed (also edible, hairy leaves)
- Scarlet pimpernel (toxic) - but has red/orange flowers (chickweed = white)

---

### Lamb's Quarters (Chenopodium album)

**Identification:**
- Diamond-shaped leaves (toothed edges)
- White powdery coating on young leaves (looks frosted)
- Grows 1-3 feet tall
- Green flower clusters (not showy)

**Edible Parts:**
- **Young leaves and shoots:** Before flowering - raw (small amounts), cooked (spinach substitute)
- **Seeds:** Tiny black seeds (collect when mature) - quinoa relative, nutritious

**Nutrition:** 
- **Higher protein than spinach**
- Vitamins A, C, calcium, iron

**Caution:** Contains oxalic acid (like spinach) - don't eat in huge quantities raw (cook to reduce)

**Harvest:** Top 6-8 inches of young plants (most tender)

**Lookalikes:**
- Pigweed (Amaranth) - also edible
- **No common toxic lookalikes**

---

## Urban Fruit Trees (Often Overlooked)

### Apple Trees (Malus species)

**Locations:**
- Old residential areas (backyard trees overgrown)
- Parks (ornamental crabapples)
- Abandoned lots (former homesteads)

**Harvest:**
- **Fall (Aug-Oct):** Apples ripen (varies by variety)
- Test: Gently twist - if comes off easily, ripe
- **Crabapples:** Small (1-2"), often tart - still edible (jelly, cider)

**Safety:** Avoid apples with visible rot, insect damage (worms inside - cut around them)

---

### Pear Trees (Pyrus species)

**Locations:**
- Similar to apples (old residential, parks)
- Often unpruned and overgrown

**Harvest:**
- **Fall (Aug-Sep):** Pears ripen (pick slightly underripe, ripen off tree)
- Test: Gently lift - if stem separates, ready

**Identification:** Bell-shaped fruit, white flowers in spring

---

### Mulberry Trees (Morus species)

**Locations:**
- Street trees (common urban planting)
- Parks, parking lots
- Sidewalk trees (messy berries, often removed now but older neighborhoods have them)

**Harvest:**
- **Early Summer (Jun-Jul):** Berries ripen red then dark purple/black
- Spread tarp or sheet under tree, shake branches (berries fall)
- Eat fresh, or make jam, wine

**Nutrition:** High in vitamin C, iron, fiber

**Caution:** Stains clothing (wear dark colors), very short shelf life (eat within 24 hours or freeze)

---

### Oak Trees (Quercus species - for acorns)

**Locations:**
- Parks, residential areas, street trees

**Harvest:**
- **Fall (Sep-Nov):** Acorns mature (brown, fall from tree)
- Collect from ground (easier than climbing)
- Look for plump acorns with caps attached

**Processing (REQUIRED - raw acorns toxic):**
1. Shell acorns (remove hard outer shell)
2. **Leach tannins:** Boil in water 2-3 times (change water when brown), OR cold leach (soak in stream/running water 1-3 days)
3. Taste: Should be mild, nutty (if bitter, leach more)
4. Dry (oven 200°F or air dry)
5. Grind into flour (food processor, mortar & pestle)

**Uses:** Acorn flour (mix 1:1 with wheat flour for bread, pancakes), acorn meal (porridge)

**Time investment:** High (shelling + leaching = hours), but calorie-rich payoff

---

## Foraging Strategy (Maximizing Safety & Yield)

### Best Locations (Priority Order)

1. **Residential yards (with permission)** - lowest pollution, known pesticide status
2. **Community gardens (ask)** - managed, often organic
3. **Parks (away from roads, athletic fields)** - moderate pollution, may be sprayed
4. **Greenways / trails** - lower traffic, nature corridors
5. **Sidewalk cracks / medians** - high pollution (wash thoroughly)

### Legal Considerations

**Generally OK:**
- Public parks (unless signs prohibit)
- Sidewalk strips (between sidewalk and street)
- Abandoned lots (technically trespassing, but rarely enforced if not destructive)

**Ask First:**
- Private yards (knock on door, offer to share harvest)
- Community gardens (join or ask permission)
- Business properties (ask management)

**Prohibited:**
- National parks (federal crime to forage)
- Protected nature preserves
- Private property with "No Trespassing" signs

**Courtesy:** Take only what you'll use, leave some for wildlife and other foragers

## Common Mistakes ❌ → ✓ Correct Approach

| ❌ Mistake | ✓ Correct |
|-----------|----------|
| Foraging right next to busy roads | Stay 25+ feet away (pollution) |
| Not washing urban plants | Always wash + vinegar soak (5 min) |
| Eating large amounts of unknown plants | Start small (test for allergies, digestive upset) |
| Ignoring dog walking areas | Avoid or wash very thoroughly (fecal bacteria) |
| Harvesting from treated lawns | Look for spray markers, ask property owner |
| Taking entire plant populations | Take 20% max, leave rest to regrow |
| Eating raw acorns | MUST leach tannins (toxic otherwise) |
| Foraging in national parks | Illegal federally (stick to city parks) |

---

## Poisonous Plant Avoidance (Urban)

### Red Flags (DO NOT EAT)

**Milky sap (unless dandelion):**
- Spurge, dogbane, various toxic plants
- Exception: Dandelion, lettuce (both safe)

**Umbrella-shaped flower clusters (Apiaceae family):**
- Poison hemlock (DEADLY), water hemlock (DEADLY)
- Exception: Wild carrot (Queen Anne's Lace) - but avoid entire family unless expert

**Shiny leaves + white berries:**
- Pokeweed (roots/berries toxic, young leaves require special cooking)
- Bittersweet nightshade, white baneberry

**Strong unpleasant smell:**
- Jimsonweed (thorn apple), nightshades
- Exception: Wild garlic/onion (safe, edible)

---

## Preparation Methods

### Raw (Salads)
- **Best for:** Dandelion (young leaves), chickweed, purslane, plantain (young), clover flowers
- **Wash thoroughly** (vinegar soak)
- Mix with other greens (strong flavors blend better)

### Cooked (Sautéed, Boiled)
- **Best for:** Tougher greens (older dandelion, plantain, lamb's quarters)
- **Method:** Sauté with oil/butter + garlic, OR boil 5-10 min (discard water if bitter)
- Reduces bitterness, makes more digestible

### Dried (Tea, Seasoning)
- **Best for:** Dandelion root (roasted "coffee"), clover flowers, plantain leaves
- **Method:** Air dry 1-2 weeks (or dehydrator), store in sealed container
