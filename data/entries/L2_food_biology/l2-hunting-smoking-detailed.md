summary: 'Smoking preserves meat and fish through dehydration, antimicrobial smoke compounds, and surface protein coagulation. Two methods: hot smoking (cooks AND preserves, 1-6 hours) and cold smoking
  (preserves only, 1-7 days). Proper smoking can preserve food for weeks to months without refrigeration.'
warnings:
- NEVER use resinous wood (pine, spruce, fir, cedar) for smoking food — resin deposits toxic creosote and produces bitter, potentially carcinogenic flavors
- Cold smoking is DANGEROUS without prior salt-curing — temperatures in the danger zone (40-140°F) allow bacterial growth. Salt-cure first.
- Improperly smoked meat can harbor botulism (anaerobic bacteria) — ensure thorough drying and smoking
- Smoke in well-ventilated area — carbon monoxide from smoldering fires is lethal in enclosed spaces
steps:
- 'WOOD SELECTION: hardwoods only. BEST: hickory (strong, classic), oak (medium, versatile), apple/cherry (mild, sweet — best for fish), maple (mild, slightly sweet), alder (delicate — traditional for salmon).
  AVOID ALL conifers (pine, spruce, fir, cedar, cypress) — toxic resin.'
- 'HOT SMOKING (cook + preserve): Temperature 150-275°F (65-135°C) at meat level. Build a fire, let it burn down to coals, then add green/soaked hardwood chunks for smoke. Meat is placed 2-4 feet above
  the smoke source. Time: 2-6 hours depending on thickness. Meat is safe to eat immediately.'
- 'HOT SMOKE — FIELD SMOKER: dig a pit 12 inches deep, build fire inside. Place a grill of green wood sticks across the pit, 2 feet above the coals. Lay meat strips on the grill. Cover loosely with bark
  or green leaves to trap smoke (but allow airflow). Maintain steady thin smoke — flames = too hot.'
- 'COLD SMOKING (preserve only): Temperature 68-86°F (20-30°C) — NOT hot enough to cook. Requires a separate fire pit connected by a 6-10 foot tunnel/pipe to the smoking chamber. The tunnel cools the smoke.
  Smoke continuously for 1-7 days. Fish: 24-48 hours. Meat: 3-7 days.'
- 'COLD SMOKE PREREQUISITE — SALT CURE: before cold smoking, meat MUST be salt-cured. Rub meat generously with salt (1 lb salt per 10 lbs meat). Pack in salt for 7-14 days in cool conditions. Rinse off
  excess salt before smoking. Without salt-curing, cold smoking is unsafe.'
- 'MEAT PREPARATION: cut into strips 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, cutting WITH the grain for jerky-style. For whole fish: gut, remove head, butterfly (split along backbone), score flesh every 2 inches. Brine
  fish for 1 hour (1/3 cup salt per quart water) before smoking.'
- 'FIRE MANAGEMENT: the #1 mistake is too much flame and not enough smoke. Use smoldering wood, not burning wood. Soak wood chunks in water for 1 hour before adding to coals. Add a few chunks every 30-60
  minutes. Smoke should be thin and blue, not thick and white (white smoke = too wet/cool, deposits creosote).'
- 'DONENESS — HOT SMOKE: meat is done when internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C) for meat, 145°F (63°C) for fish. Without a thermometer: fish flakes easily with a stick, meat tears apart at the grain
  (not bends). Surface should be dark golden to mahogany colored.'
- 'DONENESS — COLD SMOKE: meat/fish surface is dry and firm with a shiny dark pellicle (protein skin). Interior should be dry but still slightly pliable. Weight loss of 30-40% from fresh weight indicates
  adequate drying.'
- 'STORAGE: hot-smoked meat/fish keeps 1-2 weeks at room temperature, 1-2 months in cool conditions. Cold-smoked and salt-cured products keep 2-6 months in cool, dry, ventilated storage. Wrap in cloth (not
  plastic — needs airflow). Hang in a cool, dry, breezy location. Discard if slimy, foul-smelling, or moldy.'

# Smoking Meat and Fish — Hot Smoke vs Cold Smoke

Smoking preserves meat and fish through dehydration, antimicrobial smoke compounds, and surface protein coagulation. Two methods: hot smoking (cooks AND preserves, 1-6 hours) and cold smoking (preserves only, 1-7 days). Proper smoking can preserve food for weeks to months without refrigeration.
