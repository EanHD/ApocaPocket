## 1. EXTREME COLD - The Constant Threat

### Cold Injury Statistics (Alaska)
- **Hypothermia deaths:** 10-20 per year
- **Frostbite hospitalizations:** 50-100 per year
- **Equipment-assisted (drunk, stranded):** 70% of cold deaths

---

### Temperature Realities

**Interior Alaska (Fairbanks, Denali):**
- Average January low: -20°F to -25°F
- Cold snaps: -40°F to -60°F (common, 5-15 days per winter)
- Record: -80°F (Prospect Creek, 1971)
- **100+ days below 0°F** per winter (November-March)

**Arctic (North Slope, Barrow/Utqiaġvik):**
- Average winter: -10°F to -30°F
- Cold snaps: -50°F to -60°F
- Wind chill: -70°F to -100°F
- **Dark (polar night):** 65+ days (mid-November to mid-January)

**Coastal (Southeast Alaska):**
- Milder: 20°F to 40°F winter (but WET = different danger)
- Hypothermia risk remains (wet cold = deadly)

---

### Wind Chill (Alaska-Specific)

| Actual Temp | 10 mph wind | 20 mph wind | 30 mph wind | 40 mph wind |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0°F | -9°F | -15°F | -19°F | -22°F |
| -20°F | -35°F | -44°F | -49°F | -53°F |
| -40°F | -61°F | -73°F | -80°F | -84°F |
| -60°F | -87°F | -102°F | -110°F | -115°F |

**Frostbite Time:**
- **Wind chill -40°F to -60°F:** Frostbite in 5-10 minutes
- **Wind chill -60°F to -80°F:** Frostbite in 2-5 minutes
- **Wind chill -80°F+:** Frostbite in <2 minutes (almost instant)

---

### Equipment Failure Temperature (-40°F = Critical Threshold)

**At -40°F, Equipment STOPS WORKING:**

**Batteries (ALL types):**
- Lithium: 20-30% capacity
- Alkaline: 0-10% capacity (essentially dead)
- Lead-acid (vehicles): Cranking amps reduced 75%
- **Solution:** Keep batteries warm (in clothing, sleeping bag)

**Fuel:**
- Gasoline: Gels, won't flow
- Diesel: Gels at -10°F to -20°F (requires winter blend)
- Propane: Pressure drops (won't vaporize below -40°F)
- Kerosene: Thickens
- **Solution:** Anti-gel additives, heated fuel tanks, winter blends

**Mechanical:**
- Metal becomes brittle (shatters, snaps)
- Rubber seals crack
- Hydraulics freeze
- Tires lose pressure (1 psi per 10°F drop)
- Bearings seize
- **Tools:** Axe handles snap, chainsaws won't start

**Electronics:**
- LCD screens freeze (unreadable)
- Touchscreens don't work
- Plastic housings shatter
- GPS: Works, but battery dies in minutes
- Radios: Work, but battery issue

**Human:**
- Exposed skin: Frostbite in minutes
- Lungs: Breathing -40°F air = pain, ice crystals in airways
- Eyes: Cornea can freeze (snow blindness + cold = corneal damage)
- Fingers/toes: Numbness in seconds (lose dexterity)

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** At -40°F, you are in an ALIEN environment. Normal equipment is unreliable. Survival depends on fire, shelter, and clothing.

---

### Hypothermia (Alaska Progression)

#### Mild (95-90°F core temp)
- Intense shivering
- Slurred speech
- Fumbling hands (can't zip jacket, tie knots)
- **Action:** Get to warm shelter, dry clothes, hot drinks, light activity

#### Moderate (90-82°F)
- Shivering STOPS (bad sign)
- Confusion, disorientation ("I'm fine, leave me alone")
- Stumbling, falling
- Paradoxical undressing (feels hot, removes clothes)
- **Action:** EMERGENCY - shelter, aggressive rewarming, body-to-body heat, heated fluids

#### Severe (<82°F)
- Unconscious
- Weak/absent pulse (check for 60 seconds - heart rate very slow)
- Rigid muscles
- Appears dead
- **Action:** CPR (if no pulse), GENTLE handling (rough movement = cardiac arrest), aggressive rewarming

**"Not dead until warm and dead"** (Alaskan saying - people have survived core temps of 56°F)

---

### Frostbite (Alaska Reality)

**Superficial (1st-2nd degree):**
- White/gray skin, waxy appearance
- Firm surface, but tissue underneath soft
- Blisters (clear fluid) form in 24 hours
- **Rewarming:** Painful (good sign - nerves work)
- **Recovery:** 2-4 weeks, usually full recovery

**Deep (3rd-4th degree):**
- Gray/blue/black skin
- Rock-hard tissue (ice crystals in cells)
- No sensation (nerves frozen)
- Blisters (blood-filled) or no blisters
- **Gangrene risk:** Tissue death, amputation possible
- **Recovery:** Months, often permanent damage or amputation

**Common Sites:**
- Fingers, toes (extremities = first to freeze)
- Nose, ears, cheeks (facial exposure)
- Penis (men urinating outside in -40°F - yes, this happens)

**Rewarming (Critical Protocol):**
1. **Don't rewarm if refreezing possible** (worse damage, "freeze-thaw-freeze" = catastrophic)
2. **Warm water immersion:** 98-105°F (feels HOT to frozen tissue), 20-30 min
3. **Extreme pain:** Is normal (nerves waking up), give pain meds if available
4. **Don't rub tissue** (causes more damage)
5. **Don't use direct heat** (fire, stove - causes burns)
6. **Elevate:** Reduce swelling
7. **Protect blisters:** Don't pop (infection risk)
8. **Don't walk on frozen feet** (if possible - more damage)

**Rule:** "Frozen in, thawed out" - If far from help, keep frozen and walk out. Thaw once, safely. Refreezing = amputation.

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Wind chill frostbite timeline chart, equipment failure temperature thresholds, frostbite progression photos/illustrations.

## 2. BROWN BEARS (Grizzlies) - Apex Predator

### Alaska Brown Bear Profile

**Size (Largest in World):**
- **Kodiak Island brown bears:** 800-1500 lbs (males), 400-700 lbs (females)
- **Coastal brown bears:** 600-1200 lbs (salmon-fed, huge)
- **Interior grizzlies:** 400-800 lbs (leaner, less food)

**Population:** 30,000-35,000 in Alaska (healthy, thriving)

**Range:** ALL OF ALASKA (except some islands)

---

### Alaska Bear Attack Statistics
- **30-40 documented attacks per year** (highest in North America)
- **1-3 fatalities per year** (average)
- **Most attacks:** Surprise encounters, sows with cubs, food defense
- **Least attacks:** Groups of 4+ people (no recorded attacks on groups 4+)

**Why Alaska has more attacks:**
- More bears (denser population)
- More remote areas (humans in bear country)
- Salmon streams (high bear density, feeding behavior)
- Coastal bears (larger, more aggressive)

---

### When Alaska Bears are MOST Dangerous

**1. Salmon Streams (July-September):**
- Bears concentrated (10-20 bears per mile of stream)
- Feeding frenzy (aggressive, food-focused)
- Surprise encounters common (brush, noise of water masks approach)
- **EXTREME CAUTION:** Required near ANY salmon stream

**2. Sows with Cubs (May-July):**
- Mother bear EXTREMELY protective
- Will charge with ZERO warning
- Cubs can be 50-100 yards away (not always visible)
- **Give 300+ feet space** (use binoculars)

**3. Fall Fattening (September-October):**
- Pre-hibernation (desperate for calories)
- Will defend food sources aggressively
- Less cautious (need calories > avoiding humans)

**4. Carcass Defense:**
- Bear on elk/moose/caribou kill
- Will defend to death (food = survival)
- **Signs:** Ravens circling, smell of decay, torn-up vegetation
- **If you see carcass:** LEAVE IMMEDIATELY (bear nearby)

**5. Habituated/Food-Conditioned Bears:**
- Lost fear of humans (campground bears, garbage-fed)
- Unpredictable, dangerous
- **Most likely to cause predatory attacks**

---

### Alaska Bear Encounter Protocol

#### Prevention (MANDATORY)

**Make Noise (CONSTANT):**
- "Hey bear!" every 30-60 seconds (Alaskan standard)
- Louder near: Streams (water noise), salmon runs, berry patches, dense brush
- Bear bells: NOT ENOUGH (too quiet), MUST yell/talk

**Group Hiking:**
- 4+ people = safest (no recorded attacks on groups of 4+)
- Stay together (don't spread out)
- Keep children close (between adults)

**Bear Spray (MANDATORY):**
- 10+ oz canister (Counter Assault, UDAP, Guard Alaska brands)
- Hip holster (NOT in pack - need 2-second access)
- Safety off when in bear country
- **Practice drawing** (muscle memory critical)
- **Range:** 20-30 feet (wait until bear is CLOSE)

**Food Storage (CRITICAL):**
- **Bear-resistant food canisters:** Hard-sided, approved (MANDATORY in many areas)
- **Never in tent:** Food, toiletries, scented items, ANYTHING with smell
- Cook 100+ yards from camp
- Sleep 100+ yards from cooking area
- **Coastal:** Hang fish on beach AWAY from camp

---

#### Encounter Response (Distance-Dependent)

**If You See Bear (Distance >100 ft):**
1. **STOP, don't run**
2. **Identify yourself:** "Hey bear, it's a human" (calm, firm voice)
3. **Wave arms slowly** (appear large, human-like, not prey)
4. **Back away slowly** (sideways, maintain eye contact)
5. **Give space:** Detour 300+ feet wide
6. **Don't approach:** Even for photos (people die doing this)

**If Bear Aware of You (Distance 30-100 ft):**
- **Stand your ground**
- Talk calmly, continuously
- Prepare bear spray (safety off, finger on trigger)
- **Don't run** (triggers chase instinct - bears can run 35 mph)
- Watch bear's body language:
  - Ears forward, head up = curious (may approach)
  - Ears back, head low = agitated (may charge)
  - Huffing, jaw popping, ground slapping = VERY agitated

**If Bear Charges (Bluff or Real):**

**90% of charges are BLUFF CHARGES:**
- Bear charges at high speed
- Stops or veers off at 10-30 feet
- May slap ground, huff, pop jaw
- **DO NOT RUN** (triggers real attack)
- **Stand your ground** (hardest thing to do)
- **Prepare spray:** Finger on trigger
- **If bear within 20-30 feet:** SPRAY (aim at face, 2-second burst, create cloud)
- **If bear veers away:** It was a bluff

**10% are REAL ATTACKS:**
- Bear charges through spray (rare)
- OR silent, head-down charge (predatory)

---

#### If Bear Makes Contact (Attack)

**PLAY DEAD (For Defensive Attack - Most Common):**
1. Lie flat on stomach OR curl in ball
2. Hands behind neck (protect head/neck)
3. Legs spread (harder to flip)
4. **Stay still and silent** (even if bear bites, claws - CRITICAL)
5. Bear usually leaves once threat neutralized (you're "dead")
6. **WAIT 10+ minutes after bear leaves** (may be watching, return if you move)

**Defensive Attack Signs:**
- Surprise encounter (you startled bear)
- Sow with cubs (protecting offspring)
- Bear on carcass (protecting food)
- **Bear attacks, then stops and watches** (assessing threat)

**FIGHT BACK (For Predatory Attack - Rare but Happens):**
- Bear stalking behavior before attack
- Continues attacking for >2 minutes (biting, mauling, not stopping)
- Bear trying to eat you (doesn't stop when you play dead)

**Fight Back Tactics:**
- Use EVERYTHING: Rocks, sticks, fists, knife, boot, trekking pole
- Target: Eyes (most vulnerable), nose (sensitive), face
- Punch, gouge, kick, stab
- Yell, scream, fight back with maximum aggression
- **Don't give up:** Your life depends on making bear decide you're not worth it

**Predatory Attack Signs:**
- Stalking (bear following you, circling)
- Silent approach (no huffing, no bluff charge warning)
- **Persistent attack** (doesn't stop despite resistance)
- Often at night or dawn/dusk
- Often lone bear (not sow with cubs)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Brown bear charge vs bluff charge body language, bear spray effective range/technique, attack response decision tree.

## 3. MOOSE AGGRESSION - Underestimated Danger

### Moose Attack Statistics
- **5-10 injuries per year in Alaska** (MORE than bear injuries)
- **Injuries often severe:** Trampling (broken bones, internal injuries)
- **Fatalities:** 1-2 per decade (rare, but severe injuries common)
- **Vehicle collisions:** 800+ per year (50-100 injuries, 5-10 deaths)

**Why moose are dangerous:**
- Size: 1000-1600 lbs (as big as brown bear)
- Unpredictable aggression
- Fast: 35 mph sprint
- Trampling attack: Front hooves (hard, powerful, deadly)
- People underestimate (moose look "cute," not predator-like)

---

### When Moose are AGGRESSIVE

**1. Cows with Calves (May-July):**
- EXTREMELY protective
- Will charge anything within 50 yards
- Calves can be hidden (you approach without seeing them)
- **Most dangerous time**

**2. Bulls in Rut (September-October):**
- Testosterone-driven aggression
- Irrational, unpredictable
- Will charge anything (including vehicles, trains, buildings)

**3. Deep Snow (Winter):**
- Stressed (energy conservation mode)
- Irritable (hard to move in deep snow)
- Less likely to flee (uses more energy)

**4. Habituated Moose (Urban/Suburban):**
- Lost fear of humans (Anchorage, Fairbanks suburbs)
- Come into yards (eat landscaping)
- Aggressive if approached

---

### Moose Warning Signs

**Pre-Charge Indicators:**
- **Ears pinned back** (flat against head)
- **Hackles raised** (hair standing up on back/neck)
- **Licking lips** (nervousness, aggression)
- **Head lowered** (preparing to charge)
- **Eyes wide, whites showing** (agitation)

**If you see these:** BACK AWAY immediately, put tree/obstacle between you and moose

---

### Moose Encounter Protocol

**Prevention:**
- **Give 50+ feet space** (minimum, 100+ if cow with calf or bull in rut)
- **Never approach:** For photos, closer look
- **Dogs:** Keep on leash (moose see dogs as wolves, will attack)
- **Urban:** Don't walk between moose and its path (they don't detour around you)

**If Moose Charges:**
1. **RUN** (different from bear - moose you CAN outmaneuver)
2. **Get behind tree, large rock, vehicle** (moose won't follow around obstacle)
3. **Keep obstacle between you and moose**
4. **If knocked down:**
   - Curl in ball (protect head, neck, internal organs)
   - Hands over head
   - Stay still (moose may stop trampling if you don't move)
5. **Wait for moose to leave** (several minutes, ensure it's gone)

**Moose vs Bear Encounters:**
- **Bear:** DON'T RUN (triggers chase)
- **Moose:** RUN and dodge (moose don't chase long, give up easily)

---

### Moose-Vehicle Collisions (DEADLY)

**Why So Dangerous:**
- Moose height: Legs hit bumper, 1000+ lb body comes through windshield at driver/passenger head level
- Dark brown (nearly invisible at night)
- Roads = salt (moose lick salt, hang out on roads)
- No reflective eye-shine (unlike deer - headlights don't reflect)

**High-Risk:**
- **Dawn/dusk:** Moose most active
- **Night:** Can't see them
- **Fall:** Rut (bulls roaming)
- **Winter:** Roads plowed (easier travel than deep snow)
- **Spring:** Calves (cows aggressive)

**Prevention:**
- Slow down in moose zones (road signs)
- High beams when no oncoming traffic
- Scan roadsides constantly (look for shape, movement)
- Extra caution dawn/dusk/night

**If Moose on Road:**
- **BRAKE, don't swerve** (ditch/tree worse than moose)
- Honk (may move, may not)
- Stop if necessary (wait for moose to leave)

**If Collision Imminent:**
- **Brake hard** (reduce speed as much as possible)
- **Duck below dashboard** (moose body comes through windshield)
- **Airbags will deploy** (good, but moose still dangerous)
- Brace for impact

**After Collision:**
- Check injuries
- **Exit carefully** (moose may still be alive, dangerous)
- Call emergency services
- **Don't approach moose** (even if injured, can still attack)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Moose warning sign body language, vehicle collision impact zone diagram, safe approach distance illustration.

## 4. ISOLATION & INJURY - The Silent Killer

### Alaska Size & Remoteness
- **663,300 square miles** (1/5 of entire continental US)
- **Population:** 730,000 (80% in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau)
- **Villages:** 200+ remote (no road access, fly-in only)
- **Wilderness:** 99% of Alaska has NO road access

**Reality:** If injured/sick in backcountry, you are DAYS to WEEKS from help

---

### Communication Challenges

**Cell Phones:**
- Coverage: Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, highways (limited)
- **99% of Alaska: NO CELL SERVICE**

**Satellite Phone (Essential):**
- Iridium (global coverage, works anywhere)
- Cost: $1000+ device, $50-150/month service
- **CRITICAL for backcountry:** Only reliable communication

**Personal Locator Beacon (PLB):**
- Emergency SOS (satellite)
- Search & Rescue alerted (coordinates sent)
- One-way (can't communicate, just SOS)
- No subscription (one-time purchase)
- **USE ONLY FOR LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY**

**VHF Radio:**
- Coast Guard (coastal, marine only)
- Limited range (line-of-sight, 5-20 miles)

**Inreach/Garmin:**
- Two-way satellite messaging
- SOS + text communication
- Popular with backcountry users

---

### Injury Scenarios (When Help is Days Away)

**Scenario 1: Broken Leg (100 miles from village)**
- Can't walk
- Sat phone call (if have one)
- Air rescue: $10,000-30,000+ (if weather allows)
- **If weather bad (whiteout, storm):** Wait days to weeks
- Must: Splint, pain management, shelter, water, food, WAIT

**Scenario 2: Bear Mauling (remote)**
- Severe bleeding, broken bones, shock
- Sat phone SOS
- Air rescue: Weather-dependent (may be hours to days)
- Must: Stop bleeding (tourniquet, pressure), treat shock, hypothermia prevention, STAY ALIVE until help arrives

**Scenario 3: Drowning/Cold Water Rescue**
- Remote river/lake
- Hypothermia onset in MINUTES (water temp 35-50°F)
- No cell service, no witnesses
- **Prevention critical:** PFD (Personal Flotation Device) MANDATORY, avoid solo travel

**Scenario 4: Heart Attack/Stroke**
- Medical emergency, need hospital ASAP
- Remote village: Clinic (basic), airlift to Anchorage/Fairbanks
- **If weather bad:** May die waiting for evacuation

---

### Survival Medicine (When No Help Coming)

**Priority Training:**
1. **Wilderness First Aid:** Minimum 16-hour course
2. **Wilderness First Responder (WFR):** 80-hour course (recommended)
3. **Wilderness EMT (WEMT):** 200+ hours (advanced)

**Key Skills for Alaska:**
- Stop bleeding (tourniquets, pressure dressings)
- Splinting (broken bones, dislocations)
- Hypothermia treatment (rewarming protocols)
- Cold injury (frostbite care)
- Shock management
- CPR
- Wound care (infection prevention)
- Evacuation (making litter, moving patient)

**Medical Kit (Alaska Backcountry - Extensive):**
- Trauma supplies (QuikClot, Israeli bandage, tourniquet)
- Splinting materials (SAM splint, tape, padding)
- Pain medication (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, stronger if prescribe)
- Antibiotics (prescription, for wound infection)
- Rewarming supplies (heat packs, sleeping bag rated -20°F+)
- Wound care (gauze, tape, antiseptic)
- CPR mask
- Thermometer (hypothermia check)
- **Sat phone or PLB** (CRITICAL)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Alaska isolation map (villages, road system, wilderness zones), injury response flowchart, wilderness medical kit contents.

## 5. COLD WATER DROWNING - Fast Killer

### Alaska Water Temperature (DEADLY Year-Round)

| Season | Ocean (Coastal) | Rivers (Interior) | Lakes | Survival Time |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------|---------------|
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | 45-55°F | 40-50°F | 50-60°F | 1-3 hours |
| Fall (Sep-Oct) | 40-50°F | 35-45°F | 40-50°F | 30-90 min |
| Winter (Nov-Apr) | 35-40°F | 32-35°F (under ice) | 32-35°F (ice) | 15-45 min |
| Spring (May-Jun) | 40-45°F | 35-45°F (snowmelt) | 35-50°F | 30-90 min |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Water NEVER gets warm in Alaska (even summer = hypothermia risk)

---

### Cold Water Immersion Stages (Alaska Timeline)

**Stage 1: Cold Shock (0-3 minutes)**
- Gasp reflex (involuntary inhalation)
- Hyperventilation (can't control breathing)
- Panic
- **Drowning risk:** If head underwater during gasp = drown immediately
- **Action:** FLOAT (don't swim yet), get breathing under control, stay calm

**Stage 2: Swim Failure (3-30 minutes)**
- Muscles cool, lose strength
- Coordination fails (can't swim effectively)
- Exhaustion
- **Drowning risk:** Can't keep head above water
- **Action:** Minimize movement (conserve heat), signal for help, try to get out or onto floating object

**Stage 3: Hypothermia (30+ minutes)**
- Core temperature drops (mild → severe)
- Shivering, then stops
- Confusion, loss of consciousness
- **Death:** If not rescued
- **Action:** Must be rescued (can't self-rescue at this point)

**Stage 4: Circum-Rescue Collapse (During/After Rescue)**
- Sudden cardiac arrest when pulled from water
- Caused by: Shift in blood pressure, cold blood from limbs returning to heart
- **Protocol:** Horizontal rescue (keep victim level), gentle handling, immediate rewarming

---

### Alaska River Hazards (Specific)

**Glacial Melt Rivers:**
- Silty (milky-white color from rock flour)
- **FAST current:** 5-10 mph (faster than you can swim)
- **COLD:** 35-40°F (even summer)
- **Shallow channels shift:** Braided rivers (unstable banks)
- **Dangerous crossings:** Depth deceptive, current strong

**River Crossing Protocol:**
- **Scout first:** Look for wide, shallow, slow sections
- **Unclip pack waist belt:** (can jettison if swept away)
- **Face upstream, side-step across:** Angle 45° downstream
- **Use pole:** Trekking pole, staff (3 points of contact)
- **Group crossing:** Link arms, strongest upstream
- **Don't cross if:** Deep (>thigh), fast current (visible whitewater), cold (numbness in seconds)

**If Swept Away:**
- Jettison pack (weight = drown)
- Float on back, feet downstream (absorb impacts with legs, not head)
- Angle toward shore (backpaddle 45°)
- Don't try to stand (foot entrapment - underwater rocks trap foot, current pushes you under)

---

### Prevention (MANDATORY)

**Personal Flotation Device (PFD):**
- Type III or V (paddling-specific)
- Worn AT ALL TIMES on water (not in boat, ON YOU)
- Even strong swimmers drown in cold water (hypothermia = swim failure)

**Dry Suit (Cold Water):**
- Waterproof, sealed suit
- Extends survival time 3-5x
- Expensive ($500-1500), but worth it for cold water

**Avoid Solo Water Travel:**
- Buddy system (at least 2 people, preferably 3-4)
- If one person in water, others rescue

**Know Your Limits:**
- Alaska water is DEADLY (not like lower 48)
- Respect even small streams (fast, cold)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Cold water immersion timeline, river crossing technique illustration, PFD types and proper fit.

## 6. WILD POTATO (Hedysarum alpinum) - "Into the Wild" WARNING

### Chris McCandless Death (1992)
- **Location:** Abandoned bus, Stampede Trail, Denali area
- **Cause:** Starvation, exacerbated by poisoning from wild potato SEEDS
- **Timeline:** April-August 1992 (112 days in wilderness)
- **Mistake:** Ate wild potato seeds (not roots)

**Book/Movie:** "Into the Wild" (Jon Krakauer) - made this plant famous/infamous

---

### Wild Potato (Hedysarum alpinum) - Safe vs Deadly

**ROOT (Safe, Edible):**
- Tuberous root (looks like small potato)
- Starchy, nutritious (400-500 cal/lb)
- Traditional Native Alaskan food (Athabascan, Inuit)
- **Harvest timing:** July-August (before seeds form)
- **Preparation:** Cook (like potato), can be eaten raw

**SEED (DEADLY TOXIC):**
- Contains: β-N-Oxalyl-L-α-β-diaminopropionic acid (ODAP) - neurotoxin
- Causes: Lathyrism (neurodegenerative disease)
- **Symptoms:**
  - Weakness, paralysis (legs first)
  - Inability to stand, walk
  - Starvation exacerbation (body can't metabolize protein effectively)
  - Progressive (worsens over days/weeks)
- **No antidote**
- **Fatal:** If combined with starvation, dehydration

**Research (Post-McCandless):**
- Seeds contain ODAP (confirmed 2015)
- Concentration higher in drought conditions
- Even small amounts dangerous (cumulative effect)
- McCandless ate seeds for weeks (thought they were safe)

---

### Positive Identification (CRITICAL)

**Hedysarum alpinum (Eskimo Potato - CORRECT):**
- Compound leaves (5-13 leaflets, paired)
- Purple/pink flowers (pea family)
- Tuberous root (edible)
- **Seeds:** AVOID COMPLETELY

**Hedysarum mackenzii (Look-alike, ALSO TOXIC):**
- Similar appearance
- Seeds ALSO contain ODAP
- AVOID

**Positive ID:**
- Must be 100% certain (consult field guide, local expert)
- Harvest ROOTS ONLY (July-August, before flowering/seeds)
- **If seeds present: DO NOT EAT PLANT** (even roots - risk of seed contamination)

---

### Survival Protocol

**If You Must Forage Wild Potato:**
1. **ROOTS ONLY, NEVER SEEDS**
2. Harvest early season (July-August, before seeds)
3. Wash thoroughly (remove any seed contamination)
4. Cook (safer than raw)
5. Eat in moderation (not sole food source)

**If Symptoms Develop (weakness, paralysis):**
- STOP eating wild potato immediately
- Increase protein from other sources (fish, meat)
- Hydrate aggressively
- Seek medical help (if possible)
- **This is serious:** Can lead to permanent paralysis

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Wild potato root vs seed comparison, plant identification (Hedysarum alpinum), Chris McCandless timeline and warning infographic.

## Regional Hazard Summary

### Monthly Hazard Calendar

| Month | Primary Threats | Secondary Threats | Activity Guidance |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Jan | Extreme cold (-40°F+), darkness (polar night in Arctic) | Equipment failure, isolation | Most dangerous month, stay in shelter |
| Feb | Extreme cold, darkness | Blizzards, isolation | Still very dangerous |
| Mar | Blizzards, cold, avalanches (spring breakup) | Daylight returning (psychological relief) | Winter conditions continue |
| Apr | Cold, avalanches, "breakup" (river ice) | Flooding (snowmelt), starvation time (food depleted) | Spring transition, still dangerous |
| May | Brown bears emerge, moose (calves), cold water | Flooding, avalanches | Wildlife active, water hazards |
| Jun | Brown bears (active), cold water, mosquitoes | Midnight sun (sleep disruption), wild potato seeds | Summer season begins, bear encounters peak |
| Jul | Brown bears (salmon runs), mosquitoes, cold water | Wild potato seeds, river drownings | Peak summer, high bear activity |
| Aug | Brown bears (salmon), cold water | Early snow (high elevations), berries (bear competition) | Late summer, prepare for fall |
| Sep | Brown bears (fattening), moose (rut), early snow | Cold, avalanches begin | Fall transition, aggressive wildlife |
| Oct | Early winter (snow, cold), brown bears (pre-hibernation), moose (rut) | Equipment failure | Winter returns |
| Nov | Extreme cold, darkness returns, blizzards | Brown bears (late hibernation), isolation | Full winter mode, polar night begins |
| Dec | Extreme cold, darkness (polar night), blizzards | Equipment failure, isolation | Darkest, coldest time, highest danger |

### Survival Priority by Threat

**Immediate Life Threat (Minutes-Hours):**
1. Cold water immersion (40-50°F water) - 30-90 minutes to death
2. Extreme cold exposure (-40°F+, no shelter) - Hours to death
3. Brown bear attack - Seconds to severe injury/death
4. Moose attack - Seconds to severe injury
5. Whiteout blizzard (disorientation) - Hours to death from hypothermia

**Acute Threat (Hours-Days):**
6. Frostbite (-40°F+, exposed skin) - Minutes to injury, hours to amputation decision
7. Injury with no help (broken bone, bleeding) - Days to infection/death
8. River drowning (glacial melt, fast current) - Minutes

**Chronic Threat (Days-Weeks):**
9. Starvation (failed hunting/fishing, spring) - Weeks to death
10. Wild potato seed poisoning (ODAP) - Weeks to paralysis
11. Isolation (medical emergency, bad weather delays rescue) - Days to weeks
