summary: 'Camas (Camassia quamash) was a dietary staple for Pacific Northwest tribes. The bulb is sweet and nutritious when cooked (pit-roasted for 1-3 days). CRITICAL: Death camas is a deadly look-alike.
  Only harvest camas when flowers are present for positive ID.'
warnings:
- DEATH CAMAS (Zigadenus) is DEADLY and looks nearly identical to camas when not flowering
- NEVER harvest camas bulbs unless you have seen the plant in flower and are 100 percent certain
- Raw camas bulbs cause severe digestive upset — MUST be cooked
- Camas takes 1-3 days of pit-roasting to break down inulin (complex carb) into digestible sugars
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION (when flowering): FLOWERS: deep blue-purple, star-shaped, 6 petals, tall spike (1-2 feet). Blooms April-June. LEAVES: grass-like, basal. BULB: onion-like but NO ONION SMELL. HABITAT: wet
  meadows, prairies. DEATH CAMAS: cream/white flowers, also star-shaped. If flowers are not blue, DO NOT HARVEST.'
- 'HARVEST: Dig bulbs after flowering, summer into fall. Bulbs are 1-2 inches, layered like onion. Sustainable harvest: take no more than 10 percent from a patch, replant small bulbs.'
- 'PREPARATION (traditional pit-roasting): Dig pit, line with rocks, heat rocks with fire for hours. Layer: hot rocks, grass/leaves, camas bulbs, more grass, dirt to seal. Cook 1-3 days (slow roasting converts
  inulin to fructose). Result: sweet, molasses-like flavor. Can be eaten immediately or dried for storage.'
- 'MODERN COOKING: Steam or boil for 2-4 hours until bulbs are soft and sweet. Or wrap in foil and roast in coals overnight.'
- 'NUTRITIONAL VALUE: High in carbohydrates (inulin becomes fructose when cooked). Sweet like sweet potato. Historically a calorie staple for winter.'
- 'STORAGE: Dried roasted camas lasts months to years. Grind into flour or rehydrate for eating.'

# Camas — Staple Root Crop of Indigenous PNW

Camas (Camassia quamash) was a dietary staple for Pacific Northwest tribes. The bulb is sweet and nutritious when cooked (pit-roasted for 1-3 days). CRITICAL: Death camas is a deadly look-alike. Only harvest camas when flowers are present for positive ID.
