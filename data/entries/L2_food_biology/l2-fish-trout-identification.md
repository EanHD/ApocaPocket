summary: 'Trout (rainbow, brook, brown, cutthroat) are widespread freshwater fish
  in cold streams and lakes. Excellent eating, relatively easy to catch. Highly prized
  for flavor and nutrition. Must be cleaned and cooked thoroughly. Learn to identify
  species by coloration, spotting pattern, and habitat.'
warnings:
- Raw or undercooked fish can carry parasites (tapeworms, roundworms) - cook to 145°F
  internal temp
- Trout from polluted waters accumulate toxins and heavy metals - avoid fish downstream
  of industry, mines, agriculture runoff
- Brook trout are native only in eastern North America - introduced elsewhere
- Some waters require fishing licenses even in survival situations (check local laws
  if applicable)
- Remove gills completely - they spoil quickly and taint meat
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION - RAINBOW TROUT (Oncorhynchus mykiss): Pink to red horizontal stripe
  along lateral line. Black spots on back, sides, dorsal fin, and tail. Silver sides,
  greenish back. 8-20 inches (wild), up to 30+ inches (sea-run steelhead). HABITAT:
  Cold streams, rivers, lakes. Native to Pacific coast, introduced worldwide.'
- 'IDENTIFICATION - BROOK TROUT (Salvelinus fontinalis): Worm-like vermiculations
  (squiggly patterns) on back and dorsal fin. Red spots with blue halos on sides.
  White leading edges on lower fins (pectoral, pelvic, anal) with black stripe behind.
  Red/orange belly (especially males in fall). 6-16 inches. HABITAT: Cold, clean
  streams and beaver ponds. Native to eastern North America.'
- 'IDENTIFICATION - BROWN TROUT (Salmo trutta): Brown or golden body. Large black
  and red spots on sides (red spots have pale halos). Few or no spots on tail. White-edged
  adipose fin. 10-25 inches. HABITAT: Streams, rivers, lakes. Native to Europe, introduced
  North America. More tolerant of warm water than other trout.'
- 'IDENTIFICATION - CUTTHROAT TROUT (Oncorhynchus clarkii): Red to orange "slash"
  marks under jaw (looks like cut throat - namesake). Black spots concentrated toward
  tail. Multiple subspecies with varying coloration. 8-18 inches. HABITAT: Western
  North America streams and lakes. Various subspecies (coastal, westslope, Yellowstone,
  etc.).'
- 'FIELD DRESSING (Clean within 1-2 hours of catch in warm weather): (1) Insert knife
  at vent (anus), cut forward to gills (shallow cut to avoid puncturing intestines).
  (2) Reach in and pull out all internal organs (heart, liver, intestines, stomach).
  Discard or use as trap bait. (3) Cut out gills completely (spoil quickly). (4)
  Scrape out kidney (dark red line along backbone) with thumbnail or spoon. (5) Rinse
  body cavity thoroughly with clean cold water. (6) Pat dry. (7) Optional: remove
  head and tail to save space. Keep fish cool and dry.'
- 'COOKING METHODS: (1) GRILLING/OPEN FIRE: Gut fish, scale if desired (or remove
  skin after cooking). Stuff cavity with wild onions/herbs and salt if available.
  Wrap in large leaves (grape, burdock, plantain) or aluminum foil. Place on coals
  or grill 5-10 min per side until flesh flakes. (2) FRYING: Fillet fish (cut along
  backbone, remove ribs). Coat in flour/cornmeal if available. Fry in fat/oil until
  golden and flaky (3-5 min per side). (3) BOILING/STEW: Add whole gutted fish or
  chunks to boiling water/stew. Cook 10-15 min. (4) SMOKING: See preservation entries.
  Target internal temp: 145°F (flesh flakes easily when done, opaque throughout).'
- 'YIELDS AND PORTIONS: Whole fish is ~60% edible meat (after gutting, heading, removing
  fins). 1-pound trout yields ~10oz of meat. Plan 8-12 oz whole fish per person per
  meal. A 12-inch trout weighs ~12 oz whole, yields ~7oz meat (150-200 calories,
  25-30g protein).'
- 'NUTRITIONAL VALUE (per 100g cooked trout): Calories: 190, Protein: 26g (excellent
  quality), Fat: 8g (rich in omega-3 fatty acids EPA & DHA - heart/brain health),
  Vitamin D: 5-10 mcg (50-100% DV), Vitamin B12: 5mcg (200% DV), Selenium: 15mcg.
  One of the healthiest wild foods. Excellent survival food - easy to catch, nutritious.'
- 'STORAGE: FRESH: Clean immediately, keep cold (33-40°F). Use within 24 hours in
  field conditions (48 hours if well-iced). Fish spoils quickly - smell test (fresh
  fish smells mild/ocean-like, spoiled fish smells strongly fishy/ammonia). SMOKED:
  Lasts 1-2 weeks unrefrigerated if fully smoked/dried. FROZEN: Lasts 6-8 months.'

  red belly. BROWN TROUT: brown/gold with red/black spots, white-edged spots. CUTTHROAT: red slash under jaw. HABITAT: cold streams, rivers, mountain lakes.'
- 'FIELD DRESSING: (1) Cut from vent (anus) to gills. (2) Remove guts (discard or use as bait). (3) Cut out gills. (4) Rinse cavity with clean water. (5) Optional: remove head and tail. Dressed fish can

- 'NUTRITION: High protein (20g per 4oz), omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, B vitamins. Excellent survival food.'
