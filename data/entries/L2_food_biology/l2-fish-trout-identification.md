summary: Trout (rainbow, brook, brown, cutthroat) are widespread freshwater fish in cold streams and lakes. Excellent eating, relatively easy to catch. Must be cleaned and cooked thoroughly. Learn to identify
  by coloration and habitat.
warnings:
- Raw or undercooked fish can carry parasites - cook to 145F internal temp
- Trout from polluted waters accumulate toxins - avoid fish downstream of industry
- Brook trout are native only in eastern North America - introduced elsewhere
- Some waters require fishing licenses even in survival situations (check local laws)
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Body shape: streamlined, torpedo-shaped. Size: 8-30 inches. RAINBOW TROUT: pink stripe along side, black spots on back/tail. BROOK TROUT: worm-like markings on back, white edges on fins,
  red belly. BROWN TROUT: brown/gold with red/black spots, white-edged spots. CUTTHROAT: red slash under jaw. HABITAT: cold streams, rivers, mountain lakes.'
- 'FIELD DRESSING: (1) Cut from vent (anus) to gills. (2) Remove guts (discard or use as bait). (3) Cut out gills. (4) Rinse cavity with clean water. (5) Optional: remove head and tail. Dressed fish can
  be cooked immediately or preserved.'
- 'COOKING: (1) Grilling: gut fish, stuff cavity with herbs/salt, wrap in leaves or foil, cook over coals 5-10 min per side. (2) Frying: fillet, coat in flour, fry in fat. (3) Boiling: add to stew. (4)
  Smoking: see preservation entry. Internal temp 145F (flesh flakes easily).'
- 'NUTRITION: High protein (20g per 4oz), omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, B vitamins. Excellent survival food.'
