summary: "Wetland supermarket plant - nearly every part is edible year-round. Called\
  \ the 'supermarket of the swamp.' Rhizomes provide starch, shoots are eaten like\
  \ asparagus, pollen is protein-rich flour supplement, immature flower spikes like\
  \ corn on the cob. One of the most valuable wild food plants."
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: HEIGHT: 5-10 feet tall perennial. LEAVES: Long (3-9 feet), narrow (1/2-1 inch wide), flat, sword-like, parallel veins, emerge from base. Blue-green to gray-green. Cross-section is slightly curved (not round). FLOWER/SEED HEAD: Distinctive brown cylindrical "hot dog" seed head (4-8 inches long, 1 inch diameter) on tall stalk above leaves. Male flowers (pollen) on spike above female (seed head) in early summer. RHIZOMES: Thick horizontal underground stems (1-2 inches diameter), white inside, grow in mud. HABITAT: Marshes, pond edges, ditches, slow streams. Roots in standing water or saturated soil.'
- 'SPRING HARVEST (March-May): YOUNG SHOOTS (best part): Harvest when 1-2 feet tall. Pull from base or cut below water. Peel away outer layers to reveal white inner core (like heart of palm). Eat raw (crunchy, cucumber-like) or cooked (boiled, sautéed like asparagus). Excellent survival food. YOUNG FLOWER STALKS: Before flowers emerge, cut developing flower stalk. Peel and eat inner core raw or cooked.'
- 'EARLY SUMMER HARVEST (June-early July): IMMATURE FLOWER SPIKES: Green flower heads before pollen release. Harvest when still tightly wrapped in leaf sheath. Boil or steam 10-15 minutes, eat like corn on the cob (scrape off flowers with teeth). Starchy, corn-like flavor.'
- 'MID-SUMMER HARVEST (July-August): POLLEN: Shake ripe yellow pollen from male flower spike into bag or container. Use as flour supplement (mix 1:3 with regular flour) for protein and golden color. High in protein. Gives pancakes/bread distinctive yellow color and nutty flavor.'
- 'FALL/WINTER HARVEST (September-March): RHIZOMES (best in fall/winter when starch is stored): Dig rhizomes from mud (waders or hip boots helpful). Wash thoroughly. METHOD 1 - Roast/boil whole: Peel outer skin, eat inner white core (fibrous - chew to extract starch, spit out fibers). METHOD 2 - Extract starch (better): Peel, crush/mash in cold water, let starch settle (30+ min), pour off water, collect white starch sediment. Dry and use as flour (pure starch, gluten-free). Yields are excellent - one day of digging can provide weeks of starch.'
- 'NUTRITIONAL VALUE: SHOOTS: High in vitamins A and C, minerals. Low calorie. POLLEN: 15-25% protein (higher than wheat flour ~10%), amino acids, vitamins, minerals. RHIZOME STARCH: Pure carbohydrate (similar to potato starch), ~30% of rhizome weight. FLOWER SPIKES: Starchy carbohydrate, fiber.'
- 'IDENTIFICATION vs TOXIC LOOKALIKES: POISON IRIS (Iris species) - TOXIC: Leaves have DISTINCT MIDRIB down center (cattail has parallel veins, no midrib). Iris leaves fan out from base (cattail leaves wrap around each other). Iris has showy flowers (blue, purple, yellow) - cattail has brown spike. If you see midrib or fan arrangement, DO NOT EAT. SWEET FLAG (Acorus calamus): Similar leaves but CRINKLED edges and AROMATIC (spicy smell). Mildly toxic in large amounts. No seed head.'
- 'PROCESSING TIPS: Harvest rhizomes in winter for best starch content. Wash thoroughly - mud harbors bacteria. Peel shoots completely to inner white core - outer layers are tough. Collect pollen on dry sunny day for best yield. Store dried pollen in airtight container (refrigerate for long-term).'
- 'REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION: Broadleaf cattail (T. latifolia): North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia. Nearly worldwide in temperate zones. Narrowleaf cattail (T. angustifolia): Similar range, slightly more southern. Both species edible and used identically. Hybrid (T. x glauca) also common and edible.'
warnings:
- Confirm wetland is not contaminated with industrial runoff, sewage, agricultural chemicals, or heavy metals - cattails bioaccumulate pollutants.
- "Wild iris (TOXIC) grows in similar habitats \u2014 iris leaves have a distinct\
  \ midrib and fan arrangement vs cattail's linear parallel veins."
- Harvest rhizomes carefully - hip boots and caution needed in deep water/mud.
- Some people sensitive to pollen - test small amount first.
- Cooking immature flower spikes is essential - do not eat raw.

## Overview
Wetland staple plant; nearly every part is edible across seasons. Rhizomes provide starch, shoots are eaten like asparagus, pollen is a protein-rich flour supplement.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify by tall linear leaves, distinctive brown cylindrical seed head, and wetland habitat.
2. Spring: harvest young shoots when under 60cm — peel and eat raw or cooked.
3. Early summer: collect green flower spikes, boil like corn.
4. Mid-summer: shake pollen from male spike into bag for flour.
5. Fall/winter: dig rhizomes, wash, crush in water, settle starch.

## Warnings
- Confirm wetland is not contaminated with industrial runoff or sewage.
- Wild iris (toxic) grows in similar habitats — iris leaves have a distinct midrib and fan arrangement vs cattail's linear wrap.
