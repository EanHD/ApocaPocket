summary: Catfish (Ictalurus and related species) are bottom-dwelling fish with whisker-like barbels. Easy to catch (scavengers, eat almost anything). No scales but have tough skin. Excellent eating when
  cleaned properly.
warnings:
- Catfish have sharp spines on dorsal and pectoral fins - puncture wounds can become infected, handle carefully
- Bottom feeders from polluted water accumulate toxins - avoid catfish from industrial/urban waters
- Skin is tough and slimy - requires pliers or skinning technique
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Flattened head, 8 barbels (whiskers), no scales, smooth slimy skin. Dorsal and pectoral fins have sharp spines. Color varies (brown, yellow, gray). Size: 1-50 lbs. HABITAT: rivers, lakes,
  ponds, muddy bottoms. Worldwide distribution.'
- 'FIELD DRESSING: (1) Kill immediately (nail through head). (2) Gut fish. (3) SKINNING: Catfish must be skinned (no scales). Cut around head and along dorsal fin. Use pliers to peel skin toward tail. Or
  nail head to tree, pull skin with pliers.'
- 'REMOVING SPINES: Cut off dorsal and pectoral fins (spines are embedded in fins, not the body).'
- 'COOKING: Fillet or cook whole. Firm white meat, mild flavor. Fry (Southern classic), bake, or smoke. Cook to 145F.'
- 'NUTRITION: High protein, low fat. Firm texture makes it good for stews.'
