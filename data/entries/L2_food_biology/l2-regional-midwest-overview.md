## Water Sources & Purification

### Water Availability (Seasonal)

**Spring (March-May):**
- **Abundant:** Snowmelt, spring rains, flooding
- **Quality:** Good (cold temperatures slow bacteria)
- **Concern:** Agricultural runoff (fertilizers, pesticides)

**Summer (June-August):**
- **Variable:** Drought possible in western Midwest (prairie)
- **Quality:** Moderate (warm water, algae blooms)
- **Concern:** Stagnant ponds (bacteria), livestock contamination

**Fall (September-November):**
- **Abundant:** Rain, but decreasing
- **Quality:** Good (cooling temperatures)
- **Concern:** Leaf tannins (harmless but discolors water)

**Winter (December-February):**
- **Frozen:** Surface water ice-covered (12-36 inches thick)
- **Quality:** Excellent (no bacterial growth)
- **Concern:** Energy cost to melt ice/snow (BTU intensive)

### Source Types

**Rivers & Streams:**
- Abundant in eastern/northern Midwest
- Freeze solid in far north (Minnesota, North Dakota)
- Flow continues under ice in larger rivers
- **Best locations:** Fast-flowing sections (less likely to freeze completely)

**Lakes & Ponds:**
- Great Lakes never freeze completely (except shallow bays)
- Small ponds freeze solid (ice fishing)
- **Ice holes:** Must maintain (re-clear daily as ice reforms)

**Springs:**
- Reliable year-round (groundwater doesn't freeze)
- Harder to locate (often in valleys, hillsides)
- **Best winter source** (liquid water without melting ice)

**Snow/Ice (Winter):**
- 10:1 ratio (10 cups snow = 1 cup water)
- High energy cost (melting consumes firewood/fuel)
- Compacted snow or clear ice = more efficient than fluffy snow
- **Never eat snow directly** (hypothermia risk, energy loss)

### Purification Methods

**Priority (Year-round):**
1. **Boil:** 1 minute rolling boil (3 minutes above 5000 ft)
2. **Filter:** 0.2-micron filter (removes bacteria, parasites, not viruses)
3. **Chemical:** Iodine/chlorine tablets (30-60 minutes, less effective in cold)

**Cold Weather Considerations:**
- Iodine tablets ineffective below 40°F (need 60+ minutes)
- Filters can freeze and crack (store in clothing/sleeping bag)
- Boiling is MOST reliable (always works)

**Giardia & Cryptosporidium:** Present in Midwest surface water (beaver fever)
- Causes severe diarrhea (life-threatening if dehydrated)
- Boiling kills both
- Filters remove both (0.2 micron or smaller)
- Iodine kills Giardia but NOT Cryptosporidium reliably

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Winter water access methods (ice hole, spring location), water source safety by season table.

## Shelter Construction

### Climate Requirements (by season)

**Summer Shelter (June-August):**
- Minimal insulation (heat is enemy)
- Ventilation priority
- Shade from sun
- Mosquito protection (especially near water)
- Storm protection (severe thunderstorms)

**Winter Shelter (December-February):**
- **MAXIMUM insulation** (survival priority)
- Heat retention (thermal mass)
- Wind protection (north side especially)
- Small interior space (easier to heat)
- Snow load capacity (roof must support 2-4 ft snow)
- Ventilation for fire (carbon monoxide risk)

### Winter Shelter Types

#### Heated Cabin/Dugout (Long-term)
```
Design: Semi-underground or well-insulated structure
- Walls: 12-18 inches thick (logs, sod, earth)
- Insulation: Packed earth, hay, snow (yes, snow insulates)
- Roof: Strong (support 4+ ft snow load = 40-60 lbs per sq ft)
- Floor: Raised or excavated below frost line (warmer)
- Heat source: Wood stove or stone fireplace (CRITICAL)
- Chimney: Must draft well (avoid carbon monoxide buildup)
- Size: Small = easier to heat (8x10 ft for 1 person)
- Door: Double-door entry (airlock reduces heat loss)
- Windows: Small, south-facing (sunlight), shuttered at night
```

**R-Value Target:** R-30 to R-50 (similar to modern home in Minnesota)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Cross-section of winter dugout shelter showing insulation layers, airflow, heat source positioning.

#### Quinzee (Emergency, 1-3 nights)
```
Design: Hollowed-out snow pile
- Pile snow into dome (6-8 ft high, 8-10 ft diameter)
- Wait 2-4 hours (snow compacts/hardens)
- Hollow out interior (12-18 inch walls)
- Ventilation hole at top (CRITICAL - CO2 buildup)
- Entrance below sleeping platform (cold air sinks)
- Interior temp: 20-40°F (warm compared to -20°F outside)
```

**Requirements:**
- Enough snow (3+ ft depth)
- Shovel or digging tool
- 4-6 hours to build
- Sleeping pad (insulation from ground)

**Advantage:** Can be built anywhere with snow, no materials needed

#### Snow Cave (Northern Minnesota, Michigan UP)
```
Design: Excavated into snowbank/drift
- Find deep drift (6+ ft)
- Tunnel horizontally into drift
- Excavate chamber inside
- Sleeping platform raised above entrance
- Ventilation hole through roof
- Block entrance with snow block (leave gap at bottom)
```

**Faster than quinzee** (1-2 hours) but requires large snowdrift.

### Insulation Materials (Winter)

**Best to Worst:**
1. **Goose/duck down:** R-value 5-7 per inch (best, hard to obtain)
2. **Dry grass/hay:** R-value 1.5-2 per inch (abundant in prairie)
3. **Cattail fluff:** R-value 2-3 per inch (marshes)
4. **Dry leaves:** R-value 1-2 per inch (forests, packs down over time)
5. **Pine needles:** R-value 1-1.5 per inch (evergreen forests)
6. **Snow:** R-value 1 per inch (counterintuitive but true - igloo principle)
7. **Moss:** R-value 0.5-1 per inch (northern forests, holds moisture)

**Critical Rule:** Must be DRY. Wet insulation = no insulation.

### Summer Shelter (Simple)

```
Design: Open-air lean-to or platform
- Framework: Branches, saplings
- Roof: Bark, large leaves, grass thatch
- Sides: Open (airflow) or screened (mosquitoes)
- Floor: Elevated 6-12 inches (snakes, insects, ground moisture)
- Location: Near water, breezy hilltop (insects reduced)
```

**Priority:** Mosquito protection > rain protection (summer rain is warm)

### Tornado Shelter (Spring/Summer)

```
Design: Underground or reinforced basement
- Below ground level (ideally)
- Reinforced ceiling (won't collapse from debris)
- Interior location (no windows)
- Southwest corner of basement (traditional, tornado approach direction)
- Supplies stored: Water, first aid, flashlight, radio
```

**Above-ground alternative:**
- Interior bathroom or closet (small room, plumbing adds structure)
- Lowest floor, away from exterior walls
- Cover with mattress/cushions

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Underground root cellar design (dual-purpose food storage/tornado shelter), quinzee construction steps.

## Fire Making & Management

### Wood Selection (BTU & Characteristics)

| Wood Type | BTU/cord | Burn Rate | Coals | Split Difficulty | Availability |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Oak (red, white) | 24-30M | Slow | Excellent | Hard | Very common (east) |
| Hickory | 28-30M | Slow | Excellent | Hard | Common (east) |
| Maple (sugar, red) | 24-27M | Moderate | Very good | Moderate | Very common |
| Ash | 24-25M | Moderate | Very good | Easy | Common |
| Elm | 20-22M | Slow | Good | VERY HARD (stringy) | Common |
| Cottonwood | 13-16M | Fast | Poor | Easy | Very common (rivers) |
| Willow | 14-18M | Fast | Poor | Easy | Common (wet areas) |
| Pine/Spruce | 15-18M | Fast | Poor | Easy | Common (north) |

**Best all-around:** Ash (splits easy, burns hot, burns even when green)  
**Emergency:** Cottonwood (abundant near rivers, easy to cut, but low BTU)

### Winter Fire Strategy

**Heat Requirements:**
- **Space heating:** 10,000-30,000 BTU/hour (depending on shelter size, outside temp)
- **Wood consumption:** 4-8 cords per winter (Nov-Mar, 5 months)
- **1 cord = 128 cubic feet** (4ft x 4ft x 8ft stack)

**Daily Routine (Winter):**
```
Morning (6 AM): Stoke fire from coals (add kindling, small splits)
Morning (8 AM): Load fire with large splits (3-4 hours burn)
Midday (12 PM): Reload fire
Afternoon (4 PM): Reload fire (banking coals for night)
Evening (8 PM): Bank fire (large splits, damper down for slow burn)
Overnight: Fire burns down to coals (cold but safer than open flame)
```

**Banking a Fire (Overnight):**
1. Build up large coal bed (1-2 hours before sleep)
2. Add largest splits you have (6-8 inch diameter)
3. Arrange tightly (reduces airflow)
4. Damper down (reduces draft, slows burn)
5. Result: Smoldering coals in morning (easy to restart)

### Fire Safety (Winter Shelters)

**Carbon Monoxide Danger:**
- **ALWAYS have ventilation** (chimney + fresh air intake)
- Symptoms: Headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion
- Kills while you sleep (odorless, colorless)
- **Prevention:** Chimney that drafts well, crack window/vent for fresh air

**Chimney Fires:**
- Creosote buildup in chimney (from softwood smoke, incomplete combustion)
- Ignites suddenly (sounds like freight train)
- Can spread to structure
- **Prevention:** Burn hot fires (not smoldering), use hardwoods, clean chimney

**Structure Fires:**
- Keep flammable materials 3+ feet from stove
- Metal or stone floor under stove
- Check for sparks (use spark screen on fireplace)
- Have water/snow nearby (emergency dousing)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Fire lay for long-burn (overnight), proper chimney design and draft, wood storage and seasoning.

## Seasonal Survival Strategies

### Spring (March-May)

**Advantages:**
- Temperature moderating (40-70°F)
- Days lengthening (10 → 14 hours daylight)
- Plant growth begins (greens available)
- Fish spawn (excellent fishing)
- Waterfowl migration (ducks, geese)
- Turkey season (most states)

**Challenges:**
- **TORNADO SEASON** (peak April-May)
- Flooding from snowmelt (rivers over banks)
- Mud everywhere (freeze/thaw cycles)
- Ice-out on lakes (dangerous, thin ice)
- Rapid weather changes (70°F → 30°F in 12 hours possible)

**Priorities:**
- Repair shelter from winter damage
- Restock firewood (before summer heat)
- Forage greens (vitamin C after winter)
- Fish spawning runs
- Plant garden if long-term (corn, beans, squash)
- **Tornado awareness:** Have shelter plan, monitor weather

**Tornado Drill:**
- Identify shelter location NOW (before season)
- Practice getting there quickly
- Store supplies (water, first aid, radio)
- Monitor weather daily (NOAA radio critical)

### Summer (June-August)

**Advantages:**
- Long days (15+ hours daylight)
- Warm/hot (70-90°F, no heating needed)
- Plant foods abundant (berries, greens)
- Fishing excellent (warm water, active fish)
- Growing season (gardens thrive)
- Travel easy (dry ground, no snow)

**Challenges:**
- Heat waves (100°F+ possible, especially prairie)
- Severe thunderstorms (hail, damaging winds)
- Flash flooding (intense rain)
- Tornadoes (still possible into June)
- Mosquitoes (wetlands, woods)
- Ticks (Lyme disease, RMSF)
- Drought possible (western Midwest)

**Priorities:**
- **Water security** (streams can dry up in drought)
- Berry harvest (mid-summer)
- Fishing (preserve by smoking/drying)
- Build/improve shelter (before winter)
- Collect insulation materials (grass, cattail)
- **Tick checks daily** (remove within 24 hours = lower Lyme risk)

### Fall (September-November)

**Advantages:**
- **HARVEST SEASON** (nuts, wild rice, game)
- Cooling temperatures (60-70°F → 30-50°F)
- Clear weather (beautiful season)
- Deer hunting (November)
- Waterfowl hunting (migration)
- Fish active before winter

**Challenges:**
- Rapidly shortening days (14 → 9 hours)
- First frost (kills plants, ends foraging)
- Freezes begin (water access hardens)
- Early blizzards possible (November)
- Hypothermia risk (people unprepared for cold)

**Priorities:**
- **CRITICAL: Nut collection** (acorns, hickory, walnuts - winter calories)
- Wild rice harvest (August-September, Minnesota/Wisconsin)
- Deer hunting (late season, winter meat supply)
- Firewood collection (MINIMUM 4 cords, more if possible)
- Shelter winterization (insulation, chinking gaps, roof repair)
- Smoke/dry meat (preservation for winter)
- Move perishables to cool storage (root cellar)

**Rule of thumb:** If you're not ready for winter by November 1, you're behind.

### Winter (December-February)

**Advantages:**
- Ice fishing (Great Lakes, ponds - excellent protein)
- Snow tracking (easy to find game trails)
- Meat preservation (natural refrigeration)
- No insects (mosquitoes, ticks gone)
- Clear skies (when not snowing)

**Challenges:**
- **EXTREME COLD:** -20°F to -40°F possible, wind chill -60°F
- Blizzards (whiteout, impassable for days)
- Short days (9 hours daylight, 15 hours dark)
- Frozen water (must melt ice/snow)
- Limited food (no plants, game scarce)
- Frostbite risk (exposed skin in minutes)
- Hypothermia risk (wet = death)
- Cabin fever (isolation, mental health)

**Priorities:**
- **FIRE MAINTENANCE:** 24/7 heat source (life or death)
- Firewood consumption (1/2 to 1 cord per month)
- Water access (ice holes, melting snow)
- Food rationing (stretch fall harvest)
- Ice fishing (critical protein source)
- Mental health (boredom, isolation)
- **NEVER travel in blizzard** (whiteout = disorientation = death)

**Daily Routine (Winter):**
```
Dawn: Stoke fire, melt snow for water, eat breakfast
Morning: Check ice fishing tip-ups, collect firewood
Midday: Meal, fire maintenance, equipment repair
Afternoon: Ice fishing, hunting (if clear), firewood
Evening: Banking fire, meal, early sleep (long nights)
```

**Survival Rules:**
- Stay dry (wet = hypothermia)
- Keep fire going (losing fire in -20°F = potential death)
- Ration food (spring is 3-4 months away)
- Don't overexert (sweating = wet = hypothermia)
- Monitor weather (blizzard = shelter in place)
