summary: Different plant toxins produce distinct symptom patterns. Recognizing which toxin class is involved guides treatment and urgency. This is critical knowledge when someone has eaten an unknown plant.
warnings:
- Plant poisoning can be FATAL — water hemlock, death camas, castor bean, and rosary pea can kill within hours
- Children are at highest risk — smaller body mass means smaller lethal doses
- Activated charcoal (if available) should be given within 1 hour of ingestion for most plant poisons — 1g per kg body weight mixed in water
- Do NOT induce vomiting if the person is unconscious, seizing, or if a corrosive plant was eaten
- Bring a sample of the plant (or photo) for identification — treatment depends on the specific toxin
steps:
- 'ALKALOID POISONING (nightshade, jimsonweed, hemlock): Dilated pupils, dry mouth, flushed skin, rapid heartbeat, hallucinations, confusion, seizures. Treatment: keep patient cool, prevent self-injury
  during hallucinations, activated charcoal if within 1 hour.'
- 'CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES (foxglove, oleander, lily-of-the-valley): Nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances (yellow/green halos around lights), slow irregular heartbeat, confusion. LIFE-THREATENING — cardiac
  arrest possible. Treatment: activated charcoal, keep patient still, monitor pulse constantly.'
- 'OXALATE CRYSTALS (rhubarb leaves, dieffenbachia, philodendron): Immediate intense burning/swelling of mouth and throat, difficulty swallowing, drooling. Kidney damage possible with large doses. Treatment:
  rinse mouth with cold water/milk, cold compresses on swollen areas.'
- 'CYANOGENIC GLYCOSIDES (cherry pits, apple seeds, elderberry leaves/stems, cassava): Bitter almond taste, headache, dizziness, rapid breathing, then confusion, seizures, respiratory failure. Cherry-red
  skin color is a late sign. Treatment: remove from stomach if recent, fresh air, rescue breathing if needed.'
- 'GASTROINTESTINAL IRRITANTS (pokeweed, iris, daffodil bulbs): Intense nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea within 30 minutes to 2 hours. Usually self-limiting but dehydration is the main danger.
  Treatment: ORS (oral rehydration solution), rest, do NOT try to stop vomiting — the body is expelling the toxin.'
- 'HEPATOTOXINS (death cap mushroom, certain plants): Delayed onset 6-24 hours. Initial GI symptoms, then FALSE RECOVERY (feel better for 24-48 hours), then liver failure (jaundice, confusion, bleeding).
  This pattern is extremely dangerous — the false recovery kills by delaying treatment. Treatment: EMERGENCY — this requires IV fluids and hospital care. In the field, maintain hydration and prepare for
  evacuation.'
- 'NEUROTOXINS (water hemlock, poison hemlock): Seizures within 15-90 minutes of ingestion. Salivation, tremors, then violent seizures, respiratory failure. Water hemlock is the most violently toxic plant
  in North America. Treatment: protect airway during seizures, rescue breathing, there is no field antidote.'
- 'DERMATITIS PLANTS (poison ivy/oak/sumac, giant hogweed): Skin contact causes delayed rash (12-72 hours). Blistering, intense itching. Giant hogweed causes phototoxic BURNS — severe blistering when skin
  is exposed to sunlight after contact. Treatment: wash skin with cold water and soap within 30 minutes, cool compresses, hydrocortisone cream.'
- 'GENERAL TREATMENT PRIORITIES: (1) Airway — keep it open. (2) Breathing — rescue breathe if needed. (3) Activated charcoal within 1 hour if available. (4) Maintain hydration with ORS. (5) Keep patient
  calm and still. (6) Document time of ingestion, amount eaten, and symptoms for medical handoff.'
- 'PREVENTION: learn to identify the 10 most dangerous plants in your region. Avoid: white/yellow berries, umbrella-shaped flower clusters, plants with milky sap (except dandelion/milkweed), three-leaf
  patterns near ground level, anything with an almond scent when crushed.'
