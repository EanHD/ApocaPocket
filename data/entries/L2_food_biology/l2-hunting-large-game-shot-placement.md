# Large Game Shot Placement - Ethical Kills

**🎯 GOAL**: One shot, instant death, no suffering, no tracking, no wounded animal escaping.

**ETHICS**: If you shoot, you owe the animal a quick, clean death. Poor shot placement = prolonged suffering.

---

## Why Shot Placement Matters

**Consequences of Poor Shots:**
1. **Animal suffering**: Hours or days of pain before death
2. **Lost game**: Wounded animal escapes, meat wasted
3. **Dangerous tracking**: Wounded animals can charge (moose, bear)
4. **Legal/ethical issues**: Wounding without recovery is illegal in most jurisdictions
5. **Personal trauma**: Witnessing prolonged animal death

**Goal Statistics:**
- **Instant kill**: Death within 10 seconds (heart/spine/brain shots)
- **Acceptable**: Death within 1-2 minutes, minimal tracking (<50 yards)
- **Poor**: Tracking >100 yards, prolonged suffering

---

## 🫀 Vital Organs & Kill Zones

### Priority Ranking (Instant Kill Likelihood)

**1. Heart/Lung Combo (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Location**: Behind front shoulder, lower 1/3 of body
- **Size**: 8-12 inch diameter circle (large target)
- **Result**: Massive blood loss, death in 10-30 seconds
- **Tracking**: 0-50 yards (usually drops within sight)
- **Shot angle**: Broadside (best) or quartering away

**2. Double Lung**
- **Location**: Behind shoulder, center chest cavity
- **Size**: 10-15 inch oval (larger target than heart alone)
- **Result**: Rapid oxygen loss, death in 30-60 seconds
- **Tracking**: 25-100 yards
- **Shot angle**: Broadside or slight quartering

**3. Spine (High Risk/High Reward)**
- **Location**: Directly above heart/lung line, centerline of back
- **Size**: 2-3 inches wide (small target)
- **Result**: Instant paralysis and death (if hit), no effect if missed by inches
- **Tracking**: Drops immediately or no effect
- **Shot angle**: Broadside only (clear spine shot)
- **Risk**: Easy to miss, may wound without killing

**4. Brain (Expert Only)**
- **Location**: Between eyes, slightly above eye line, 2-4 inches back from face
- **Size**: 3-5 inches (softball size)
- **Result**: Instant death (if hit), no effect if missed
- **Tracking**: Drops immediately or unharmed
- **Risk**: Small target, skull deflects some bullets, animal movement
- **Use**: Close range (<50 yards), finishing wounded animal

**5. Neck (Not Recommended)**
- **Location**: Center of neck, midway between head and chest
- **Size**: 4-6 inches (vertical target)
- **Result**: Severs spine or major arteries (instant death) OR wounds trachea/esophagus (slow death)
- **Risk**: High miss rate, unpredictable results
- **Avoid**: Use heart/lung shot instead

## 🦌 Species-Specific Anatomy

### Moose (*Alces alces*)

**Size**: 800-1200 lbs (bulls), 600-900 lbs (cows)  
**Vitals Location**: Large chest cavity, but set farther back than deer

**Shot Placement:**
- **Broadside**: Aim 1/3 up from chest bottom, center of shoulder blade (or just behind)
- **Quartering Away**: Aim for opposite shoulder (bullet travels diagonally through lungs)
- **Target Zone**: 12-15 inch diameter (large but aim small)

**Challenges:**
- Massive chest cavity (can absorb poorly placed shots)
- Heavy bone structure (use adequate caliber)
- May travel 50-100 yards even with perfect heart shot (momentum)

**Avoid**:
- Quartering toward (shoulder bone blocks vitals)
- Head-on (too much bone, no vital exposure)
- Rear shots (gut shot = slow, painful death)

### Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*)

**Size**: 200-400 lbs (bulls), 150-300 lbs (cows)  
**Vitals Location**: Similar to deer, but slightly larger chest cavity

**Shot Placement:**
- **Broadside**: Aim behind shoulder, lower 1/3 of body
- **Target Zone**: 8-10 inch diameter

**Challenges:**
- Often moving (migratory behavior)
- Wind affects bullet trajectory (open tundra)
- Herd dynamics (hit the right animal)

**Advantages:**
- Lighter bone structure (easier penetration)
- Typically drop quickly with good shot

### White-Tailed / Mule Deer (*Odocoileus* species)

**Size**: 100-250 lbs (bucks), 80-150 lbs (does)  
**Vitals Location**: Standard for reference (other game compared to deer)

**Shot Placement:**
- **Broadside**: Behind front leg, lower 1/3 of body
- **Target Zone**: 8 inch diameter

**Challenges:**
- Smaller target (less room for error)
- Often in brush (branches deflect bullets)
- Nervous, alert (sudden movement)

**Advantages:**
- Lighter animal (drops faster with good shot)
- Abundant (more practice opportunities)

## 📐 Shot Angles & Aiming Points

### Broadside (BEST)

**Animal Orientation**: 90° to shooter, side fully exposed

**Aiming Point:**
- Visualize vertical line behind front leg (shoulder blade)
- Aim 1/3 up from bottom of chest
- Center of "crease" behind shoulder

**Why Best:**
- Largest vital zone exposure
- No bones blocking vitals (if just behind shoulder)
- Clear view of animal's posture
- Easiest range estimation

**Shot Result**: Heart and/or both lungs, rapid death, short tracking

### Quartering Away (GOOD)

**Animal Orientation**: 45° angle, rear quarters toward shooter

**Aiming Point:**
- Aim for FAR SHOULDER (opposite side)
- Bullet travels diagonally through chest cavity
- Slightly farther back than broadside (to compensate for angle)

**Why Good:**
- Bullet path through vitals is long (slices through heart/lungs)
- Less likely to hit shoulder bone
- Animal often unaware (not looking at you)

**Shot Result**: Double lung, heart, rapid death

**Caution**: Don't shoot too far back (gut shot)

### Quartering Toward (POOR)

**Animal Orientation**: 45° angle, front quarters toward shooter

**Aiming Point:**
- Front of chest, where neck meets shoulder
- Aim to reach vitals behind opposite shoulder

**Why Poor:**
- Shoulder bone blocks bullet path
- Narrow vitals exposure
- Easy to miss vitals entirely (lung shot from front is shallow)

**Recommendation**: Wait for better angle or pass on shot

### Head-On (AVOID)

**Animal Orientation**: Facing shooter directly

**Why Avoid:**
- Thick chest/shoulder bones block vitals
- Difficult to hit heart/lungs from front
- High chance of gut shot (bullet travels length of body)
- Broken jaw or superficial wound (animal escapes)

**Exception**: Brain shot at very close range (<25 yards) if you're an expert

### Rear/Running Away (NEVER)

**Animal Orientation**: Rear toward shooter or moving away

**Why Never:**
- Gut shot (intestines, stomach) = slow, painful death
- No vital organs exposed
- Wounded animal may travel miles
- Illegal in most jurisdictions
- Unethical

**What to Do**: Let animal go, wait for better opportunity

## 🔫 Caliber & Bullet Selection

### Recommended Calibers by Species

| Species | Minimum Caliber | Ideal Caliber | Bullet Weight |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Moose** | .30-06 | .300 Win Mag, .338 Win Mag | 180-220 grains |
| **Caribou** | .243 Win | .270 Win, .30-06 | 130-180 grains |
| **Deer** | .243 Win | .270 Win, .308 Win | 130-165 grains |

### Bullet Types

**Soft Point / Expanding:**
- Mushrooms on impact (larger wound channel)
- Transfers energy to tissue (rapid death)
- Recommended for most hunting

**Full Metal Jacket (FMJ):**
- Passes through without expanding
- Less tissue damage (slower death)
- NOT recommended for hunting (use for target practice only)

**Bonded / Controlled Expansion:**
- Expands but retains weight (deep penetration)
- Good for heavy bone, large game
- Premium option (more expensive)

### Energy Requirements

**Minimum Kinetic Energy at Impact:**
- Moose: 2000 ft-lbs
- Caribou: 1200 ft-lbs
- Deer: 1000 ft-lbs

**Check Your Rifle**: Use ballistics calculator (online) to verify energy at your shooting distance

## 🎯 Range Considerations

### Ethical Shot Distances

| Skill Level | Max Range (Broadside) | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------|
| Beginner | 100 yards | Learn fundamentals first |
| Intermediate | 200 yards | Confident in rifle, conditions |
| Advanced | 300+ yards | Wind reading, ballistics knowledge |

**Factors Affecting Max Range:**
- Shooter skill (can you hit 6-inch circle at this range?)
- Rifle accuracy (sub-MOA preferred)
- Conditions (wind, rain, light)
- Shooting position (prone > sitting > kneeling > standing)
- Animal behavior (calm vs alert)

**Golden Rule**: If you're not confident you can hit a 6-inch circle at this range, don't take the shot.

### Zero Distance

**Recommended Zeros:**
- 200 yards: Good all-around (±3 inches from 50-250 yards)
- 100 yards: Short range hunting (thick brush)
- 300 yards: Long range (open tundra, mountains)

**Practice**: Zero rifle before hunting season, verify at range

## 🩸 Tracking & Recovery

### Blood Trail Reading

**Good Hit (Heart/Lung):**
- Bright red, frothy blood (lung shot) or dark red (heart shot)
- Heavy blood trail
- Animal runs 10-100 yards, leaves trail
- Found dead within short distance

**Poor Hit (Gut/Liver):**
- Dark, watery blood or stomach contents
- Sparse blood trail
- Animal may travel 0.5+ miles
- Found bedded down, still alive (dangerous)

**Muscle Hit (Non-Vital):**
- Dark red blood, small amounts
- Long trail (animal may survive)
- Difficult recovery

### Tracking Protocol

**Immediately After Shot:**
1. **Note where animal was standing** (mark with hat, flagging tape)
2. **Observe animal's reaction** (instant drop = good hit, running = assess)
3. **Wait 30-60 minutes** (don't push wounded animal, let it bed down)
4. **Mark blood trail** (flagging tape every 10-20 yards)
5. **Follow slowly, quietly** (don't spook animal if bedded)

**If Blood Trail Disappears:**
1. Mark last blood location
2. Search in expanding circles (10-20 yard radius)
3. Look for disturbed ground, broken branches
4. Check thick cover, water sources (animals seek shelter/water)

**If Animal Beds Down:**
- Approach from downwind (scent awareness)
- Have rifle ready (may need finishing shot)
- Be prepared for charge (moose can be dangerous when wounded)

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ Shooting Too Far
**Problem**: Overestimate skill, wind, or animal movement  
**Result**: Wounded animal, no recovery  
**Fix**: Know your limits, practice at range, pass on long shots

### ❌ Rushing the Shot
**Problem**: Animal about to leave, panic shot  
**Result**: Poor placement, gut shot  
**Fix**: Breathe, aim carefully, or let animal go

### ❌ Not Accounting for Angle
**Problem**: Shoot same spot on quartering animal as broadside  
**Result**: Miss vitals, hit guts or shoulder bone  
**Fix**: Visualize bullet path to far-side vitals

### ❌ Shooting at Moving Animal
**Problem**: Lead is off, bullet hits rear or front  
**Result**: Gut shot or miss  
**Fix**: Wait for animal to stop, or practice moving shots extensively

### ❌ Poor Follow-Up
**Problem**: Assume animal is dead, don't track, push too fast  
**Result**: Wounded animal escapes  
**Fix**: Always wait 30-60 min, track carefully, be patient

## 🛡️ Safety & Ethics

### Know Your Backdrop
- Never shoot unless you can see what's behind the animal
- Bullets travel 2+ miles (depending on caliber)
- Ricochets off rocks, water

### One Shot, One Kill Philosophy
- Take only shots you're 90%+ confident in
- Practice in off-season (100+ rounds minimum)
- Know your rifle's accuracy (shoot groups at range)

### Finishing Shots
- If animal is down but alive, approach carefully
- Shoot again (brain or heart) to end suffering
- Don't let animal struggle

### Respect the Animal
- Use all edible meat (don't waste)
- Quick, clean kill minimizes suffering
- Thank the animal (many indigenous traditions)

**Remember**: Ethical hunting means taking only shots you can make. An animal that dies 20 seconds after your shot, within sight, is success. An animal that suffers for hours or escapes wounded is failure — regardless of whether you "got" it.

**Practice. Be patient. Respect the animal.**
