summary: Wild geese (Canada goose, snow goose, etc.) are large waterfowl (6-14 lbs). Dark, rich meat similar to duck but larger. Plucking is extremely difficult - skinning or breasting recommended for field
  use.
warnings:
- Geese are tough to pluck - skinning is more practical
- Cook to 165F internal temp
- Some geese taste very gamey (grass-fed) - marinate to reduce strong flavor
- Geese migrate seasonally - availability varies by time and location
steps:
- 'FIELD DRESSING: Same as duck/turkey. Gut, rinse, optional plucking/skinning.'
- 'PLUCKING VS BREASTING: Full plucking takes hours. PRACTICAL: breast the bird (carve out breast meat, save legs/thighs, discard rest). Fast and yields most of the meat.'
- 'COOKING: (1) Roast whole (stuff, roast 2-3 hours at 325-350F). (2) Breast meat sliced and pan-seared. (3) Slow-cook tough cuts (legs/thighs) in stew. Dark, rich, fatty meat. Strong flavor.'
- 'PRESERVING: Geese are fatty - excellent for smoking or rendering fat (use for cooking). Smoked goose lasts weeks.'
- 'NUTRITION: High fat, high protein, calories. One goose provides substantial food (4-8 lbs meat).'
