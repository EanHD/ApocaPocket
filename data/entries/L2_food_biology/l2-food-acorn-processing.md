summary: 'Acorns from oak trees are one of the most abundant wild foods in temperate regions. High in carbs and fat. BUT raw acorns contain bitter tannins (toxic in large amounts). Must be leached before
  eating. Two methods: cold water leaching (days) or hot water leaching (hours).'
warnings:
- Raw acorns are NOT safe to eat - tannins cause digestive upset, nausea, kidney damage with repeated consumption
- All oak species produce edible acorns after leaching, but bitterness varies - white oaks are less bitter than red oaks
- Green or moldy acorns are inedible
- Leaching is time-consuming but essential
steps:
- 'HARVEST: Fall when acorns drop. Collect from ground. Discard any with holes (weevils), mold, or green color. Good acorns are brown, heavy, shiny. Yields: one mature oak produces 50-500 lbs of acorns
  per year (varies by species and mast year).'
- 'SHELLING: Crack shell with rock or nutcracker. Remove inner nut (kernel). Shells are not edible.'
- 'COLD WATER LEACHING (traditional, best flavor): (1) Crush or grind kernels coarsely. (2) Place in mesh bag or cloth. (3) Submerge in stream or bucket of water. Change water daily. (4) Taste after 3-5
  days - when no longer bitter, leaching is complete (7-14 days for red oak species). (5) Result: sweet, mild nut meal.'
- 'HOT WATER LEACHING (fast, 2-4 hours): (1) Crush kernels. (2) Boil in pot of water for 15 min. Water turns dark brown. (3) Drain, add fresh water, boil again. (4) Repeat 5-10 times until water stays clear
  and acorn tastes mild (no bitterness). (5) Result: less flavor but faster.'
- 'DRYING: Spread leached acorn meal on cloth or screen. Sun-dry or oven-dry (low temp) until completely dry. Store in airtight container.'
- 'USES: (1) Acorn flour - grind dried meal into flour, use in baking (pancakes, bread, cookies). Mix 25-50% acorn flour with wheat flour. (2) Acorn mush - cook leached meal with water into porridge. (3)
  Roasted acorns - coffee substitute. FLAVOR: Mild, nutty, slightly sweet when properly leached.'
- 'NUTRITION: High in carbs (60%), moderate fat (15%), some protein (6%). Good calorie source. Historically a staple carbohydrate for many indigenous peoples.'

# Acorn Processing — Leaching Tannins for Edibility

Acorns from oak trees are one of the most abundant wild foods in temperate regions. High in carbs and fat. BUT raw acorns contain bitter tannins (toxic in large amounts). Must be leached before eating. Two methods: cold water leaching (days) or hot water leaching (hours).
