## Key Plant Resources

### Edible Plants (by season)

| Plant | Season | Parts Used | Calories/lb | Preparation | Cross-ref |
|-------|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Cattail | Year-round | Roots, shoots, pollen | 800-1200 | Raw/cooked roots, pollen as flour | l1-cattail-guide.md |
| Oak acorns | Sep-Dec | Nuts | 2000+ | MUST leach tannins, roast | l1-oak-acorn-processing.md |
| Kudzu | May-Oct | Leaves, roots, flowers | 400-600 | Cook leaves, roots high starch | l2-invasive-edibles.md |
| Wild muscadine | Aug-Oct | Fruit | 300-400 | Eat raw, ferment juice | l1-wild-grapes.md |
| Palmetto | Year-round | Heart (terminal bud) | 200-300 | Raw/cooked, KILLS PLANT | l2-palm-harvesting.md |
| Sassafras | Year-round | Roots, leaves | Tea/flavoring | Root tea, file powder from leaves | l1-medicinal-plants.md |
| Pine (inner bark) | Winter | Cambium | 500-600 | Emergency food, peel outer bark | l1-survival-trees.md |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Kudzu is everywhere and edible, but introduced. High in starch. Leaves must be cooked. Roots require extensive processing.

### Toxic Look-alikes
- **Poison ivy:** "Leaves of three, let it be" - causes severe rash, airborne when burned
- **Water hemlock:** Resembles cattail shoots - DEADLY, causes seizures
- **Carolina jessamine:** Yellow flowers - DEADLY, affects respiratory system
- **Pokeweed:** Berries toxic unless properly prepared (multiple boilings)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Side-by-side comparison of cattail vs water hemlock, kudzu identification chart.

### Useful Non-food Plants
- **Spanish moss:** Insulation, bedding (MUST boil - mites/chiggers)
- **Pine resin:** Fire starter, adhesive, waterproofing
- **Palmetto fronds:** Thatching, basket weaving, rain protection
- **River cane:** Construction, fish traps, arrows
- **Sweetgum sap:** Chewing gum (harvest spring)

## Key Animal Resources

### Large Game

| Animal | Weight | Season | Habitat | Hunting Notes | Yield (lbs meat) |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| White-tailed deer | 100-200 lbs | Nov-Jan (varies by state) | Edge habitat, oak forests | Most abundant game | 40-80 |
| Wild hog (feral) | 100-400 lbs | Year-round (invasive) | Swamps, oak forests, crop edges | Aggressive when cornered, disease risk | 60-200 |
| Wild turkey | 10-25 lbs | Spring gobbler season | Open forests, fields | Excellent eating, challenging hunt | 8-15 |

**Feral Hogs:** Invasive, destructive, NO closed season in most states. Meat MUST be cooked to 160°F (trichinosis risk). Aggressive, especially sows with piglets.

### Fish & Aquatic

| Species | Avg Weight | Season | Habitat | Method | Notes |
|---------|------------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Catfish (channel, blue) | 5-30 lbs | Year-round | Rivers, lakes | Trotlines, juglines | Bottom feeders, strong fighters |
| Bass (largemouth) | 2-8 lbs | Spring-fall (best) | Lakes, ponds, slow rivers | Lures, live bait | Sport fish, good eating |
| Bream/Bluegill | 0.5-2 lbs | May-Sep (peak) | Ponds, slow water | Crickets, worms | Easy to catch, abundant |
| Freshwater shrimp | <1 oz | Summer | Streams, spring runs | Dip nets | Seasonal, delicious |
| Crawfish | 2-4 oz | Jan-May | Swamps, ditches, rice fields | Traps | Louisiana staple, mudbugs |

**Water Purification Critical:** All Southeast water sources carry risk of bacteria, parasites (Giardia), and pollution. ALWAYS purify.

### Small Game & Birds
- **Squirrel (gray, fox):** Abundant in oak/hickory forests, hunt Sep-Feb, 1-2 lbs meat each
- **Rabbit (cottontail, swamp):** Fields and edges, hunt Oct-Feb, 1-2 lbs meat
- **Dove (mourning):** Sep-Jan season, excellent eating, fast flight
- **Duck (wood, mallard):** Nov-Jan, wetlands, decoy hunting

### Dangerous Animals (see l2-regional-southeast-hazards.md)
- **American alligator:** 6-14 feet, ambush predators, avoid water edges dawn/dusk
- **Venomous snakes:** Cottonmouth, copperhead, rattlesnake (timber, diamondback, pygmy), coral snake
- **Wild hogs:** Can be aggressive, dangerous tusks, unpredictable
- **Fire ants:** Aggressive swarms, anaphylaxis risk, painful stings

## Water Sources & Purification

### Source Types
- **Rivers/streams:** Abundant year-round, fast-flowing sources safer than stagnant
- **Springs:** Excellent sources (still purify), common in limestone areas (Florida, Kentucky)
- **Swamps/bayous:** Last resort, high bacterial load, parasites, tannic acid (brown color)
- **Rain collection:** Reliable (45-65" annual), especially summer thunderstorms
- **Dew collection:** High humidity = significant dew, collect from grass/tarps at dawn

### Purification Priority
1. **Boil:** 1 minute rolling boil (3 minutes above 5000 ft, rare in Southeast)
2. **Filter + chemical:** 0.2-micron filter PLUS iodine/chlorine for viruses
3. **Chemical only (emergency):** Iodine tablets, 30-60 minutes wait time
4. **UV (if device available):** SteriPEN-type, requires clear water

**⚠️ Warm Water Risk:** Temperatures above 70°F increase bacteria/parasite growth. Brain-eating amoeba (Naegleria fowleri) in warm freshwater - avoid getting water in nose.

### Seasonal Water Strategies

| Season | Availability | Temperature | Concerns | Strategy |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Summer | Abundant | 70-85°F | Bacteria bloom, algae, low flow in drought | Prefer flowing water, boil minimum 1 min |
| Fall | Abundant | 60-75°F | Hurricane/flood contamination | Avoid floodwater (sewage, chemicals) |
| Winter | Abundant | 40-60°F | Rarely freezes (except mountains) | Best season for water safety |
| Spring | Very abundant | 55-70°F | Flooding, agricultural runoff | Filter turbid water first |

## Shelter Construction

### Climate-Specific Requirements
1. **Elevation:** 12-24" off ground (flooding, snakes, alligators, insects)
2. **Ventilation:** Cross-breeze essential (humidity, heat)
3. **Rain protection:** Steep roof pitch (heavy rain), waterproof covering
4. **Insulation:** Minimal in summer (airflow priority), moderate in winter
5. **Hurricane resistance:** Low profile, strong anchoring, avoid large trees (widow-makers)

### Shelter Types by Season

#### Summer Shelter (May-September)
```
Design: Open-sided lean-to or platform shelter
- Platform: 18-24" off ground, 6x8 ft minimum
- Roof: Palmetto fronds or tarp, 45° pitch, extends 2 ft beyond platform
- Sides: Open for airflow (mosquito netting critical)
- Floor: Breathable (gaps between poles/planks)
- Location: Hilltop or clearing (breeze), avoid low-lying areas (mosquitoes)
```

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Elevated platform shelter with cross-section showing airflow, palmetto thatch detail, elevated support construction.

#### Hurricane Shelter (June-November)
```
Design: Low-profile, reinforced structure
- Location: INLAND (20+ miles from coast), away from large trees
- Construction: Below ground preferred (basement, storm cellar)
- Above-ground: Small, central room, reinforced corners, no windows
- Anchoring: Deep stakes, guy lines in multiple directions
- Supplies: Water (1 gal/person/day x 7 days), food, first aid, radio
```

**⚠️ EVACUATION:** If hurricane Cat 3+ approaches, EVACUATE if possible. Coastal storm surge can reach 20+ feet inland.

#### Winter Shelter (December-February)
```
Design: Enclosed structure with moderate insulation
- Walls: Enclosed on 3-4 sides, windbreak on north
- Insulation: Spanish moss (boiled/dried), pine needles, leaves
- Heating: Small fire pit with chimney/vent (NEVER enclosed fire without ventilation)
- Floor: Still elevated (occasional winter flooding)
- Location: South-facing, protected from north winds
```

### Material Sources
- **Framework:** River cane, pine saplings (abundant), palmetto trunks
- **Roofing:** Palmetto fronds (best), pine boughs, oak leaves (thick layer), plastic tarp if available
- **Cordage:** Kudzu vines, inner bark strips, Spanish moss (dried/twisted)
- **Waterproofing:** Pine resin/pitch, mud daub

## Fire Making & Management

### Humid Environment Challenges
- **High humidity:** 60-90% makes tinder difficult to ignite
- **Damp wood:** Surface moisture on all deadwood
- **Rain frequency:** Summer thunderstorms almost daily

### Fire Starting Strategy

#### Tinder (driest materials)
1. **Pitch pine (fatwood):** Resin-rich heartwood from dead pine stumps - BEST option
2. **Pine needles (dry):** Collect from under low branches (protected from rain)
3. **Cattail fluff:** Seed heads, extremely flammable when dry
4. **Birch bark:** Rare in Southeast but excellent if found (mountains)
5. **Spanish moss (dried):** MUST be completely dry, burns fast

**Where to Find Dry Materials:**
- Under overhangs, inside hollow logs
- Standing dead trees (inside, protected from rain)
- Your own clothing/body (keep tinder dry there)

#### Kindling Progression
```
1. Tinder bundle: Pitch pine shavings + cattail fluff (fist-sized)
2. Pencil-thick: Small pine twigs, split kindling (feather sticks)
3. Finger-thick: Larger pine branches, split wood
4. Wrist-thick: Split logs (ALWAYS split - dries faster)
```

### Wood Selection (BTU & Burn Characteristics)

| Wood Type | BTU/cord | Burn Rate | Smoke | Coals | Best Use | Availability |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Oak (white, red) | 24-30M | Slow | Low | Excellent | Long-term heat, cooking | Abundant |
| Hickory | 28-30M | Slow | Low | Excellent | Cooking (flavor), heat | Common |
| Pine (any) | 15-20M | Fast | High | Poor | Quick heat, fire starting | Very abundant |
| Cypress | 18-22M | Moderate | Moderate | Good | Swamp areas, water-resistant | Swamps |
| Sweetgum | 20-24M | Moderate | Moderate | Good | General purpose | Common |

**Fire Rule:** Split all wood - even finger-thick pieces. Split wood dries 3-5x faster than rounds.

### Fire Lay Types

#### Quick Heat Fire (cooking, warmth)
```
"Tipi/Cone" arrangement:
- Tinder bundle in center
- Kindling leaned around center (cone shape)
- Burns hot and fast
- Good for: Boiling water, cooking meals
```

#### Long-Burn Fire (overnight, extended heat)
```
"Log cabin" or "upside-down fire":
- Largest logs on bottom (parallel)
- Progressively smaller layers (perpendicular each layer)
- Tinder/kindling on TOP
- Burns down slowly (4-8 hours)
- Good for: Overnight warmth, slow cooking
```

#### Wet Weather Fire
```
"Platform fire":
- Base layer of green logs (platform, keeps fire off wet ground)
- Fire built on top of platform
- Teepee of split wood around tinder
- Reflector wall behind (green logs, rock)
```

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Three fire lay illustrations (tipi, log cabin, platform), wood splitting technique, fatwood identification.

### Smoke Management
- **Pine creates heavy smoke:** Use hardwoods for low-smoke fires
- **Signaling:** Green pine boughs on hot fire = dense white smoke
- **Insect repellent:** Damp wood/moss creates smoke (mosquitoes)
