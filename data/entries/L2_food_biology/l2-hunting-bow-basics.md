# Bow Hunting Basics - Silent Survival Hunting

**🏹 ADVANTAGE**: Silence. No gunshot to alert other game, predators, or people. Reusable ammunition (arrows). Effective tool when firearms are unavailable or impractical.

**⚠️ REALITY CHECK**: Bow hunting is harder than rifle hunting. Shorter range, more practice required, longer tracking distances. But in survival, silence is golden.

## Why Bow Hunting in Survival?

**Advantages:**
1. **Silent**: Won't spook other animals or reveal your location
2. **Reusable ammo**: Arrows can be recovered and reused (or improvised)
3. **No ammunition resupply**: Don't need to find bullets
4. **Legal access**: Some areas allow bow hunting when firearms prohibited
5. **Stealth hunting**: Can hunt near camp without noise

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Short range**: 20-40 yards (vs 100-300 for rifles)
2. **More skill required**: Hundreds of practice shots needed
3. **Longer kill time**: Animals run farther after hit (30-100+ yards)
4. **Weather sensitive**: Wind, rain affect arrows dramatically
5. **Requires more physical strength**: Drawing 40-60 lb bow repeatedly

**Bottom Line**: Bow hunting is a skill to develop before you need it. Not something to learn when hungry.

## 🏹 Recurve vs. Compound Bows

### Recurve Bow (Traditional)

**Design**: Simple curved limbs, no pulleys or cams

**Advantages (Survival Context):**
- Fewer parts to break (durable)
- Can be field-repaired or improvised
- Lighter weight (easier to carry)
- No maintenance required (no cables, cams)
- Quiet (no mechanical noise)

**Disadvantages:**
- Harder to draw (full weight throughout draw)
- Less accurate at range (no let-off)
- Requires more strength and practice

**Draw Weight (Survival):**
- Deer/Caribou: 40-50 lbs minimum
- Moose: 50-60 lbs minimum
- Practice: 30-40 lbs (build strength, then increase)

**Cost**: $100-500 (quality survival recurve)

### Compound Bow (Modern)

**Design**: Pulley system (cams) provides mechanical advantage

**Advantages:**
- Let-off (60-80%): Easier to hold at full draw, better aim
- More accurate (consistent draw, sights, stabilizers)
- Higher arrow speeds (flatter trajectory)
- Less physical strength needed (for holding aim)

**Disadvantages (Survival):**
- Complex (cables, cams, strings can break)
- Difficult to repair in field (requires specialized tools/knowledge)
- Heavier (3-5 lbs)
- Requires tuning and maintenance
- Noisier (mechanical components)

**Draw Weight:** Same as recurve (40-60 lbs), but let-off makes holding easier

**Cost**: $300-1500+ (quality compound)

### Survival Recommendation

**Best for Wilderness Survival**: Recurve (simplicity, durability)  
**Best for Hunting Success**: Compound (accuracy, ease)  
**Best Compromise**: Take-down recurve (packs small, field-serviceable)

## 🎯 Arrow Selection

### Arrow Materials

**Carbon:**
- Lightweight, strong, consistent
- Expensive ($8-15 per arrow)
- Difficult to improvise
- Best for modern hunting

**Aluminum:**
- Durable, affordable
- Can bend (but can be straightened)
- Moderate weight
- Good middle-ground

**Wood (Traditional):**
- Improvised in survival (see below)
- Heavier, less consistent
- Requires tuning (spine matching)
- Authentic traditional archery

**Fiberglass:**
- Very durable, cheap ($3-5 per arrow)
- Heavy (slower flight)
- Good for practice, backup

### Arrow Spine (Stiffness)

**Why It Matters**: Too stiff or too flexible = arrow wobbles, flies inaccurately

**Spine Matching**: Must match bow draw weight and arrow length
- 40 lb bow → 500-600 spine (flexible)
- 50 lb bow → 400-500 spine
- 60 lb bow → 300-400 spine (stiff)

**Check manufacturer chart** (Easton, Gold Tip, etc.) for your specific bow

### Arrow Length

**Measure**: Full draw (arrow nock to bow grip) + 1-2 inches (safety margin)

**Typical Lengths:**
- 28-30 inches (average adult male)
- 26-28 inches (shorter draw, women, youth)

**Too Short = Dangerous**: Arrow can fall off rest or be drawn past bow

### Broadheads (Hunting Tips)

**Fixed Blade:**
- Razor-sharp blades (2-4 blades)
- Extremely durable, no moving parts
- Cuts large wound channel (heavy bleeding)
- Recommended for survival

**Mechanical (Expandable):**
- Blades deploy on impact
- Larger wound channel than fixed
- Can fail to deploy (wet, bone)
- Not recommended for survival (complexity)

**Weight**: 100-125 grains (standard for hunting arrows)

**Sharpness**: Must be razor-sharp (shave hair off your arm). Dull broadhead = poor penetration, wounded game.

## 🎯 Shot Placement (Bow-Specific)

### Differences from Rifle Hunting

**Shorter Range**: 20-40 yards (vs 100-300 for rifle)  
**Slower Kill**: Blood loss, not shock (takes longer)  
**Closer Vital Shots**: Must hit heart/lungs (spine/brain not practical)

### Recommended Shot Angles

**Broadside (BEST):**
- Aim: Directly behind front leg, lower 1/3 of body
- Target: Heart and both lungs (double lung)
- Result: Heavy blood loss, death in 30-90 seconds, 30-100 yard run

**Quartering Away (GOOD):**
- Aim: Toward opposite shoulder (diagonal through chest)
- Arrow slices through lungs lengthwise
- Avoid hitting far shoulder bone (stops arrow)

**Quartering Toward (AVOID):**
- Front shoulder blocks arrow
- Shallow penetration
- High chance of non-lethal hit

**Head-On or Rear (NEVER):**
- No vital exposure
- Gut shot = slow, painful death

### Aiming Points by Species

**Deer/Caribou:**
- Vital zone: 8-10 inches
- Aim for crease behind shoulder
- Distance: 15-30 yards (ideal)

**Moose:**
- Vital zone: 12-14 inches (larger target)
- Heavy bone structure (may stop arrow)
- Distance: 20-40 yards
- Use heavier arrows (500+ grains)

## 🩸 Tracking Bow-Shot Game

### Expect Longer Tracking

**Blood Loss (Not Shock)**: Arrow kills by hemorrhage, not energy transfer like rifle
- Death time: 30-90 seconds (vs 10-30 for rifle)
- Running distance: 50-150 yards (vs 10-50 for rifle)

### The Waiting Period

**After the Shot:**
1. **Note where animal was standing** (mark with arrow, hat)
2. **Observe animal's reaction**:
   - Hunched, tail down → Good hit (vitals)
   - Jumpy, tail up → Possibly missed or muscle hit
   - Slow walk → Excellent hit (will bed down soon)
3. **WAIT 30-60 MINUTES** (critical: don't push animal)
4. **Find arrow** (inspect for blood, hair, smell)

**Arrow Evidence:**
- Bright red, frothy blood → Lung hit (good)
- Dark red blood → Heart or liver (good)
- Clear/smelly → Gut hit (bad, wait 4-6 hours before tracking)
- Greenish → Stomach (bad, wait longer)

### Following the Blood Trail

**Techniques:**
1. Start at last known location (where animal was shot)
2. Mark blood spots with flagging tape (every 10 feet)
3. Look ahead for next spot (don't trample trail)
4. Search for disturbed leaves, broken branches
5. Blood often on vegetation (waist-high, from wound)

**If Trail Goes Cold:**
- Circle search (20-30 yard radius from last blood)
- Look for beds (animal may have laid down)
- Check water sources (wounded animals seek water)

### Recovery Distance by Hit Quality

| Hit Type | Blood Trail | Distance | Recovery Time |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Double lung | Heavy, bright red, frothy | 30-80 yards | 30-60 min |
| Heart | Heavy, dark red | 40-100 yards | 30-60 min |
| Single lung | Moderate, bright red | 100-200 yards | 60-120 min |
| Liver | Dark, thin | 150-300 yards | 2-4 hours |
| Gut | Sparse, watery | 200+ yards | 6-12 hours |

## 🛠️ Improvised Arrows (Survival)

### Materials Needed

**Shaft**:
- Cane, bamboo, willow shoots (1/4 to 3/8 inch diameter)
- Straight growth (search creek banks, thickets)
- Dry thoroughly (green wood bends, wet wood rots)
- Length: 26-30 inches

**Point (Arrowhead)**:
- Flint, obsidian, glass (knapped to sharp point)
- Bone shard (sharpened)
- Hardened wood (fire-hardened tip)
- Metal scrap (filed to point)

**Fletching (Feathers)**:
- Bird feathers (goose, turkey, crow)
- Split down middle (create two fletchings per feather)
- Attach 3 feathers, evenly spaced (120° apart)
- Use pitch, glue, or sinew to bind

**Nock (Rear notch)**:
- Cut shallow groove (1/4 inch deep) at rear of shaft
- Notch should fit bowstring snugly

### Construction Steps

**1. Shaft Preparation (1-2 hours):**
- Cut straight shoots (look for consistent diameter)
- Remove bark, dry over fire (not in flames)
- Straighten by heating and bending (carefully)
- Sand smooth (or scrape with knife)

**2. Point Attachment (30-60 min):**
- Split shaft tip (1 inch deep)
- Insert stone/glass point
- Wrap split with sinew or cordage (tight)
- Seal with pitch or glue (pine resin, hide glue)

**3. Fletching (30 min per arrow):**
- Split feathers (central shaft exposed)
- Attach 3 fletchings (120° spacing)
- Bind with sinew at front and rear
- Optional: glue with pitch

**4. Nock Cutting (5 min):**
- Cut shallow notch (perpendicular to fletching)
- Test fit on bowstring (snug but not too tight)

**Yield**: 3-5 usable arrows per day (with materials on hand)

**Quality**: Improvised arrows are 50-70% as effective as modern arrows (less consistent, heavier, slower)

## 🌲 Primitive Arrow Materials by Region

### Alaska / Northern Wilderness

**Shafts:**
- Willow shoots (common, near water)
- Young spruce saplings (less ideal, resinous)
- Imported bamboo (if you brought it)

**Points:**
- Obsidian (volcanic glass, Interior Alaska)
- Bone (caribou leg bone, moose rib)
- Stone (flaked slate, quartzite)

**Fletching:**
- Raven, crow, grouse feathers
- Ptarmigan (smaller, but available)

**Binding:**
- Spruce root (split thin, soaked, wrapped)
- Sinew (leg tendons, back strap)
- Animal hide glue (boiled hooves, hide scraps)

---

## 🔧 Bow Maintenance (Survival)

### String Replacement

**Lifespan**: Bowstring lasts 500-2000 shots (or 1-2 years)

**Field Replacement:**
- Carry spare string (essential survival gear)
- Use Dacron or Fast Flight material (pre-made loop at each end)
- Measure: Bow length (tip to tip) minus 3-4 inches
- Wax string regularly (beeswax, paraffin)

**Improvised String**:
- Sinew (twisted, braided)
- Plant fiber cordage (dogbane, nettle, milkweed)
- Rawhide strips (thin, twisted)
- **Warning**: Improvised strings are weak (25-35 lb max draw weight)

### Bow Storage

**Unstring when not in use** (prevents limb fatigue, especially recurve)

**Store in cool, dry place** (avoid heat, moisture)

**Check for cracks** (limbs, riser) before each use

---

## 🎯 Practice Drills

### Building Proficiency

**Beginner** (0-100 shots):
- 10 yards, large target (18-inch circle)
- Focus on form (stance, draw, release, follow-through)
- Goal: Consistency, not accuracy

**Intermediate** (100-1000 shots):
- 15-20 yards, medium target (12-inch circle)
- Introduce aiming techniques (instinctive or gap shooting)
- Goal: 6/10 arrows in target

**Advanced** (1000+ shots):
- 20-30 yards, small target (8-inch circle)
- Shoot from different positions (kneeling, sitting, uphill/downhill)
- Goal: 8/10 arrows in target, hunting-ready

### Hunting-Specific Practice

**Shot from Tree Stand** (elevated angle, downward)  
**Shot While Kneeling** (low profile, common hunting position)  
**Shooting Uphill/Downhill** (aim low, gravity affects arrow)  
**Quick Draw** (animal appears suddenly, 5-second window)

**Rule**: Don't hunt until you can hit an 8-inch target at 20 yards, 8 out of 10 times.

- [ ] Rangefinder or range estimation practice
- [ ] Game bags (for meat transport)

**Skills:**
- [ ] Can hit 8-inch target at 20 yards (80% success)
- [ ] Know shot placement (heart/lungs)
- [ ] Practiced shooting from hunting position

**Mental:**
- [ ] Patient (won't rush shot)
- [ ] Will wait 30-60 min before tracking
- [ ] Will pass on poor shots

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

### Dry-Firing (NEVER)
- Releasing bowstring without arrow loaded
- Result: Bow explodes (limbs shatter), serious injury

### Arrow Inspection
- Check for cracks (carbon arrows can splinter, impale hand)
- Flex arrow gently (listen for cracking sound)
- Discard damaged arrows

### Backstop
- Always know what's beyond your target
- Arrows travel 200+ yards (if you miss)

### Draw Weight Limits
- Don't overdraw (pulling past full draw = bow breaks)
- Don't use bow above your strength (causes bad form, injury)

**Final Thought**: Bow hunting is not for everyone, and it's not for every situation. But in a long-term survival scenario, the ability to hunt silently and resupply your own ammunition is invaluable. 

**Practice before you're hungry. Hunt with patience. Track with diligence.**

The bow is an ancient tool. Respect it, master it, and it will feed you.
