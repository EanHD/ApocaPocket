## 1. ALTITUDE SICKNESS - The Silent Killer

### Why Altitude Kills

**Atmospheric Pressure Decreases with Elevation:**
| Elevation | Oxygen Available (vs Sea Level) | Breathing Rate Increase |
|-----------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Sea level | 100% | Baseline |
| 5,000 ft | 83% | +10-15% |
| 8,000 ft | 75% | +20-30% |
| 10,000 ft | 69% | +40-50% |
| 12,000 ft | 63% | +60-80% |
| 14,000 ft | 60% | +100%+ |

**At 14,000 ft:** You're breathing TWICE as fast to get same oxygen as sea level, but still only getting 60%.

---

### Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) - Common

**Onset:** 6-24 hours after rapid ascent above 8,000 ft

**Symptoms:**
- **Headache** (universal symptom, throbbing, worse at night)
- Nausea, loss of appetite
- Fatigue, weakness
- Dizziness, light-headedness
- Difficulty sleeping
- Shortness of breath (even at rest)

**Who Gets It:**
- 25% of people at 8,000 ft
- 50% of people at 10,000 ft
- 75%+ of people at 14,000 ft (if rapid ascent)
- **Physical fitness DOES NOT PREVENT IT** (Elite athletes get AMS too)

**Treatment:**
1. **STOP ascending** (do NOT go higher)
2. Rest at current elevation (acclimatize)
3. Hydrate (1+ gallon water per day)
4. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen (headache)
5. Light activity OK (but no strenuous exertion)
6. **If symptoms worsen:** DESCEND IMMEDIATELY (even 1,000-2,000 ft helps)

**Timeline:** Symptoms peak 24-48 hours, then improve (if you don't go higher)

**⚠️ If AMS symptoms WORSEN despite 24 hours rest:** Descend immediately (may be progressing to HAPE/HACE)

---

### High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) - FATAL

**What It Is:** Fluid accumulates in lungs (drowning in your own fluids)

**Onset:** 24-96 hours after rapid ascent above 8,000 ft

**Incidence:** 0.1-2% of people above 10,000 ft (but 10% in some populations at extreme altitude)

**Early Symptoms:**
- Worsening shortness of breath (worse than expected for altitude)
- Dry cough (progresses to wet, gurgling)
- Extreme fatigue (can't keep up with group)
- Chest tightness
- Rapid heart rate (even at rest)

**Advanced Symptoms:**
- Pink/bloody frothy sputum when coughing
- Blue lips, nails (cyanosis)
- Gurgling sound in chest (fluid moving)
- Can't walk 100 ft without stopping
- Can't lie flat (must sit up to breathe)
- Confusion (lack of oxygen to brain)

**Treatment:**
1. **DESCEND IMMEDIATELY** (1,000-3,000 ft minimum, more is better)
   - **ONLY treatment that works reliably**
   - Symptoms improve DURING descent
   - Descent = life-saving (waiting = death)
2. Supplemental oxygen if available (4-6 L/min)
3. Hyperbaric bag (Gamow bag) if available, no other option (simulates descent)
4. Medications (if available, but NOT substitute for descent):
   - Nifedipine 30mg extended-release (reduces pulmonary pressure)
   - Dexamethasone 8mg initial, then 4mg every 6 hours

**Timeline to Death:** 6-12 hours from advanced symptoms if no descent

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** HAPE can be FATAL in <12 hours. Descent is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

---

### High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) - FATAL

**What It Is:** Brain swells inside skull (increased intracranial pressure)

**Onset:** 24-96 hours after rapid ascent, often follows untreated AMS

**Incidence:** 0.1-1% above 10,000 ft (rarer than HAPE but MORE deadly)

**Symptoms:**
- **Severe headache** (unrelieved by medication)
- **Ataxia (loss of coordination):**
  - Can't walk straight line heel-to-toe
  - Stumbling, falling
  - Can't touch finger to nose
- Confusion, disorientation (what day is it, where am I)
- Altered mental status (irrational behavior, combative)
- Vomiting
- Seizures (late sign)
- Coma (terminal)

**Ataxia Test (CRITICAL):**
```
1. Draw straight line on ground (3 feet)
2. Person walks heel-to-toe along line
3. IF they step off line or wobble: HACE until proven otherwise
4. DESCEND IMMEDIATELY
```

**Treatment:**
1. **DESCEND IMMEDIATELY** (even at night, even in storm - HACE = imminent death)
   - Carry person if necessary (can't walk themselves)
   - Descent must be RAPID (every minute counts)
2. Dexamethasone 8mg initial, then 4mg every 6 hours (if available)
3. Supplemental oxygen (if available)
4. Hyperbaric bag (if no other option)

**Timeline to Death:** 12-24 hours from symptom onset if no descent (can be faster)

**⚠️ HACE = MEDICAL EMERGENCY. Descend or die.**

---

### Prevention of Altitude Sickness

**Acclimatization Rules:**
1. **"Climb high, sleep low":** Day trips to higher elevation OK, but sleep lower
2. **Ascent rate above 8,000 ft:**
   - Increase sleeping elevation by MAX 1,000-1,500 ft per day
   - Rest day every 3,000 ft gain (sleep at same elevation 2 nights)
3. **Hydration:** 1+ gallon water per day (altitude = dehydration)
4. **Avoid alcohol:** Depresses respiration (worsens altitude effects)
5. **Carb-heavy diet:** Easier to metabolize at altitude
6. **Recognize symptoms:** Early AMS = stop ascending

**Medication (Preventive, if available):**
- **Acetazolamide (Diamox):** 125-250mg twice daily
  - Starts 24 hours before ascent
  - Speeds acclimatization (makes you pee, increases breathing rate)
  - Side effects: Tingling fingers/toes, frequent urination, carbonation tastes flat

**Reality Check:**
- If you live at sea level, ascending to 10,000 ft+ in ONE day = high AMS risk
- Driving to 14,000 ft trailhead and hiking higher = asking for trouble
- Acclimatize at 8,000-10,000 ft for 2-3 days before going higher

## 2. AVALANCHES - The White Death

### Avalanche Facts
- **25-30 deaths per year in US** (90% in Rockies)
- **90% of avalanches triggered by victim** or someone in their party
- **Survival decreases rapidly:** 93% if dug out in 15 minutes, 30% at 35 minutes, <3% at 130 minutes
- **Season:** October-June (peak: December-March)

---

### Avalanche Terrain (Where They Happen)

**Slope Angle (Critical Factor):**
- **0-25°:** Too gentle (snow doesn't slide)
- **25-30°:** Occasional slides (wet avalanches)
- **30-45°:** DANGER ZONE (most avalanches occur here)
- **45-60°:** Very dangerous (frequent slides, hard to stand on)
- **60°+:** Too steep (snow doesn't accumulate much)

**Aspect (Which Direction Slope Faces):**
- **Lee slopes (downwind):** Most dangerous (wind-loaded snow, cornices)
- **North-facing:** Hold snow longer (don't consolidate, stay unstable)
- **South-facing:** Melt-freeze cycles (can be unstable, especially spring)
- **East/West:** Variable

**Terrain Features (Red Flags):**
- **Convex slopes:** Tension cracks (avalanche likely)
- **Cornices:** Overhanging snow on ridges (can collapse, trigger avalanche below)
- **Gullies/chutes:** Funnel avalanches (high consequence)
- **Sparse trees:** Avalanches clear trees (if no big trees, avalanches common)
- **Recent avalanche paths:** Will avalanche again (identifiable by lack of mature trees)

---

### Avalanche Types

#### Slab Avalanche (Most Deadly, 90% of Deaths)
**What It Is:** Cohesive slab of snow breaks loose as a unit

**Characteristics:**
- **Fracture line** (clean break across slope, 1-6+ feet deep)
- Entire slab slides at once (1-100+ acres)
- Speed: 60-80 mph (faster than you can run, ski, or snowmobile)
- Volume: Hundreds to millions of cubic feet
- **Buries victims deep** (3-8 feet)

**Triggers:**
- **New snow:** 12+ inches in 24 hours (high danger)
- **Wind loading:** Wind deposits snow on lee slopes (heavy, unstable)
- **Rapid warming:** Weakens bonds in snowpack
- **Human weight:** Skier, snowboarder, climber (trigger own avalanche)

#### Loose Snow Avalanche ("Sluff")
**What It Is:** Loose surface snow slides (looks like river of snow)

**Characteristics:**
- Starts at point, fans out downhill (triangle shape)
- Surface layer only (6 inches to 2 feet deep)
- Slower (20-40 mph)
- Less dangerous (but can knock you down slope into terrain trap)

---

### Snowpack Stability Factors

**Red Flag Conditions (High Avalanche Danger):**
1. **Heavy snowfall:** 12+ inches in 24 hours, 24+ inches in 48 hours
2. **Wind:** Loading lee slopes (wind speed 15+ mph during/after storm)
3. **Rapid warming:** Temperature rise 20°F+ (weakens bonds)
4. **Rain on snow:** Adds weight, reduces stability
5. **Recent avalanche activity:** If it's sliding, more will slide
6. **Whumpfing sounds:** Hollow collapse sound when walking (unstable layers)
7. **Shooting cracks:** Cracks radiate from your feet (slab ready to slide)

**Safe(r) Conditions:**
- Cold, stable weather (no new snow, no wind)
- Consolidated snowpack (bonded layers)
- Low-angle terrain (<25°)
- Dense forest (anchor snow, catch smaller slides)

---

### Avalanche Survival Protocol

#### Before Entering Avalanche Terrain

**Required Equipment (Rescue Trinity):**
1. **Avalanche transceiver (beacon):**
   - Transmits signal if buried (other rescuers locate you)
   - Everyone carries, everyone knows how to use
   - TEST before every outing
2. **Probe (collapsible pole):**
   - 10-12 feet long
   - Pinpoint buried victim after beacon search
3. **Shovel:**
   - Metal blade, extendable handle
   - Dig out victim (must be fast)

**Group Protocol:**
- One person crosses avalanche terrain at a time (others watch)
- Identify escape routes BEFORE crossing
- Loosen pack straps (jettison if caught)
- Remove ski pole straps (don't want to be anchored)

#### If Caught in Avalanche

**First 5 Seconds (FIGHT):**
1. **Yell:** Alert others you're caught
2. **Jettison equipment:** Pack, skis, poles (anything that can anchor you)
3. **Swim/fight:** "Swimming" motions upward and toward edge of avalanche
4. **Try to escape sideways:** Exit at 45° angle

**Middle (10-30 seconds):**
- Keep fighting (stay on surface if possible)
- Protect airways (cover mouth/nose with arm, create air pocket)
- If going under: Fight toward surface until avalanche slows

**Last Seconds (Avalanche Stopping):**
- **CRITICAL:** Create air pocket in front of face
  - Cup hands over mouth/nose
  - Try to expand chest (avalanche debris sets like concrete)
- Thrust one arm toward surface (rescue signal)

#### If Buried

- **DON'T PANIC** (uses oxygen faster)
- Conserve oxygen (breathe slowly, don't yell - no one can hear you)
- Try to expand chest space (avalanche debris compresses you)
- **Survive on air pocket:** 15-30 minutes (deeper burial = less air)
- **Hope:** Your group has transceivers and starts searching immediately

---

### Companion Rescue (If Someone Else Buried)

**Timeline:** 15 minutes = 93% survival, 35 minutes = 30% survival

**Steps:**
1. **Mark last-seen point:** Where victim disappeared (start search there)
2. **Visual search:** Look for clues (gear, body parts, clothing) - 30 seconds
3. **Turn beacon to RECEIVE:** All survivors switch to search mode
4. **Follow beacon:** Closest signal = direction to victim
5. **Bracket search:** Get within 1-2 feet of victim
6. **Probe:** Pinpoint exact location (probe every 12 inches)
7. **Dig FAST:**
   - Dig from downhill side (easier)
   - Clear airway FIRST (face)
   - Then fully extract
8. **First aid:** Check breathing, pulse, CPR if needed, treat hypothermia

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Go for help first (victim will be dead when you return)
- ❌ Give up (people have survived 3+ hours buried)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Slope angle danger zones (25-45° highlighted), avalanche burial survival timeline, beacon search pattern.

## 3. LIGHTNING - Daily Threat

### Rockies = Lightning Capital of US
- **Afternoon thunderstorms DAILY:** June-August
- **Predictable:** Morning clear, clouds build 11 AM-12 PM, storm 2-4 PM, clear by evening
- **Above treeline = lightning rod:** You are tallest object

---

### Lightning Strike Statistics
- **20-30 deaths per year in US** (mountains = high risk)
- **Strike distance:** 10-15 miles from storm center (can strike from "blue sky")
- **Speed:** 1/3 speed of light (no time to react once you see it)
- **Temperature:** 50,000°F (5x hotter than sun surface)

---

### High-Risk Locations (Avoid in Storm)

**Death Traps:**
1. **Summits, ridges, peaks:** Highest point = first strike target
2. **Isolated tall trees:** Lightning rod (30+ ft radius danger)
3. **Open fields/meadows:** You are tallest object
4. **Cave entrances (shallow):** Ground current funnels through
5. **Metal objects:** Fences, climbing gear (conductors)
6. **Water:** Lakes, streams (conducts electricity)

**Safer Locations:**
1. **Dense forest (away from tallest trees):** Forest interior, uniform tree height
2. **Valley bottom (NOT flood zone):** Low, protected
3. **Boulder fields:** Crouch between boulders (not on, not touching)
4. **Vehicle (enclosed metal):** Rubber tires don't protect, metal cage does

---

### Lightning Safety Protocol

#### Before Storm (Morning Ascent)

**Timing Strategy:**
- **Start early:** Dawn departure (summit by noon)
- **Turnaround time:** Be OFF summit/ridge by 2 PM (latest)
- **Descend early:** Don't wait for storm (it's coming)

**Watch for Signs:**
- **Towering cumulus clouds:** Building afternoon thunderhead
- **Darkening sky:** Even if distant (storms move fast)
- **Wind increase:** Outflow from approaching storm
- **Temperature drop:** 10-15°F in minutes (storm front)
- **Hair standing up:** IMMEDIATE danger (charge building)

#### During Storm (If Caught)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (if hair stands up, buzzing sounds):**
1. **Get off summit/ridge IMMEDIATELY** (even if mid-ascent, descend NOW)
2. **Drop metal objects:** Backpack frame, trekking poles, ice axe (20+ feet away)
3. **Assume lightning position:**
   - Crouch on balls of feet (minimize ground contact)
   - Feet together (reduces stride potential)
   - Hands over ears (protect from thunder shockwave)
   - Head down
4. **Spread out:** If in group, 50+ feet apart (one strike doesn't hit everyone)
5. **Avoid touching others:** Don't hold hands (conducts electricity)

**WAIT:**
- 30 minutes after last thunder/lightning before resuming
- Storm cells come in waves (wait for full clear)

#### If Someone Struck

**IMMEDIATE:**
- **SAFE TO TOUCH** (they don't hold electrical charge)
- Check pulse, breathing (lightning can stop heart)
- **CPR if needed:** Lightning victims often revive with CPR (heart stopped, not injured)
- Treat burns (entry/exit wounds)
- Treat shock, hypothermia
- **Evacuate:** Even if conscious, need medical evaluation (cardiac monitoring)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Afternoon storm timing chart, lightning position illustration, safe vs dangerous locations map.

## 4. GRIZZLY BEARS - Apex Predator

### Grizzly Bear Range (Rockies Only)
- **Montana:** Glacier National Park, Northern Continental Divide, Cabinet-Yaak
- **Wyoming:** Yellowstone, Grand Teton
- **Idaho:** Selkirk, Cabinet-Yaak, Yellowstone
- **Population:** 1,500-2,000 in lower 48 (all in these Rockies areas)

---

### Grizzly vs Black Bear (Critical Distinction)

| Feature | Grizzly Bear | Black Bear |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Size | 300-600 lbs (males), 200-400 lbs (females) | 150-350 lbs |
| Shoulder hump | YES (muscle mass, distinctive) | NO (straight back) |
| Face profile | Dish-shaped (concave) | Straight nose to forehead |
| Claws | 2-4 inches, light colored, visible | 1-2 inches, dark, curved |
| Behavior | AGGRESSIVE (stand ground or charge) | SHY (flee usually) |
| Climbing | Cubs can, adults don't (too heavy) | Excellent climbers (all ages) |
| Color | Brown, blonde, black (color NOT indicator) | Black, brown, cinnamon (color NOT indicator) |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Grizzlies in Rockies are AGGRESSIVE. Different response protocol than black bears.

---

### When Grizzlies are Dangerous

**1. Sow with Cubs (May-July):**
- EXTREMELY protective (will charge/attack)
- Give 300+ ft space (binoculars only)

**2. On a Kill (Carcass):**
- Defending food source (elk, deer carcass)
- Will charge if you approach (even unknowingly)
- **Signs:** Ravens circling, smell of decay, torn-up ground

**3. Surprised at Close Range (<100 ft):**
- Defensive charge/attack (protecting itself)
- Most common scenario for attacks

**4. Habituated Bears:**
- Lost fear of humans (campground bears, food-conditioned)
- Unpredictable, dangerous

---

### Grizzly Encounter Protocol

#### Prevention (CRITICAL)

**Make Noise:**
- Talk loudly, clap, "Hey bear!" every 1-2 minutes
- Especially: Near streams (water noise masks you), berry patches, dense brush
- **Group:** Hike in groups of 4+ (no recorded attacks on groups of 4+)

**Carry Bear Spray (MANDATORY in grizzly country):**
- 10+ oz canister (Counter Assault, UDAP)
- Hip holster (NOT in pack - need 2-3 second access)
- Practice drawing (muscle memory)
- Check expiration date

**Food Storage:**
- **Bear canisters:** Hard-sided, approved models (mandatory in many areas)
- **Never in tent:** Food, toiletries, scented items OUT
- Cook 100+ yards from camp
- Sleep 100+ yards from cooking area

#### If You See Grizzly (Distance >100 ft)

- **Stay calm, don't run**
- **Identify yourself:** "Hey bear, it's a human"
- **Wave arms slowly** (look big, human-like)
- **Back away slowly** (sideways, don't turn back)
- **Give it space:** Detour widely (300+ ft)
- **Don't approach:** Even for photos (people die doing this)

#### If Grizzly Charges (Most are Bluff Charges)

**Bluff Charge (Most Common):**
- Bear charges at high speed
- Stops or veers off at 10-30 feet
- May huff, pop jaw, slap ground after

**Response:**
1. **DO NOT RUN** (triggers chase, can't outrun - 35 mph)
2. **Stand your ground**
3. **Prepare bear spray:** Safety off, finger on trigger
4. **If bear within 30 feet:** SPRAY (aim at face, 2-second burst)
5. **If bear turns away:** It was a bluff (most are)

#### If Grizzly Contacts You (Attack)

**PLAY DEAD (For Defensive Attack):**
1. Lie flat on stomach OR curl in ball
2. Hands behind neck (protect head/neck)
3. Legs spread (harder to flip)
4. **Stay still and silent** (even if bear bites, claws - hard but necessary)
5. Bear usually leaves once threat neutralized (you're "dead")
6. **Wait 10+ minutes after bear leaves** (may be watching, return if you move)

**FIGHT BACK (Only if Predatory):**
- Signs: Bear stalking before attack, continues attacking despite playing dead (>1-2 min of biting)
- This is RARE (but happens)
- Use everything: Rocks, sticks, fists, kick
- Target eyes, nose
- Yell, scream
- **Don't give up**

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Grizzly vs black bear identification chart, bear spray effective range, encounter decision tree.

## 5. MOUNTAIN LIONS (Cougars, Pumas)

### Mountain Lion Profile
**Size:** 80-150 lbs (males), 60-100 lbs (females)  
**Range:** All Rockies  
**Behavior:** Solitary, ambush predators (stalk from behind)

---

### Mountain Lion Attack Profile
- **Attacks rare:** 20-30 attacks per decade in Rockies
- **Victims:** Often children, solo hikers, trail runners (appear as prey)
- **Method:** Stalking (from behind), leap onto back, bite neck/head

---

### Prevention
- **Hike in groups**
- **Keep children close** (don't let them run ahead)
- **Avoid dawn/dusk** (mountain lion hunting times)
- **Don't run on trails** (looks like prey fleeing)

### If You See Mountain Lion

**DO:**
1. **Stop, don't run** (triggers chase instinct)
2. **Face the lion** (don't turn back)
3. **Look big:**
   - Raise arms
   - Open jacket
   - Wave slowly
4. **Speak firmly, loudly:** "Go away, get out of here"
5. **Maintain eye contact** (shows you're not prey)
6. **Back away slowly** (don't turn around)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Run (lion can run 50 mph in burst)
- ❌ Crouch/bend down (looks like prey)
- ❌ Turn back (invites attack)

### If Mountain Lion Attacks

**FIGHT BACK AGGRESSIVELY:**
- Mountain lions are ambush predators (if attack fails, usually retreat)
- Use rocks, sticks, trekking poles, knife
- Target eyes, nose, face
- Punch, kick, gouge
- Yell, scream
- **Don't play dead** (different from grizzly - playing dead invites continued attack)
- Fight until lion retreats

**People have fought off mountain lions successfully** (unlike grizzly, you can win).
