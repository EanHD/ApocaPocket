- Wind chill: -50°F to -70°F (polar vortex events)
- Record lows: -60°F (Tower, Minnesota, 1996)
- Duration: 3-5 months of sustained freezing (Nov-Mar)

### Wind Chill Chart (Frostbite Timeline)

| Temperature | 5 mph wind | 15 mph wind | 25 mph wind | 35 mph wind |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 10°F | 7°F | -2°F | -6°F | -9°F |
| 0°F | -5°F | -16°F | -22°F | -26°F |
| -10°F | -16°F | -31°F | -39°F | -44°F |
| -20°F | -28°F | -45°F | -55°F | -61°F |
| -30°F | -39°F | -60°F | -72°F | -79°F |

**Frostbite Time-to-Injury:**
- **10-30 minutes:** Wind chill -15°F to -30°F
- **5-10 minutes:** Wind chill -30°F to -50°F
- **2-5 minutes:** Wind chill -50°F to -70°F
- **Under 2 minutes:** Wind chill below -70°F

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Exposed skin can freeze in UNDER 5 MINUTES in polar vortex conditions.

### Hypothermia Stages

#### Mild Hypothermia (95-90°F core temp)
**Symptoms:**
- Shivering (intense, uncontrollable)
- Cold hands/feet
- Minor confusion, sluggish thinking
- Loss of fine motor skills (fumbling with zippers, buttons)

**Action:**
1. Get to shelter IMMEDIATELY
2. Remove wet clothing
3. Dry clothing + insulation layers
4. Warm drinks (NO alcohol)
5. Light activity (generates heat, but don't sweat)

**Recovery:** 30-60 minutes with proper rewarming

#### Moderate Hypothermia (90-82°F core temp)
**Symptoms:**
- Shivering STOPS (body giving up)
- Severe confusion, slurred speech
- Loss of coordination (stumbling, falling)
- Drowsiness
- Paradoxical undressing (feels hot, removes clothes - FATAL sign)

**Action:**
1. **LIFE-THREATENING:** Immediate aggressive rewarming
2. Get to shelter
3. Remove wet clothes (cut off if necessary)
4. Wrap in sleeping bag, blankets
5. Hot water bottles/heated rocks to armpits, groin, neck (NOT directly on skin)
6. Warm drinks if conscious and coherent
7. Body-to-body heat (skin contact in sleeping bag)

**Recovery:** 1-4 hours, but brain damage risk

#### Severe Hypothermia (Below 82°F core temp)
**Symptoms:**
- Unconsciousness
- Weak/absent pulse
- Shallow/absent breathing
- Rigid muscles
- Appears dead

**Action:**
1. **DO NOT assume death** (people have survived core temps of 56°F)
2. Handle GENTLY (rough movement can cause cardiac arrest)
3. CPR if no pulse (but check for 60 seconds - pulse very slow)
4. Aggressive rewarming (warm water immersion if possible, 100-104°F)
5. "Not dead until warm and dead" (medical saying)

**Recovery:** Uncertain, medical emergency

### Frostbite

#### Frostbite Stages

**Frostnip (superficial, reversible):**
- White/pale skin
- Numbness
- No permanent damage if rewarmed gently
- Common on nose, cheeks, ears, fingers, toes

**Superficial Frostbite (1st-2nd degree):**
- White/gray-yellow skin
- Firm to touch but underlying tissue soft
- Blisters form in 24-48 hours (clear fluid)
- Pain when rewarming (good sign - nerves work)
- Recovery: 2-4 weeks, usually full recovery

**Deep Frostbite (3rd-4th degree):**
- Gray/blue/black skin
- Hard, frozen tissue (ice crystals in cells)
- No sensation (nerves frozen)
- Blisters (blood-filled) form in 24-48 hours
- Tissue death (gangrene) possible
- **May require amputation**
- Recovery: Months, often permanent damage

#### Frostbite First Aid

**DO:**
1. Get to warm shelter
2. Remove wet/constricting clothing (jewelry, boots)
3. Rewarm in warm water (98-105°F) for 20-30 minutes
4. Protect from refreezing (worse than staying frozen)
5. Give pain medication if available (rewarming is VERY painful)
6. Elevate affected area (reduces swelling)
7. Separate frozen fingers/toes with gauze

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Rub frozen tissue (causes more damage)
- ❌ Use direct heat (fire, stove - causes burns)
- ❌ Rewarm if chance of refreezing (causes worse damage)
- ❌ Pop blisters (infection risk)
- ❌ Walk on frozen feet if avoidable (more damage)

**"Frozen in, thawed out" rule:** If frostbitten and far from help, better to keep frozen and walk out, then thaw once. Refreezing causes catastrophic damage.

---

### Cold Exposure Prevention

#### Clothing System (Layering)

**Base Layer (next to skin):**
- Synthetic (polypropylene, polyester) OR merino wool
- Wicks moisture away from skin
- **NO COTTON** (cotton kills - holds moisture, loses all insulation when wet)

**Mid Layer (insulation):**
- Fleece, wool, synthetic puffy jacket
- Traps warm air
- Multiple thin layers > one thick layer (adjustability)

**Outer Layer (shell):**
- Windproof, water-resistant
- Breathable (lets sweat vapor escape)
- Sealed seams, good hood

**Extremities (most vulnerable):**
- **Head:** 30-40% of body heat lost through head (wear hat ALWAYS)
- **Hands:** Mittens > gloves (fingers warm each other), liner + shell system
- **Feet:** Wool socks (1-2 pairs), insulated boots, vapor barrier (plastic bag between sock layers prevents boot from getting wet from sweat)
- **Face:** Balaclava, face mask, goggles (prevent frostbite + snow blindness)

#### Activity Management
- **Avoid sweating:** Adjust layers before sweating starts
- **Rest frequently:** Don't overexert (sweating = death)
- **Eat high-calorie foods:** Body burns 2x-3x normal calories in cold
- **Stay hydrated:** Dehydration increases hypothermia risk (not intuitive)

#### Shelter Priorities
- **Windbreak:** Wind multiplies cold effect (see wind chill chart)
- **Insulation from ground:** More important than walls (ground sucks heat)
- **Heat source:** Fire or body heat (sleeping bag rated for temps)
- **Dry:** Any moisture = hypothermia accelerant

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Proper layering system diagram (base/mid/outer), frostbite progression photos/illustrations, wind chill calculator.

## 2. TORNADOES

### Midwest = Tornado Alley
**Annual Tornadoes:** 1000+ in region (50% of US total)  
**Peak Season:** April-May (70% of tornadoes)  
**Peak Time:** 3-9 PM (afternoon heating drives storms)  
**Most Violent:** EF4-EF5 tornadoes most common in Midwest

### Enhanced Fujita Scale (Damage-Based)

| Rating | Wind Speed | Damage Description | Survival Without Shelter | Frequency |
|--------|------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| EF0 | 65-85 mph | Branches broken, shallow-rooted trees pushed over | High | 53% |
| EF1 | 86-110 mph | Roof surfaces peeled, windows broken, mobile homes overturned | Moderate (injuries likely) | 31% |
| EF2 | 111-135 mph | Roofs torn off, mobile homes destroyed, large trees snapped | Low (serious injuries) | 11% |
| EF3 | 136-165 mph | Walls collapse, cars lifted, trains overturned | Very low (likely death/severe injury) | 4% |
| EF4 | 166-200 mph | Well-built homes leveled, cars thrown 100+ ft | Almost none (underground only) | 0.7% |
| EF5 | 200+ mph | Total obliteration, ground scouring, cars become missiles | None (deep underground only) | 0.1% |

**Historical Context:**
- **EF5 tornadoes in Midwest:** Joplin MO (2011, 161 dead), Moore OK (multiple), Plainfield IL (1990)
- **Tri-State Tornado (1925):** Deadliest US tornado, 695 deaths, 219-mile path across MO-IL-IN
- **Super Outbreak (2011):** 360 tornadoes in 3 days, 324 deaths

---

### Tornado Warning System

#### Watches vs Warnings

**Tornado Watch:**
- Conditions favorable for tornadoes
- Issued 4-8 hours in advance
- Cover large area (multiple counties/states)
- **Action:** Monitor weather, prepare shelter, have plan ready

**Tornado Warning:**
- Tornado detected on radar OR visually confirmed
- Issued for specific area (county or less)
- Average lead time: 13 minutes (can be as little as 0-2 minutes)
- **Action:** TAKE SHELTER IMMEDIATELY

**Tornado Emergency:**
- Rare, highest level
- Large, violent tornado confirmed, heading toward populated area
- Catastrophic damage imminent
- **Action:** TAKE SHELTER NOW, this is life-threatening

#### NOAA Weather Radio
- **CRITICAL in Midwest:** Battery/crank-powered radio
- Automatically activates for warnings (alarm tone)
- 24/7 coverage, works in basements
- Should be in every Midwest home/shelter

---

### Tornado Shelter Protocol

#### Best Shelter Locations (Ranked)

1. **Underground storm cellar/basement:**
   - Southwest corner (traditional, based on tornado approach direction)
   - Under heavy furniture/workbench (protection from collapsing floor above)
   - Away from windows

2. **Interior bathroom (ground floor):**
   - Small room (structure)
   - Plumbing adds support
   - Get in bathtub, cover with mattress

3. **Interior hallway/closet (ground floor):**
   - No windows
   - Center of building
   - Away from exterior walls
   - Crouch low, protect head/neck

4. **Ditch/ravine (if caught outside):**
   - Lie flat, face down
   - Hands over head/neck
   - NOT under highway overpass (wind tunnel effect, deadly)

#### What NOT to Do
- ❌ **Open windows** (myth - doesn't reduce damage, wastes critical seconds)
- ❌ **Stay in vehicle** (will be thrown/crushed)
- ❌ **Try to outrun** (tornadoes change direction, move at 30-70 mph)
- ❌ **Hide under highway overpass** (creates wind tunnel, debris trap)
- ❌ **Stay in mobile home** (even tied down, these are death traps in EF2+)

#### Position During Tornado
- **Crouch low:** Knees, head down (compact)
- **Protect head/neck:** Hands over head, helmet if available
- **Face away from windows:** Flying glass = shrapnel
- **Cover with mattress/cushions:** Protection from falling debris

---

### Tornado Survival in Wilderness

**If No Structure Available:**

1. **Find lowest ground:** Ditch, ravine, gully (NOT under trees)
2. **Lie flat, face down:** Make yourself smallest target
3. **Hands over head/neck:** Protect from flying debris
4. **DO NOT try to outrun:** Tornadoes are unpredictable, faster than you

**Tornado vs Vehicle:**
- **If tornado distant and you can drive perpendicular (90°):** Drive away
- **If tornado close:** ABANDON VEHICLE, lie in ditch
- **Never park under overpass:** Worst place (wind tunnel + concrete collapse)

**After Tornado:**
- Wait 1-2 minutes after winds stop (debris still falling)
- Watch for secondary tornadoes (often come in groups)
- Avoid downed power lines (assume all are live)
- Check for injuries (adrenaline masks pain)
- Be aware of gas leaks (smell, hissing)

## 3. BLIZZARDS & WHITEOUT

### Blizzard Definition (National Weather Service)
**ALL THREE conditions for 3+ hours:**
1. Sustained winds or gusts 35+ mph
2. Considerable falling or blowing snow
3. Visibility <1/4 mile

**Ground Blizzard:** Wind-driven snow (not falling), but same whiteout effect

### Blizzard Hazards

**Whiteout Conditions:**
- Zero visibility (can't see hand in front of face)
- Lose all sense of direction (disorientation)
- Can't distinguish ground from sky (sensory deprivation)
- Fatal errors: Walking in circles, missing shelter 50 ft away

**Wind Chill:**
- -40°F to -60°F common in blizzards
- Frostbite in minutes (see wind chill chart above)
- Breathing difficulties (cold air burns lungs)

**Snowdrift:**
- 5-15 feet drifts possible (buries structures, vehicles, people)
- Roads impassable (even 4WD)
- Shelters can be buried (need air vent)

**Duration:**
- 12-72 hours (multi-day events common)
- Power outages (lines down from ice/wind)
- No emergency services (roads closed)

---

### Blizzard Survival Protocol

#### Before Blizzard (Watch Issued)
- Stock firewood (bring indoors, enough for 7 days)
- Fill water containers (pipes may freeze)
- Charge devices
- Prepare emergency kit (shelter location)
- Bring pets indoors
- Check livestock (if applicable)

#### During Blizzard (Warning Issued)
1. **STAY INSIDE:** Do not travel (vehicles stranded = death trap)
2. **Stay in one room:** Easier to heat
3. **Conserve heat:** Close doors, hang blankets over windows
4. **Vent any heat source:** Carbon monoxide risk
5. **Melt snow for water:** If pipes freeze
6. **Avoid overexertion:** Heart attacks from shoveling common

#### If Caught Outside in Blizzard

**Shelter-in-Place Decision:**
- If you can't see landmarks (whiteout), STOP MOVING
- Build emergency shelter (snow cave, quinzee, wind break)
- Digging in snow = warmer than exposed to wind
- Wait out storm (24-72 hours)

**Emergency Snow Shelter:**
```
1. Find/dig into snowdrift (excavate chamber)
2. Create ventilation hole (CRITICAL - CO2 buildup)
3. Block entrance with snow blocks (leave small gap)
4. Sleeping platform raised above entrance (cold air sinks)
5. Interior temp: 20-35°F (vs -40°F outside)
```

**Body Heat Conservation:**
- Huddle together if group
- Insulate from ground (branches, pack, anything)
- Cover head (40% heat loss)
- Don't sweat (remove layers if digging)

#### If Stranded in Vehicle

**DO:**
- Stay in vehicle (better than exposure)
- Run engine 10 minutes per hour (heat)
- Crack window (ventilation, prevent CO poisoning)
- Clear exhaust pipe (snow blockage = CO into cab = death)
- Move arms/legs (circulation)
- Stay awake if possible (hypothermia risk when sleeping)
- Display distress signal (bright cloth on antenna, hood up)

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Leave vehicle to find help (white-out = disorientation = death)
- ❌ Run engine continuously (carbon monoxide + fuel consumption)
- ❌ Ignore exhaust pipe (CO kills quickly)

**Vehicle Survival Kit (Winter Midwest):**
- Sleeping bag or blankets (rated for -20°F)
- Candles + matches (small heat source, less CO than engine)
- Shovel (dig out, clear exhaust)
- High-calorie food
- Water (or snow to melt)
- Flashlight
- First aid
- **ALWAYS:** Keep tank 1/2 full (fuel for heating)

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Emergency snow shelter construction (cross-section), vehicle winter survival setup, visibility distance markers (whiteout progression).

## 4. FLASH FLOODS (Spring/Summer)

### Midwest Flash Flood Risk
**Primary Causes:**
- Severe thunderstorms (2-6 inches rain in 1-3 hours)
- Spring snowmelt (rapid thaw, saturated ground)
- Ice jams (rivers backup, sudden release)

**High-Risk Areas:**
- Small creeks/streams (fast response)
- Urban areas (runoff concentrates)
- Low-water crossings (roads dip through streams)
- Campgrounds in valleys

### Flash Flood Timeline
```
Intense thunderstorm begins → 30-60 min → Small creeks rise → 1-2 hours → Flash flood peak → 3-6 hours → Water recedes
```

**⚠️ WARNING SIGNS:**
- Sudden increase in creek noise (roar)
- Water color changes (muddy, debris)
- Debris floating upstream of current (water backing up)
- Animals fleeing area
- Distant rumble (wall of water approaching)

---

### Flood Survival Rules

#### Never Cross Flowing Water
**Depth Dangers:**
- **6 inches:** Can knock adult off feet
- **12 inches:** Can float small car
- **18-24 inches:** Can float most vehicles (including SUVs)

**Speed Dangers:**
- Slow-looking water = deceptive (underwater current 3x surface speed)
- Can't see depth, obstacles, drop-offs
- One wrong step = swept away

**TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN:** #1 cause of flood deaths is driving through water

#### If Swept Away by Flood

**Swift Water Survival:**
1. **Float on back, feet downstream:** Legs absorb impacts, not head
2. **Angle toward shore:** 45° angle, backpaddle toward edge
3. **Avoid "strainers":** Trees/debris that trap you underwater
4. **Grab stationary objects:** Rocks, trees (only if stable)
5. **Don't stand up in moving water:** Foot entrapment (underwater rocks trap foot, current pushes you under = drowning)

**Foot Entrapment Death Trap:**
- Fast current + knee-deep water = dangerous
- Foot wedges between rocks
- Current pushes body forward/under
- Can't pull foot free
- Drowning in 2 feet of water

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Water depth dangers (car/person scale), swift water survival positions, strainer hazard illustration.

- STARI (Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness)

**Geographic Range:** Southern Midwest (MO, KS, southern IL, IN, OH)  
**Size:** Medium (white spot on back of female)  
**Peak Season:** May-August

---

### Lyme Disease Profile

**Causative Agent:** *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacteria  
**Vector:** Blacklegged tick (deer tick)  
**Transmission Time:** 36-48 hours of attachment (early removal = low risk)

#### Lyme Disease Stages

**Stage 1: Early Localized (3-30 days post-bite)**
- **Erythema migrans (EM) rash:** "Bull's-eye" pattern (70-80% of cases)
  - Expands over days (3-12 inches diameter)
  - Not itchy or painful
  - Warm to touch
- Flu-like symptoms: Fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle aches
- **Treatment:** Antibiotics (doxycycline 100mg 2x/day for 14-21 days) = CURE if caught early

**Stage 2: Early Disseminated (weeks-months)**
- Multiple EM rashes (bacteria spread)
- Facial palsy (Bell's palsy - one side droops)
- Arthritis (knees swell)
- Heart problems (Lyme carditis - irregular heartbeat)
- Nerve pain, numbness

**Stage 3: Late Disseminated (months-years)**
- Chronic arthritis (knees, large joints)
- Neurological problems (memory, concentration, sleep)
- Chronic fatigue
- **Difficult to treat at this stage**

---

### Tick Prevention

#### Clothing & Repellent
- **Permethrin treatment:** Spray clothing (kills ticks on contact, lasts 6 weeks/multiple washes)
- **Long pants tucked into socks:** Physical barrier
- **Light-colored clothing:** Easier to spot ticks
- **DEET repellent on skin:** 20-30% concentration
- **Hat:** Keeps ticks out of hair

#### Behavior in Tick Habitat
- **Stay on trails:** Avoid brushing against vegetation (ticks quest on tips of grass/leaves)
- **Avoid sitting on logs, grass:** Use tarp or sit on rocks
- **Daily tick checks:** Full body inspection (see below)

#### Tick Check Protocol (CRITICAL)

**When:** Within 2 hours of coming out of tick habitat, then again before bed

**Where to Check (Priority Areas):**
1. **Scalp/hairline:** Run fingers through hair (feel for bumps)
2. **Behind ears:** Common attachment site
3. **Armpits:** Warm, moist, hidden
4. **Groin/genitals:** Warm, moist, hidden
5. **Behind knees:** Folds of skin
6. **Waistband area:** Ticks crawl up under clothing
7. **Belly button:** Hidden spot

**Why This Matters:** Removing tick within 24 hours = <1% Lyme risk. By 72 hours = 25%+ risk.

---

### Tick Removal (Proper Technique)

**Tools:** Fine-tipped tweezers (dedicated tick tweezers best)

**Steps:**
1. Grasp tick as close to skin as possible (at mouthparts, not body)
2. Pull upward with steady, even pressure (NO twisting)
3. Don't jerk (can break mouthparts off in skin)
4. Clean area with alcohol/soap
5. Save tick in plastic bag with date (for testing if symptoms develop)
6. Monitor bite site for 30 days (watch for rash)

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Burn tick off (causes regurgitation = more bacteria)
- ❌ Apply petroleum jelly/nail polish (same reason)
- ❌ Squeeze body (forces bacteria into wound)
- ❌ Twist while pulling (breaks mouthparts)

**If Mouthparts Break Off:**
- Try to remove with tweezers
- If can't remove, leave it (body will expel over time)
- Clean area, monitor for infection

**DIAGRAM SPEC:** Tick life stages and sizes (actual size comparison), proper removal technique illustrations, Lyme rash progression photos.

#### Timber Rattlesnake (*Crotalus horridus*)
**Range:** Southern Midwest (MO, IA, IL, IN, OH, WI - southern portions only)  
**Habitat:** Rocky bluffs, wooded hillsides, talus slopes  
**Size:** 3-5 feet, heavy-bodied  
**Behavior:**
- Reclusive, avoids humans
- Gives warning rattle
- Rarely strikes unless stepped on/cornered

**Lethality:** Low with medical care (<1% fatal), but serious envenomation

#### Massasauga Rattlesnake (*Sistrurus catenatus*)
**Range:** Great Lakes region (MI, OH, WI, northern IL, IN)  
**Habitat:** Wetlands, marshy areas, prairies  
**Size:** 18-30 inches (small)
