summary: "Abundant fall nut crop providing excellent starch, fat, and calories. Requires\
  \ tannin leaching before consumption but provides survival calories when properly\
  \ processed. White oak acorns (sweet) require less leaching than red oak (bitter).\
  \ Indigenous peoples used acorns as a dietary staple. One oak tree can produce 1,000-10,000\
  \ acorns per year."
steps:
- 'OAK IDENTIFICATION: Trees 30-100+ feet tall. LEAVES: White oak group = rounded lobes, no bristle tips. Red oak group = pointed lobes with bristle tips. BARK: White oak = light gray, scaly. Red oak = dark, ridged/furrowed. ACORNS: Nut in cup (cap), mature in fall. White oak acorns mature in 1 year (sweeter). Red oak acorns mature in 2 years (more bitter).'
- 'ACORN IDENTIFICATION BY SPECIES: WHITE OAK (Quercus alba): Large acorns (3/4-1 inch), cap covers 1/4 of nut, warty cap. BEST for eating - sweet, less tannin. BUR OAK (Q. macrocarpa): Very large acorns (1-2 inches), cap with fringe covers 1/2+ of nut. Sweet, low tannin. PIN OAK (Q. palustris): Small round acorns (1/2 inch), shallow cap. Bitter, high tannin (red oak group). LIVE OAK (Q. virginiana): Small pointed acorns (1/2-1 inch). Moderate tannin. NORTHERN RED OAK (Q. rubra): Large acorns (3/4-1 inch), flat cap. Very bitter, high tannin.'
- 'HARVEST TIMING (September-November): Wait for acorns to fall naturally (brown and mature). Collect fresh-fallen acorns from ground. Best immediately after falling - before animals eat them or they rot. Look for squirrel activity - they know where best acorns are. SUSTAINABLE HARVEST: Leave some for wildlife. Oaks produce massive surplus - harvesting 25-50% is sustainable.'
- 'SELECTION: Choose acorns that are: Brown (fully ripe), heavy (full of nutmeat), cap may or may not be attached (doesnt matter). REJECT: Green (unripe), with holes (insect damage - weevils), light weight (empty or rotten), moldy/black spots, floating in water (hollow/rotten).'
- 'SHELLING: Fresh acorns shell easier. Crack shell with nutcracker, rock, or hit with hammer. Or dry acorns 1-2 weeks until shells crack naturally. Remove brown skin (tannin-rich) by blanching in boiling water 1-2 min, then rubbing off. Nutmeat should be white to pale yellow.'
- 'LEACHING TANNINS - COLD WATER METHOD (preserves nutrients, takes days): Place chopped/ground acorn meal in bag (cloth, nylon stocking). Submerge in cold water (stream, bucket with water changes). Change water 2x per day. Takes 3-7 days depending on tannin level. Test by tasting - no bitterness means done. This method keeps starches from gelatinizing - makes better flour.'
- 'LEACHING TANNINS - HOT WATER METHOD (faster, takes hours): Boil chopped/ground acorns in large pot of water. When water turns brown (tea-colored), drain and add fresh water. Repeat 3-10 times until water stays clear and acorns taste sweet/bland (no bitterness). Takes 2-6 hours depending on species. Hot method causes starches to gelatinize - better for making mush/porridge.'
- 'SPECIES LEACHING TIME: White oak group (Q. alba, Q. macrocarpa): 1-3 days cold / 2-4 boils hot. Red oak group (Q. rubra, Q. palustris): 5-7 days cold / 6-10 boils hot. RULE: Keep leaching until no bitterness. Under-leached acorns cause nausea and kidney stress.'
- 'DRYING AND STORAGE: After leaching, spread acorn meal on trays. Dry in sun (3-5 days) or dehydrator (125°F until completely dry). Grind dried meal into flour using grain mill, mortar & pestle, or food processor. Store flour in airtight containers (cool, dry). Lasts 6-12 months. Can also freeze for longer storage (2+ years).'
- 'NUTRITIONAL VALUE (per 100g dried acorn flour): Calories: 387, Carbohydrates: 41g (starch-rich), Fat: 24g (good fat), Protein: 7g, Fiber: 9g. Also contains calcium, potassium, magnesium, B vitamins. Similar nutrition to almonds or chestnuts. Excellent survival food - calorie-dense.'
- 'PREPARATION AND USES: ACORN FLOUR: Substitute 25-50% for wheat flour in baking (no gluten, so needs binder). Makes excellent pancakes, breads, muffins. ACORN MUSH/PORRIDGE: Cook wet leached acorns with water until thick. Season with honey, berries, or salt. Traditional Native American staple. ACORN OIL: Cold-pressed oil from acorns (labor intensive). ROASTED ACORNS: Like chestnuts (still must leach first, then roast).'
- 'REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION: Oaks found throughout temperate Northern Hemisphere. North America: 90+ oak species from Canada to Mexico. Europe: 30+ species. Asia: Many species. White oak group preferred but ALL oak species have edible acorns after leaching. Regional species: Eastern US - white oak, red oak, pin oak. Western US - live oak, valley oak, blue oak. Southwest - Gambel oak, Emory oak.'
- 'HISTORICAL CONTEXT: Acorns were dietary staples for indigenous peoples worldwide. California tribes (Miwok, Pomo, Yokut) relied heavily on acorns - up to 50% of diet. Sophisticated leaching techniques using baskets and sand. Korean, Japanese, and Mediterranean cultures also have traditional acorn foods. During survival situations (wars, famines), acorns saved lives.'
warnings:
- Unleached acorns are VERY BITTER and can cause nausea, constipation, and kidney stress from tannins.
- Red oak acorns require significantly more leaching than white oak.
- Proper leaching is NON-NEGOTIABLE - taste test to confirm no bitterness.
- Do not confuse oak leaves with toxic plants - oaks are unmistakable by acorns.
- Acorn weevils common - check for holes, discard damaged nuts.
- Moldy acorns may contain aflatoxins - discard any with mold.

## Overview
Abundant fall nut crop requiring tannin leaching before consumption. Once processed, acorns provide excellent starch and fat. White oak group has less tannin than red oak.

## Step-by-step
1. Collect mature fallen acorns; discard any with holes (weevil damage).
2. Shell and chop or grind nutmeat.
3. Leach tannins by soaking in multiple changes of water (cold water: days; hot water: hours).
4. Test by tasting — should have no bitterness remaining.
5. Dry and grind into flour, or use wet paste directly in recipes.

## Warnings
- Unleached acorns are very bitter and can cause nausea/kidney stress.
- Red oak acorns require more leaching than white oak.
- Proper leaching is non-negotiable.
