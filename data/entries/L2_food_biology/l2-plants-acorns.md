summary: Abundant fall nut crop requiring tannin leaching before consumption. Once
  processed, acorns provide excellent starch and fat. White oak group has less tannin
  than red oak.
steps:
- Collect mature fallen acorns; discard any with holes (weevil damage).
- Shell and chop or grind nutmeat.
- 'Leach tannins by soaking in multiple changes of water (cold water: days; hot water:
  hours).'
- "Test by tasting \u2014 should have no bitterness remaining."
- Dry and grind into flour, or use wet paste directly in recipes.
warnings:
- Unleached acorns are very bitter and can cause nausea/kidney stress.
- Red oak acorns require more leaching than white oak.
- Proper leaching is non-negotiable.
