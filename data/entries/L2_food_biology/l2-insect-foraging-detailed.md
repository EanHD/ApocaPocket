summary: Insects are the most abundant and accessible animal protein source on Earth. Gram for gram, many insects contain more protein than beef. Over 2 billion people eat insects regularly. In a survival
  situation, overcoming squeamishness could mean the difference between adequate and inadequate protein intake.
warnings:
- 'AVOID: brightly colored insects (warning coloration = toxic), hairy caterpillars, biting/stinging insects, insects found on or near carrion, and any insect with a strong unpleasant smell'
- Always COOK insects before eating — this kills parasites and bacteria. Raw insects carry risk of parasitic infection.
- People with shellfish allergies may react to insects (similar chitin proteins) — start with tiny amounts
- Do not eat insects found in areas treated with pesticides
steps:
- 'CRICKETS AND GRASSHOPPERS: most widely eaten insects globally. High protein (65% dry weight), good fat content. Catch in early morning when cold and sluggish. Remove legs (they have barbs that scratch
  the throat). Roast on a hot rock, skewer over coals, or boil for 5 minutes. Taste: nutty, mild.'
- 'GRUBS AND LARVAE: beetle larvae found in rotting logs (especially palm, longhorn, and bark beetle larvae) are calorie-dense (fat content 30-40%). Split rotting logs and collect white/cream-colored larvae.
  Roast on a stick or hot rock until golden. Taste: buttery, slightly nutty. One of the highest calorie-per-effort survival foods.'
- 'ANTS: most species are edible. Large species (carpenter ants, leafcutter ants) are worthwhile. Place a stick in the nest — ants climb on, then shake into a container of water (drowns and rinses them).
  Boil for 5 minutes (destroys formic acid which causes stomach upset). Taste: citrusy/sour (from formic acid). Lemon ants (tropical) can be eaten raw.'
- 'TERMITES: extremely nutritious — 35% protein, 45% fat. Pound a stick into a termite mound, wait 5 minutes, withdraw covered in soldier termites. Or break open mound sections. Roast or eat raw (one of
  the few insects safe to eat raw in quantity). Taste: slightly nutty.'
- 'EARTHWORMS: purge for 24 hours in damp clean soil or grass (expels gut contents). Then boil, roast, or dry. 60% protein dry weight. Not insects technically, but ubiquitous. Taste: bland/earthy.'
- 'BEETLE LARVAE (mealworms): found in stored grain, under bark, in rotting wood. Roast until crispy on a hot rock or in a dry pan. High in protein and fat. Can be dried and ground into flour for adding
  to other foods.'
- 'COLLECTION METHODS: pitfall traps (cup buried flush with ground catches crawling insects overnight), light traps at night (insects attracted to fire or light fall into water bowl below), log splitting,
  rock flipping (morning — before insects warm up and flee), shaking vegetation over a cloth.'
- 'NUTRITIONAL VALUE: 100g of roasted crickets ≈ 120 calories, 13g protein, 5g fat. 100g of grubs ≈ 200 calories, 7g protein, 15g fat. For comparison: 100g of beef ≈ 250 calories, 26g protein. Insects are
  a legitimate, calorie-efficient protein source.'
- 'PROCESSING FOR STORAGE: roast until completely crispy, then grind into powder. Insect flour stores for weeks and can be mixed into soups, stews, or bread dough for invisible protein supplementation (useful
  for overcoming psychological resistance in group members).'

# Insect Foraging — Identification and Preparation

Insects are the most abundant and accessible animal protein source on Earth. Gram for gram, many insects contain more protein than beef. Over 2 billion people eat insects regularly. In a survival situation, overcoming squeamishness could mean the difference between adequate and inadequate protein intake.
