## Overview
Minimum macronutrient needs shift under survival stress. Caloric needs increase with cold, exertion, and injury. Fat is the most calorie-dense macronutrient and critical for long-term survival.

## Step-by-step
1. Baseline adult needs: ~2000-2500 kcal/day sedentary; 3000-4500+ under heavy exertion or cold.
2. Protein: 0.8-1.2g/kg body weight minimum. Critical for wound healing and muscle maintenance.
3. Fat: 9 kcal/g (vs 4 for protein/carbs). Prioritize fat sources for caloric efficiency.
4. Carbohydrates: primary quick energy. Grains, tubers, fruits, honey.
5. Prioritize calories over nutritional balance in acute survival — starvation kills faster than deficiency.

## Warnings
- Protein-only diet without fat/carbs causes 'rabbit starvation' — potentially fatal.
- Caloric deficit compounds rapidly under cold exposure.
- Dehydration mimics hunger — hydrate first.
