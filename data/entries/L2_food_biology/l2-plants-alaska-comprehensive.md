# Alaska Edible Plants - Comprehensive Field Guide

**🌲 ALASKA FORAGING REALITY**: Short growing season (May-September), but abundant wild edibles. Focus on berries (high calories), greens (vitamins), and roots (carbs).

**⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY**: Always cross-reference with l2-plants-deadly-lookalikes.md. Some edibles have toxic lookalikes.

## 🫐 Berries (High Priority - Calorie Dense)

### Blueberry (*Vaccinium* species)

**ID Features:**
- Shrub: 6 inches to 3 feet tall (varies by species)
- Leaves: Small (1/2 to 1 inch), oval, smooth edges, alternate arrangement
- Berries: Blue-black with powdery coating (bloom), 5-pointed crown on bottom
- Season: July-September (peak: August)

**Habitat**: Tundra, alpine meadows, forest clearings, acidic soil

**Harvest**: Pick when fully blue (sweet), avoid red/purple (unripe, tart)

**Yield**: 1-3 lbs per hour (good patches)

**Nutrition**: ~60 calories per cup, high in antioxidants, vitamin C

**Preparation**: Eat raw, dry for winter (sun or smoke), mash and cook with meat

### Salmonberry (*Rubus spectabilis*)

**ID Features:**
- Shrub: 3-6 feet tall, thorny stems (like raspberry)
- Leaves: Compound, 3 leaflets, toothed edges
- Flowers: Pink to magenta (spring), 5 petals
- Berries: Orange to red, raspberry-shaped, soft texture
- Season: June-August

**Habitat**: Coastal rainforests, stream banks, moist forests

**Harvest**: Pick when fully colored (soft), fragile (eat soon)

**Yield**: 0.5-1 lb per hour (scattered growth)

**Nutrition**: ~50 calories per cup, high vitamin C

**Preparation**: Eat raw (best), too soft for drying, make into jam

**Note**: Young shoots edible (peel, eat raw or cooked in spring)

### Cloudberry (*Rubus chamaemorus*)

**ID Features:**
- Low herbaceous plant: 3-6 inches tall
- Leaves: Maple-like, 5-7 lobes, wrinkled texture
- Flowers: White, 5 petals (summer)
- Berries: Start red, turn golden-amber when ripe (August)
- Season: August-September

**Habitat**: Tundra, bogs, wet meadows (muskeg)

**Harvest**: Pick when golden-amber (soft, sweet), red = unripe (tart)

**Yield**: 0.25-0.5 lb per hour (sparse, worth effort for taste)

**Nutrition**: ~50 calories per cup, extremely high vitamin C (4x oranges)

**Preparation**: Eat raw (prized flavor), preserve with sugar or fat

**Cultural Note**: Highly valued by Alaska Natives ("aqpik" in Inupiaq)

### Crowberry (*Empetrum nigrum*)

**ID Features:**
- Low shrub: 2-6 inches tall, mat-forming
- Leaves: Tiny (1/4 inch), needle-like, evergreen
- Berries: Black, shiny, 1/4 inch diameter, persistent (stay on plant into winter)
- Season: August-October (can harvest into spring if snow-covered)

**Habitat**: Tundra, alpine, heathlands

**Harvest**: Pick black berries (ripe), strip from branches

**Yield**: 0.5-1 lb per hour (abundant in tundra)

**Nutrition**: ~30 calories per cup (watery, low sugar)

**Preparation**: Eat raw (bland, slightly bitter), mix with other berries, make "akutaq" (Eskimo ice cream with fat)

**Storage**: Freeze naturally (stay edible all winter)

### Lingonberry / Lowbush Cranberry (*Vaccinium vitis-idaea*)

**ID Features:**
- Low shrub: 3-6 inches tall, evergreen

**Habitat**: Tundra, alpine, boreal forest understory

**Harvest**: Pick fully red (still tart), sweeter after first frost

**Yield**: 0.5-1 lb per hour

**Nutrition**: ~45 calories per cup, high vitamin C, benzoic acid (natural preservative)

**Preparation**: Too tart raw (eat if desperate), cook with sweetener, make sauce for meat

**Storage**: Naturally preserves (benzoic acid inhibits spoilage), lasts months unrefrigerated

## 🍽️ Preparation Methods

### Raw Consumption (When Safe)

**Best Raw:**
- All berries (once ripe)
- Wild potato roots (sweet, crunchy)
- Young dandelion leaves (bitter but edible)
- Cattail shoots (inner white core)
- Fireweed shoots (young, peeled)

**Advantages**: Preserves vitamin C, no fuel needed

**Risks**: Parasites (giardia, etc. from animal contamination), digestive upset (unfamiliar foods)

### Boiling (Most Versatile)

**Advantages**: Kills parasites, softens tough plants, reduces bitterness, safe

**Method**:
1. Boil water (rolling boil)
2. Add plant material (greens, roots, shoots)
3. Cook 5-15 minutes (until tender)
4. Change water if bitter (dandelion, older fireweed)

**What to Boil:**
- All greens (fireweed, dandelion, fiddleheads)
- Roots (wild potato, cattail)
- Wild rhubarb stalks

### Roasting (High Calorie Plants)

**Method**:
1. Wrap in leaves or foil
2. Place in coals (not flames)
3. Rotate occasionally
4. Cook 15-30 minutes (until soft)

**What to Roast:**
- Wild potato roots (caramelizes, sweet flavor)
- Cattail roots
- Dandelion roots (coffee substitute)

### Drying (Long-Term Storage)

**Method**:
1. Slice thin (1/4 inch)
2. Hang in sun or near fire (120-140°F)
3. Dry until brittle (1-3 days)
4. Store in dry container

**What to Dry:**
- Blueberries (rehydrate in soups, eat as snack)
- Lingonberries
- Fireweed leaves (tea)
- Wild potato roots (grind to flour)

**Storage Time**: 6-12 months (if kept dry)

## 📊 Nutritional Strategy

### Calorie Sources (Priority in Survival)

**Highest Calories:**
1. Berries: 45-70 calories per cup (sugar)
2. Wild potato roots: ~80 calories per cup (starch)
3. Cattail roots: ~100 calories per cup (starch)
4. Nuts (hazelnuts, if found): ~800 calories per cup

**Reality Check**: Plants alone won't sustain you long-term. Need 2000-3000 calories per day (active survival). Berries provide 200-400 calories per day (realistic foraging). **Must supplement with meat, fish, or animal fat.**

### Vitamin Sources (Prevent Deficiency Diseases)

**Vitamin C (Scurvy Prevention):**
- Cloudberries (highest)
- Wild rhubarb stalks
- Fireweed shoots
- Rose hips (fall)

**Vitamin A (Night Vision, Immune Function):**
- Dandelion greens
- Fireweed leaves
- Fiddleheads

**Iron (Anemia Prevention):**
- Dandelion greens
- Fiddleheads
- Fireweed

### Balanced Foraging Day (Example)

**Morning (2 hours):**
- 2 cups blueberries (~120 calories, vitamin C)
- 1 cup wild potato roots (~80 calories, starch)
- Handful fireweed shoots (~20 calories, vitamins)

**Afternoon (1 hour):**
- 1 cup lingonberries (~45 calories, preservative properties)
- 1 cup cattail shoots (~30 calories, fiber)

**Evening:**
- Cook all greens together (soup)
- Eat berries raw or with meat (if available)
- Roast roots (easier to digest)

**Total Plant Calories**: ~300-400 calories (not enough alone, need animal protein/fat)

## 🔍 Field Identification Tips

### Positive ID Checklist (Use Multiple Features)

**Never rely on just one trait.** Use at least 3-4:

1. **Habitat**: Where does it grow? (wet, dry, sun, shade)
2. **Leaf shape & arrangement**: (opposite, alternate, compound, simple)
3. **Stem characteristics**: (woody, herbaceous, hollow, color)
4. **Flowers**: (color, petal count, shape)
5. **Fruit/seeds**: (berry, pod, nuts)
6. **Smell**: (crush leaves, distinctive odor?)
7. **Season**: (when does it grow, flower, fruit?)

### Bring Field Guides (Laminated, Waterproof)

**Recommended Guides:**
- *Alaska's Wild Berries and Berry-Like Fruit* - Alaska Cooperative Extension
- *Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West* - Gregory Tilford
- *Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast* - Pojar & MacKinnon

### Take Photos (For Later Verification)

- Multiple angles (whole plant, leaves, flowers, close-ups)
- Scale reference (hand, ruler, coin)
- Habitat (surroundings, other plants nearby)

---

**Final Thought**: Alaska's short season concentrates plant growth into 4-5 months. Learn to identify plants during flowering (easiest), then harvest throughout the season. 

**Berries = calories. Greens = vitamins. Roots = carbs.**

**But plants alone won't keep you alive.** Focus on hunting and fishing for protein and fat. Use plants to supplement and prevent deficiency diseases.

**Know your plants. Know your season. Know your limits.**
