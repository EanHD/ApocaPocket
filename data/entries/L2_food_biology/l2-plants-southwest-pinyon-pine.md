summary: Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis and related species) produces pine nuts - small, oily, calorie-dense seeds. A traditional staple food. Good mast crop every 3-7 years. One of the highest-calorie wild
  foods.
warnings:
- Pine nuts are labor-intensive to harvest and shell
- Good crops are unpredictable (every few years)
- Raw pine nuts can cause digestive upset in some people - roasting improves digestibility
- Pine pitch is very sticky - difficult to remove from hands and tools
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Small pine tree, 10-30 feet. Short needles in bundles of 2. Large woody cones with thick scales. Seeds (pine nuts) are 1/2 inch, brown, wingless. Dry slopes, 5000-9000 feet elevation.'
- 'HARVEST: Late summer to fall when cones open. Collect cones from ground or tree. Heat cones over fire to help scales open. Shake out seeds.'
- 'PROCESSING: Remove shell (hard outer coat). Methods: (1) Roast nuts lightly, shells crack easier. (2) Use rock to crack individual nuts. (3) Place nuts in bag, crush gently with rock, winnow to separate
  shells. Labor-intensive.'
- 'USES: Eat raw or roasted (roasting improves flavor and digestibility). Grind into flour or meal. Add to stews, baking, pemmican.'
- 'NUTRITION: Extremely high calorie - 190 cal per ounce (similar to other tree nuts). High fat (healthy oils), protein, vitamin E, magnesium. One of the best wild calorie sources.'
