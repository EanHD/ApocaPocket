summary: Death camas (Zigadenus/Toxicoscordion species) is a DEADLY plant that looks nearly identical to edible camas (Camassia) when not flowering. Contains potent cardiac alkaloids that cause heart failure. This is the PRIMARY reason you must NEVER harvest camas bulbs unless you have positively identified the plant while flowering.
warnings:
- DEADLY - Can cause fatal heart failure in humans and livestock
- Looks nearly IDENTICAL to edible camas when not flowering
- ALL PARTS are toxic - bulbs, leaves, flowers, seeds
- Single bulb can kill a child, 3-6 bulbs can kill an adult
- NO RELIABLE ANTIDOTE - treatment is supportive only
- Toxins are cardiac glycosides - cause irregular heartbeat and heart failure
- NEVER harvest any camas-like bulb unless you saw blue flowers on that specific plant
- Most deaths occur when foragers dig bulbs without confirming flower color

# Death Camas — DEADLY Camas Lookalike

Death camas (Zigadenus/Toxicoscordion species) is a DEADLY plant that looks nearly identical to edible camas (Camassia) when not flowering. Contains potent cardiac alkaloids that cause heart failure. This is the PRIMARY reason you must NEVER harvest camas bulbs unless you have positively identified the plant while flowering.

## Step-by-step Identification

### DEATH CAMAS (Zigadenus/Toxicoscordion species)

**Critical Features:**
- **FLOWERS:** CREAM to WHITE (occasionally yellowish), star-shaped, 6 petals/tepals with greenish or yellow gland at base of each
- **FLOWER ARRANGEMENT:** RACEME (elongated cluster) or panicle
- **BLOOM TIME:** May-July
- **LEAVES:** Grass-like, basal, V-shaped in cross-section, bluish-green with waxy coating, 8-20 inches long
- **BULB:** Onion-like, 1-2 inches, dark outer coating, NO ONION SMELL
- **HABITAT:** Same as camas - wet meadows, prairies, open slopes
- **HEIGHT:** 1-2 feet
- **SPECIES:** Z. venenosus (meadow death camas), Z. paniculatus (foothill death camas), Toxicoscordion fremontii

### EDIBLE CAMAS (Camassia quamash) - FOR COMPARISON

**Critical Features:**
- **FLOWERS:** DEEP BLUE to BLUE-PURPLE (rarely white variants exist - avoid these!)
- **FLOWER ARRANGEMENT:** RACEME (elongated cluster)
- **BLOOM TIME:** April-June
- **LEAVES:** Grass-like, basal, similar to death camas but greener
- **BULB:** Onion-like, 1-2 inches, NO ONION SMELL
- **HABITAT:** Wet meadows, prairies
- **HEIGHT:** 1-2 feet

### CRITICAL DIFFERENCES

**WHEN FLOWERING:**
- **FLOWER COLOR** is the ONLY reliable field distinction
- **CAMAS:** Deep blue-purple
- **DEATH CAMAS:** White/cream/yellowish
- **IF FLOWERS ARE NOT BLUE, DO NOT HARVEST**

**NOTE:** Rare white variants of true camas do exist. If you cannot be 100% certain, DO NOT HARVEST.

## Why You Cannot Identify by Bulb Alone

When not flowering, death camas and edible camas are nearly impossible to distinguish:
- Bulbs look identical
- Leaves look very similar
- Habitat is identical
- Growth habit is identical

This is why traditional foragers ONLY harvested camas during/after flowering when blue flowers confirmed identity.

## Symptoms of Death Camas Poisoning

**ONSET:** 30 minutes to 3 hours

**EARLY SYMPTOMS:**
- Excessive salivation, nausea, vomiting
- Burning in mouth and throat
- Abdominal pain, diarrhea

**CARDIAC SYMPTOMS:**
- Slow irregular heartbeat
- Low blood pressure
- Difficulty breathing
- Weakness, tremors

**LATE SYMPTOMS:**
- Severe bradycardia (slow heart)
- Heart block
- Seizures, coma
- Death from cardiac arrest

**Duration:** Symptoms can last 24-48 hours even with treatment

## Field Treatment

- **NO SPECIFIC ANTIDOTE**
- Call emergency services immediately
- If recent ingestion (&lt;30 min) and patient conscious: induce vomiting or activated charcoal (1g per kg)
- Keep patient lying down and calm - minimize cardiac stress
- Monitor pulse constantly - cardiac arrest is primary danger
- Provide CPR if needed
- Hospital care critical for cardiac monitoring and support

## Safe Foraging Protocol for Camas

1. Visit the site in spring (April-June) when plants are flowering
2. Mark locations with blue-flowered camas plants (GPS, stakes, photos)
3. **ONLY dig bulbs from marked locations** where you confirmed blue flowers
4. Dig in summer/fall after flowering is complete
5. If you see ANY white-flowered plants nearby, be extra cautious
6. **When in doubt, throw it out** - no meal is worth your life

## Regional Distribution

**Death Camas Distribution:**
- Western North America (British Columbia to California, east to Montana and New Mexico)
- Primarily west of Rocky Mountains
- Most common in foothills and mountain meadows
- Meadow death camas (Z. venenosus) is the most common species
- Also found in eastern North America (less common)

## Historical Context

Death camas poisoning has killed countless livestock (sheep, cattle, horses) and caused human deaths throughout history. Indigenous peoples were well aware of death camas and developed strict protocols for camas harvesting - ONLY during flowering season. European settlers who ignored these protocols often died.

## Warnings
- **DEADLY** - Can cause fatal heart failure
- Looks nearly IDENTICAL to edible camas when not flowering
- ALL PARTS toxic - bulbs, leaves, flowers, seeds
- Single bulb can kill a child, 3-6 bulbs can kill an adult
- NO RELIABLE ANTIDOTE - treatment is supportive only
- Toxins are cardiac glycosides - cause irregular heartbeat and heart failure
- **NEVER harvest any camas-like bulb unless you saw blue flowers on that specific plant**
- Most deaths occur when foragers dig bulbs without confirming flower color
