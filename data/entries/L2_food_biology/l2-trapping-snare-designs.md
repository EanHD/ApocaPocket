summary: 'Passive trapping is 10-100x more efficient than active hunting. Set 10-20 snares along game trails and check twice daily. Five designs cover 90% of small game situations: simple loop, spring pole,
  drag, deadfall, and box/funnel trap.'
warnings:
- In a non-survival situation, trapping without a license is illegal in most jurisdictions
- Check traps at least every 12 hours — animals suffering in traps attract predators to your area and the meat spoils quickly
- Deadfall traps can injure you during setup — test the trigger mechanism with a stick, not your hand
- Wire snares last longer than cordage — 20 gauge brass or steel wire is ideal. Carry snare wire in your kit.
- Human scent deters animals — handle snares with gloves or rub them with mud, charcoal, or local vegetation
steps:
- 'SIMPLE LOOP SNARE: the most basic and most effective trap. Make a loop from wire or strong cordage with a locking mechanism (simple overhand knot that slides but doesn''t loosen). Size loop to target:
  rabbit = 4-inch diameter, placed 3-4 inches off ground. Squirrel = 2.5 inches, placed on a pole leaned against a tree. Anchor to a stake or sturdy branch. Set on game trails (look for tracks, droppings,
  worn paths).'
- 'SPRING POLE SNARE: attach snare loop to the end of a bent sapling (spring pole). Use a trigger mechanism: notched stake in ground + notched toggle on snare line. When animal enters loop and pulls, toggle
  releases from stake, sapling springs up, lifting animal off ground (away from other predators). Set at trail chokepoints. Best for rabbits and raccoon-sized game.'
- 'DRAG SNARE: like a simple loop but anchored to a heavy drag log (3-5 lbs) instead of a fixed point. When the animal runs, it drags the log which catches on brush and tangles, exhausting the animal without
  breaking the snare. This prevents the animal from chewing through a fixed anchor point. Better for larger game (fox, raccoon).'
- 'FIGURE-4 DEADFALL TRAP: three sticks notched to form a figure-4 shape supporting a heavy flat rock (20+ lbs — 5x the target animal''s weight). Vertical stick has a notch near the bottom holding bait.
  Diagonal stick connects vertical to horizontal. Horizontal stick props up the rock. Animal takes bait, pulls vertical stick, trigger collapses, rock falls. Kills instantly if rock is heavy enough. Effective
  for rodents and small mammals.'
- 'BOX/FUNNEL TRAP: build a cone or funnel shape from sticks driven into the ground, narrowing to an entrance just large enough for the target animal. Place bait inside at the narrow end. For fish: build
  in a stream with rocks and sticks, funnel points upstream. Fish swim in following the current and can''t find the narrow exit. For land animals: add a one-way door (angled sticks that push open inward
  but not outward).'
- 'TRAP PLACEMENT: set on ACTIVE game trails — look for fresh tracks, droppings, chewed vegetation, fur on branches. Funnel animals into traps using stick fences: line sticks along both sides of the trail,
  narrowing to the trap. This is called ''channeling'' and dramatically increases catch rate.'
- 'BAIT SELECTION: rabbit — apple, carrot, fresh greens. Squirrel — nuts, seeds, peanut butter. Raccoon — fish, sweet fruit, marshmallows. Fox — meat scraps, fish. Universal attractant: peanut butter on
  a stick (if available).'
- 'NUMBERS GAME: even expert trappers have a 10-20% success rate per snare per night. Set MINIMUM 10 snares to reliably catch food. More is better. Spread across multiple trails and areas. Check and reset
  twice daily — dawn and dusk.'
- 'PROCESSING: kill trapped animals quickly and humanely (sharp blow to base of skull). Gut immediately — slit belly from sternum to pelvis, remove all organs. Save heart, liver, kidneys (edible and nutrient-dense).
  Rinse body cavity. Skin by pulling hide from legs toward head.'
- 'CORDAGE SNARES: if no wire, use the strongest cordage available. Best natural options: rawhide strips (strongest), inner bark of basswood/cedar twisted into rope, paracord inner strands, fishing line
  (for small game). Cordage snares need to be checked MORE frequently as animals can chew through them.'
