summary: Without refrigeration, use cool dry storage, underground caches, hanging (air circulation), and separation by type. Root cellars (underground, 0-10C) store root vegetables, apples months. Grain
  in sealed containers protects from rodents, moisture.
warnings:
- Rodents destroy food - use sealed metal or glass containers
- Moisture causes mold - keep storage area dry
- Some foods emit ethylene gas (apples) which spoils nearby foods - store separately
- Check stored food regularly for spoilage
steps:
- 'ROOT CELLAR: Dig into hillside or underground (below frost line). Insulated door, vent for air circulation. Maintains 0-10C year-round. Store potatoes, carrots, beets, apples, cured meat.'
- 'UNDERGROUND CACHE: Dig hole, line with bark/plastic. Store food in sealed containers. Cover with dirt, mark location. Protects from animals. Check for moisture.'
- 'HANGING: Suspend food from rafters (air circulates, rodents cannot reach). Good for cured meat, dried herbs, onions/garlic braids.'
- 'GRAIN STORAGE: Sealed metal drums or glass jars. Add bay leaves (repels insects). Cool dry location. Wheat, rice, beans last years if dry.'
- 'SEPARATION: Store by type and smell. Strong-smelling foods (onions, fish) separate from mild (grains). Apples separate from other produce (ethylene gas).'

# Food Caching — Long-Term Storage Without Refrigeration

Without refrigeration, use cool dry storage, underground caches, hanging (air circulation), and separation by type. Root cellars (underground, 0-10C) store root vegetables, apples months. Grain in sealed containers protects from rodents, moisture.
