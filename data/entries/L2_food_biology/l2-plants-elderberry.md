## Overview
Shrub/small tree producing clusters of small dark berries. Berries MUST be cooked — raw berries, leaves, bark, and stems contain cyanogenic glycosides.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify by compound leaves with 5-7 serrated leaflets, flat-topped white flower clusters, and dark purple-black berry clusters.
2. Harvest fully ripe dark berries only.
3. Cook berries before eating — boil into syrup, jam, or wine.
4. Flowers can be used raw for tea or fritters (elderflower).

## Warnings
- RAW berries cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
- Leaves, bark, stems, roots, and unripe berries are TOXIC.
- Water elderberry (Sambucus racemosa — red berries) is more toxic.
- Pokeweed berry clusters look similar — check leaf shape (simple vs compound).
