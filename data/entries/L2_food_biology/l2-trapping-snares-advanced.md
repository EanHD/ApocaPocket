# Advanced Snares & Trapping ⭐⭐⭐

**Level:** L2 (Intermediate)  
**Category:** Trapping & Hunting  
**Difficulty:** Moderate to Advanced  
**Setup Time:** 15 minutes to 2 hours per trap  
**Effectiveness:** EXTREMELY HIGH - passive hunting 24/7

## Why This Is Underrated

Modern people think traps are "cheating" or "primitive desperation." This is spectacularly wrong. Snares were humanity's **primary protein source** for 100,000+ years - predating bows, atlatls, and projectile weapons. A single skilled trapper can set 20-30 snares and harvest 5-10 animals per day with ZERO active hunting. Snares work while you sleep, work silently, require no ammunition, and never miss. In a long-term survival scenario, snares are MORE valuable than guns.

**The truth:** Trapping is not a backup plan. It's THE plan. Active hunting is the backup.

## Historical Context

- **Age:** 100,000+ years (older than projectile weapons)
- **Primary hunting method:** Before bow invention (~15,000 years ago), snares provided most protein
- **Indigenous mastery:** Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, African San people relied on snares as PRIMARY food source
- **Fur trade era:** Mountain men set 100+ traps per season (industrial-scale protein harvesting)
- **Military survival:** POWs, downed pilots, evaders used snares when ammunition exhausted
- **Modern subsistence:** Arctic communities still use snares (legal traditional method)

**Why it worked:** One person setting 30 snares = 30 "hunters" working simultaneously. Force multiplication.

## Why Snares Are Superior

### Vs. Active Hunting
1. **No human presence:** Animals walk into traps without seeing/smelling hunter
2. **24/7 operation:** Traps work while you sleep, eat, travel, build shelter
3. **No ammunition:** Infinite "shots" - snare reusable for weeks
4. **No noise:** Zero sound (stealth protein in hostile territory)
5. **Multiple locations:** Cover 5-10 square miles with trap line

### Vs. Firearms
- **Guns run out of ammo:** Snares work indefinitely
- **Guns make noise:** Snares are silent (don't reveal position)
- **Guns require skill:** Snares require knowledge (different skill set, easier to learn)

### Historical Reality
- **Mountain men:** 200-300 beaver per season (1-2 bullets per season for defense)
- **Subsistence trappers:** 80%+ of calories from traps, 20% from hunting
- **POW survival:** Escapees survived months on snared game (no weapons, no noise)

## Snare Types

### 1. Simple Loop Snare
**Best for:** Rabbits, squirrels, small game  
**Setup time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Materials:** Wire or cordage (3-4 feet)

#### Construction
- Loop size: 4-6" diameter (fist-sized)
- Height: 3-4" off ground (head height for target animal)
- Attachment: Tied to solid anchor (tree, stake, heavy log)

#### How it works
- Animal runs through loop (head enters)
- Forward motion tightens loop around neck
- Animal struggles, loop constricts (death by strangulation, 30-60 seconds)

### 2. Spring Snare (Killer Snare)
**Best for:** Rabbits, marten, fox, raccoon  
**Setup time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Materials:** Wire, flexible sapling or spring pole, trigger mechanism

#### Construction
- **Spring pole:** Bent sapling (8-15 feet tall, 1-2" diameter)
- **Trigger:** Figure-4 or Paiute (holds spring under tension)
- **Loop:** Positioned in game trail (head height)
- **Action:** Trigger releases, spring yanks animal upward (breaks neck instantly)

#### Advantages
- **Quick kill:** Instant or near-instant (humane)
- **Predator protection:** Animal lifted off ground (coyotes, foxes can't steal)
- **Clear indicator:** Sprung trap visible from distance (check trap line efficiently)

### 3. Drag Snare
**Best for:** Larger game (fox, coyote, beaver) where stakes might pull out  
**Setup time:** 20-30 minutes  
**Materials:** Wire, heavy drag weight (log, stone)

#### Construction
- Loop attached to LOG (15-30 lbs) via 6-10 feet of wire
- Animal caught, tries to run, drags log
- Log catches on brush, roots (animal exhausts itself)
- Heavier animal = heavier log needed

#### Advantages
- **No pull-out:** Log moves with animal (vs stake that pulls out)
- **Tires animal:** Dragging weight exhausts animal (easier to dispatch)
- **Larger game:** Can catch animals too strong for fixed snares

### 4. Squirrel Pole
**Best for:** Squirrels, climbing rodents  
**Setup time:** 20 minutes  
**Materials:** Pole (8-12 feet), multiple wire snares

#### Construction
- Lean pole against tree (45° angle)
- Attach 3-5 small loop snares along pole (2-3" diameter)
- Squirrels run up pole, head enters loop, falls off (hangs by neck)

#### Advantages
- **Multiple catches:** 3-5 snares per pole (harvest multiple animals)
- **Self-baiting:** Squirrels naturally climb leaning poles
- **High success rate:** 50%+ capture rate in active squirrel areas

## Materials

### Wire (Best)
- **Type:** Snare wire, picture hanging wire, brass wire (22-24 gauge for rabbits, 18-20 for larger)
- **Advantages:** Doesn't stretch, smooth (won't snag), reusable 20+ times
- **Lock mechanism:** Make sliding loop with small fixed loop at one end
- **Caution:** Can be visible (darken with smoke or mud)

### Cordage (Traditional)
- **Natural:** Braided plant fiber (nettle, milkweed, dogbane), rawhide, sinew
- **Modern:** Paracord, bankline (tarred), braided fishing line
- **Advantages:** Quiet (no metallic sound), biodegradable, less visible
- **Disadvantages:** Can stretch, may fray, less durable (5-10 catches before replacement)

### Making Wire Loops
1. Thread wire through small fixed loop (creates sliding noose)
2. OR: Make small loop with double overhand knot, thread wire through
3. Test: Pull loop - should slide smoothly and tighten

## Placement Strategy (THE CRITICAL SKILL)

### Reading Sign
- **Tracks:** Fresh tracks (sharp edges, moist soil disturbed)
- **Scat:** Fresh droppings (moist, not dried out)
- **Trails:** Worn paths (vegetation compressed, soil packed)
- **Runs:** Tunnels under brush (rabbits, small game)
- **Rubs:** Hair on fences, bark scratches (animal height markers)

### Optimal Locations
1. **Game trails:** Well-worn paths (animals use same routes repeatedly)
2. **Funnels:** Natural choke points (between trees, rocks, brush)
3. **Water sources:** Streams, ponds (animals visit daily)
4. **Den entrances:** Burrows, hollow logs (animal must exit/enter)
5. **Food sources:** Berry patches, nut trees, crop fields

### Placement Rules
- **Don't modify trail:** Disturbed vegetation alerts animals (they avoid)
- **Camouflage wire:** Darken with mud, smoke, or natural oxidation
- **Multiple snares:** Set 5-10 in area (increases odds)
- **Check daily:** Trapped animals decay, predators steal (check every 24 hours)

## Trigger Mechanisms

### Figure-4 Trigger
**Use:** Deadfall traps, spring snares  
**Setup:** Three sticks carved with notches (form "4" shape)  
**Action:** Animal disturbs bait stick, trigger collapses, releases weight/spring

#### Advantages
- Simple (3 sticks, knife, 10 minutes)
- Sensitive (light touch releases)
- Adjustable tension

### Paiute Deadfall Trigger
**Use:** Deadfall traps, highly sensitive  
**Setup:** Stick + cordage toggle mechanism  
**Action:** Lightest touch releases (catches mice, small birds)

#### Advantages
- MOST sensitive trigger (catches very small game)
- No carving needed (cordage-based)
- Fast setup (5 minutes)

### Spring Pole Trigger
**Use:** Spring snares  
**Setup:** Bent sapling held by trigger stick (releases when animal enters loop)  
**Action:** Trigger releases, spring pole yanks animal upward

## Ethics & Best Practices

### Humane Trapping
- **Check traps daily:** Minimizes suffering (animal trapped <24 hours)
- **Kill quickly:** Dispatch immediately (don't leave suffering)
- **Appropriate snares:** Use loop size for target animal (too large = escape, too small = body catch)
- **Avoid leg snares:** Go for neck snares (quicker death)

### Non-Target Release
- **Wrong species:** Release unharmed if possible
- **Too small:** Release (undersized animals for population health)
- **Protected species:** Release immediately (know local wildlife)

### Trap Line Management
- **Map your traps:** Remember locations (easy to forget after 20+ traps)
- **Mark with natural signs:** Stone cairn, stick marker (not flagging - alerts humans)
- **Harvest promptly:** Check line every morning (before predators find catches)

## Modern Applications

### Survival Scenarios
- **Long-term protein:** When ammunition exhausted, traps continue working
- **Low-energy hunting:** Injured, sick, or weak individuals can still eat (traps work without effort)
- **Stealth:** Hostile territory, need protein without gunshots

### Subsistence Hunting
- **Legal in many areas:** Alaska, Canada, tribal lands (traditional methods protected)
- **Supplement income:** Fur trade still exists (beaver, marten, fox pelts worth $20-100 each)

### Pest Control
- **Agricultural damage:** Rabbits, groundhogs, marmots (property owner permission)
- **Invasive species:** Nutria, feral hogs (some states pay bounties)

## Legal Considerations

### United States (Varies by State)
- **Trapping license required:** Most states require license for any trapping
- **Seasons:** Furbearers have specific seasons (fall/winter typically)
- **Trap types:** Some states ban certain snare types (neck snares legal, leg snares often banned)
- **Checking frequency:** Many states require 24-hour check intervals
- **Landowner permission:** Always required on private property

### Federal Land
- **National Forests:** Some permit trapping with state license
- **National Parks:** Trapping generally prohibited (except subsistence in Alaska)
- **BLM Land:** Often allows trapping with state license

### Survival Situations
- **Emergency exception:** Life-or-death situations typically not prosecuted
- **Military survival:** Armed forces exempt in training/combat situations
- **Lost person:** Courts unlikely to prosecute for survival trapping

**ALWAYS check local regulations before setting traps in non-emergency situations.**

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Animals avoid snares
- **Cause:** Human scent, disturbed area, visible wire
- **Fix:** Wear gloves, minimize vegetation disturbance, darken wire with mud

### Problem: Animals escape snares
- **Cause:** Loop too large, weak material, improper placement
- **Fix:** Reduce loop size, use stronger wire/cordage, reposition for tighter fit

### Problem: Predators steal catches
- **Cause:** Trap on ground (accessible to foxes, coyotes)
- **Fix:** Use spring snares (lifts animal off ground), check traps more frequently

### Problem: Snares sprung with no catch
- **Cause:** Too sensitive (wind, falling branches), or animal escaped
- **Fix:** Adjust trigger sensitivity, check for hair/tracks (escaped animal)

## Training Program

### Week 1: Build Skills
- Construct 5 each: simple loop, spring snare, drag snare
- Practice trigger mechanisms (Figure-4, Paiute)
- Study local game trails (identify tracks, scat, runs)

### Week 2: Test Traps (Non-Lethal)
- Set traps without loop (test trigger mechanisms only)
- Observe animal behavior (do they use trail, avoid trap?)
- Adjust placement based on observations

### Week 3-4: Active Trapping (Legal Season)
- Set 10-15 snares in prime locations
- Check daily (morning and evening first week)
- Record success rate (which locations most effective?)

### Month 2+: Mastery
- Expand trap line (20-30 snares)
- Optimize placement (focus on high-success locations)
- Historical benchmark: Experienced trappers harvest 30-50% success rate (1 animal per 2-3 snares)

## Safety Warnings

### Injury Risks
- **Spring snares:** Can break fingers if triggered while setting (use safety stick)
- **Wire cuts:** Snare wire under tension can cut skin (wear gloves)
- **Deadfalls:** Heavy logs/rocks can crush hands (never reach under set deadfall)

### Legal Risks
- **Poaching charges:** Trapping without license = poaching (fines, jail time)
- **Accidental catches:** Non-target species (including pets) = potential criminal charges
- **Trespassing:** Setting traps on others' land = trespassing + poaching

### Environmental Ethics
- **Over-harvesting:** Don't trap out an area (take 20-30%, leave breeding population)
- **Breeding seasons:** Avoid trapping during denning/nesting (spring) - young starve
- **Respect ecosystem:** Predators (fox, marten) = rodent control (balance)

## Final Notes

Snares are not "primitive" - they're **efficient**. A single person with 30 snares can harvest more protein than 10 hunters with bows. The snares work while you sleep, never run out of ammunition, and require no active hunting.

In a long-term survival scenario, snares are your PRIMARY food source. Hunting is the supplement. Get good at trapping, and you'll never starve.

**Historical perspective:** Native peoples survived thousands of years primarily on trapped game. Mountain men survived Rocky Mountain winters on trapped meat. POWs survived in enemy territory by snaring rats and rabbits. The technique works. Master it.
