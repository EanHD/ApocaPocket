summary: Bass (Micropterus species) are common predatory fish in lakes, ponds, and rivers. Largemouth and smallmouth bass are both edible and fight hard on the line. Good eating but bony.
warnings:
- Bass from warm/stagnant water can taste muddy - cold, flowing water produces better flavor
- Large bass (over 5 lbs) can accumulate mercury - smaller fish are safer
- Remove lateral line (dark meat along side) to reduce strong flavor
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: LARGEMOUTH BASS: large mouth extends past eye, dark horizontal stripe along side, greenish body, 10-20 inches common. SMALLMOUTH BASS: mouth ends at eye, vertical bars on side, bronze/brown
  body. HABITAT: Largemouth in warm weedy ponds/lakes. Smallmouth in cooler rocky streams/lakes.'
- 'FIELD DRESSING: Same as trout - gut, remove gills, rinse. Bass are scalier than trout - scrape scales off or fillet to remove skin.'
- 'FILLETING: (1) Cut behind gills down to backbone. (2) Slide knife along backbone toward tail. (3) Remove rib bones. (4) Remove skin if desired. (5) Remove lateral line (dark meat).'
- 'COOKING: Fry fillets, bake, grill. Firm white meat. Cook to 145F. Mild flavor when prepared well.'
