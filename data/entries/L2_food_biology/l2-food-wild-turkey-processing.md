summary: Wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is a large game bird (10-25 lbs). Excellent eating, similar to domestic turkey but leaner. Provides substantial meat. Must be plucked or skinned, gutted, and cooked
  thoroughly.
warnings:
- Wild turkeys can carry Salmonella and other bacteria - cook to 165F internal temp
- Plucking is very time-consuming - skinning is faster but removes fat and flavor
- Harvest regulations vary - legal hunting in some areas, protected in others
- Turkeys are wary and difficult to hunt without experience
steps:
- 'FIELD DRESSING: (1) Cut around vent. (2) Cut up to breastbone. (3) Reach in, pull out internal organs. (4) Remove crop (food pouch in neck). (5) Rinse cavity. Optional: save heart, liver, gizzard (edible).'
- 'PLUCKING: Dip bird in hot water (150-160F) for 30-60 seconds. Pluck feathers (pull in direction they grow). Time-consuming. OR SKINNING: Cut skin at breast, peel back, remove entire skin. Faster but
  removes flavor and fat.'
- 'COOKING: (1) Roast whole (like domestic turkey) - stuff cavity with herbs, roast 3-4 hours at 325F. (2) Quarter and stew. (3) Breast meat can be sliced and fried. Internal temp 165F. Meat is darker and
  leaner than domestic turkey.'
- 'NUTRITION: High protein, low fat (leaner than domestic poultry). Large bird provides 10-15 lbs of meat.'
