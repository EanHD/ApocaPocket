summary: Critical reference for the most dangerous mushroom species that mimic edible

steps:
- 'DEATH CAP (Amanita phalloides): Greenish-yellow cap, white gills, skirt ring on
  stem, bulbous volva at base. Often mistaken for paddy straw mushroom. Fatal liver/kidney
  failure in 6-12 hours.'
- 'DESTROYING ANGEL (Amanita bisporigera/virosa): Pure white, elegant. White gills,
  ring, and volva. Can be mistaken for button mushroom, puffball (when young), or
  field mushroom.'
- "FALSE MOREL (Gyromitra esculenta): Brain-like wrinkled cap (not honeycomb). Interior\
  \ is NOT hollow \u2014 has chambers/cottony tissue. Contains gyromitrin (metabolizes\
  \ to monomethylhydrazine)."
- 'JACK-O-LANTERN (Omphalotus olearius): Orange, grows in clusters ON wood. True blade
  gills. Mimics chanterelle. Severe GI distress but rarely fatal.'
- 'AUTUMN SKULLCAP (Galerina marginata): Small brown mushroom on wood with ring. Mimics
  honey mushroom. Contains same toxins as death cap.'
warnings:
- "Amanita toxins have a delayed onset (6-24 hours) \u2014 victim may feel fine initially\
  \ then develop fatal organ failure."
- No folk test (silver spoon, garlic color, animal testing) is reliable.
- When in doubt, ALWAYS discard.
- Single death cap can kill an adult.

## Overview
Critical reference for the most dangerous mushroom species that mimic edible ones. Know these BEFORE foraging. When in doubt, throw it out.

## Step-by-step
1. DEATH CAP (Amanita phalloides): Greenish-yellow cap, white gills, skirt ring on stem, bulbous volva at base. Often mistaken for paddy straw mushroom. Fatal liver/kidney failure in 6-12 hours.
2. DESTROYING ANGEL (Amanita bisporigera/virosa): Pure white, elegant. White gills, ring, and volva. Can be mistaken for button mushroom, puffball (when young), or field mushroom.
3. FALSE MOREL (Gyromitra esculenta): Brain-like wrinkled cap (not honeycomb). Interior is NOT hollow — has chambers/cottony tissue. Contains gyromitrin (metabolizes to monomethylhydrazine).
4. JACK-O-LANTERN (Omphalotus olearius): Orange, grows in clusters ON wood. True blade gills. Mimics chanterelle. Severe GI distress but rarely fatal.
5. AUTUMN SKULLCAP (Galerina marginata): Small brown mushroom on wood with ring. Mimics honey mushroom. Contains same toxins as death cap.

## Warnings
- Amanita toxins have a delayed onset (6-24 hours) — victim may feel fine initially then develop fatal organ failure.
- No folk test (silver spoon, garlic color, animal testing) is reliable.
- When in doubt, ALWAYS discard.
- Single death cap can kill an adult.
