summary: Salmon (Oncorhynchus and Salmo species) are anadromous fish (spawn in freshwater, live in ocean). Return to rivers in huge runs (seasonal). Extremely high in fat and calories - one of the best
  survival fish. Pacific salmon die after spawning.
warnings:
- Spawning salmon (red coloration, hooked jaw) are edible but flesh quality declines rapidly after spawning - catch them early in run
- Raw salmon can carry parasites - freeze at -4F for 7 days or cook to 145F
- Pacific salmon species return at different times - learn local run schedules
steps:
- 'IDENTIFICATION: Large fish (12-40 inches). SPECIES (Pacific): Chinook (king) - largest, black gums. Coho (silver) - metallic blue back. Sockeye - bright red in spawning color. Pink - smallest, humpback.
  ATLANTIC SALMON: spots on back. HABITAT: Coastal rivers during spawning runs (summer-fall).'
- 'FIELD DRESSING: Same as trout but larger. Gut, remove gills. Save roe (eggs) - edible and nutritious.'
- 'SMOKING: Salmon is ideal for smoking (high fat content). See smoking entry. Smoked salmon lasts weeks.'
- 'COOKING: Grill, bake, poach, smoke. Rich, oily, flavorful. High calorie.'
- 'NUTRITION: Very high in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, vitamin D, calories (200+ cal per 4oz). One salmon provides days of food.'
