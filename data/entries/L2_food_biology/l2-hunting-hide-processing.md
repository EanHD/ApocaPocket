summary: 'Brain tanning converts raw animal hide into soft, durable buckskin leather using only the animal''s own brain. ''Every animal has enough brains to tan its own hide'' is literally true. The process
  takes 3-5 days of intermittent work. Result: soft, washable leather for clothing, bags, and moccasins.'
warnings:
- Raw hides harbor bacteria and parasites — wear gloves during fleshing. Wash hands thoroughly after handling.
- Brain tanning solution can cause eye and skin irritation — avoid splashing
- The smoking step is essential — un-smoked brain-tanned leather becomes stiff when wet and must be re-softened
- Hides left too long before processing (>24 hours in warm weather) begin to decompose — salt or freeze to preserve
steps:
- 'FLESHING: stretch hide over a smooth log or beam, flesh side up. Using a dull blade, rib bone, or dedicated fleshing tool, scrape away ALL fat, meat, and membrane from the flesh side. Every bit must
  go — remaining fat causes rot and prevents tanning solution from penetrating. This takes 1-2 hours for a deer hide.'
- 'DE-HAIRING (optional — skip for fur-on): soak hide in a lye/ash water solution (see lye entry) for 3-5 days until hair pulls out easily. Or use a ''bucking'' solution: hardwood ash water. Scrape hair
  off with a dull blade on a beam. Rinse thoroughly — residual alkali weakens the hide.'
- 'MEMBRANE REMOVAL: after de-hairing, scrape both sides again to remove the grain layer (thin, tough membrane on the outer side) and any remaining inner membrane. The hide should look and feel like thick,
  wet paper. This step is critical for softness — leaving grain makes the hide stiffer.'
- 'BRAIN SOLUTION: mix one brain (any animal brain works — deer, cow, pig) with 1 quart of warm water. Mash thoroughly into a smooth slurry. If no brain available: egg yolks (1 dozen per deer hide) or a
  mixture of soap and oil (2 tbsp soap + 3 tbsp oil per quart water).'
- 'BRAINING: wring hide until damp but not dripping. Work brain solution into every part of the hide by hand — squeeze, twist, and knead the solution in. The oils in the brain coat the collagen fibers and
  prevent them from bonding when dry (which is what makes rawhide stiff). Let soak in remaining solution overnight. Repeat braining 2-3 times for best results.'
- 'WRINGING: wring the hide as dry as possible. The traditional method: loop the hide over a stout stick, twist the stick to wring. You want to force brain solution BETWEEN the fibers, not just on the surface.'
- 'SOFTENING (the critical step): as the hide dries, you must continuously stretch and work it over a smooth stake, rope, or rounded post. Pull, stretch, and manipulate every part of the hide as it dries.
  This breaks the fiber bonds that would make it stiff. This takes 4-8 hours of intermittent work. The hide is done when it''s completely dry and uniformly soft.'
- 'If any stiff spots remain: re-wet those areas with brain solution and re-work. Every stiff spot means fibers bonded during drying.'
- 'SMOKING: sew the hide into a bag shape (or use a frame). Suspend over a small, SMOKY fire (no flame — use punk wood, rotten wood, or green wood chips). Smoke for 30-60 minutes until the hide turns a
  uniform golden-brown color. This waterproofs the hide — smoke deposits seal the fibers so the hide stays soft even when wet.'
- 'FINISHED PRODUCT: brain-tanned buckskin is soft as cloth, can be sewn into clothing, moccasins, bags, and pouches. It''s washable (hand wash, re-stretch while drying). One deer hide provides enough leather
  for a shirt or two pairs of moccasins.'

# Complete Hide Processing — Brain Tanning

Brain tanning converts raw animal hide into soft, durable buckskin leather using only the animal's own brain. 'Every animal has enough brains to tan its own hide' is literally true. The process takes 3-5 days of intermittent work. Result: soft, washable leather for clothing, bags, and moccasins.
