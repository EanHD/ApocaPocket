## Overview
Map edible species by biome and seasonal availability for collection planning.

## Step-by-step
1. Tag each species by biome and latitude band.
2. Add growth-stage cues for safe harvest windows.
3. Track nutrient density by stage when known.
4. Prioritize resilient high-yield species lists.

## Warnings
- Mis-timed harvest can increase toxicity in some species.
- Urban/roadside plants may accumulate contaminants.
