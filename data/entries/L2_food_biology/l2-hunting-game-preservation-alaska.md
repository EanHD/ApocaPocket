# Game Preservation in Alaska Wilderness

**🚨 CRITICAL WARNING**: You can starve surrounded by meat if you don't preserve it properly. In Alaska's summer, a 600 lb moose spoils in 48 hours. This killed Chris McCandless.

## Why This Matters

**Timeline of Disaster:**
- Hour 0: Kill a moose (600-1200 lbs of meat)
- Hour 2-4: **CRITICAL WINDOW** - Must start preservation NOW
- Hour 12-24: Surface spoilage begins (warm weather)
- Hour 48: Deep spoilage, meat unsafe, loss complete
- Result: Starvation with hundreds of pounds of "food" nearby

**The Chris McCandless Case Study:**
- August 1992, Stampede Trail, Alaska
- Shot a moose (~600 lbs) 
- Attempted to preserve but lacked knowledge
- Flies and warm weather (60-70°F) accelerated rot
- Lost entire kill within 2 days
- Found dead of starvation weeks later
- **Lesson**: Knowledge is as critical as the kill itself

## 🔥 Method 1: Hot Smoking (RECOMMENDED)

**Target Temperature**: 225-250°F  
**Duration**: 4-6 hours for 1-inch strips  
**Shelf Life**: 2-4 weeks unrefrigerated, 2-3 months cool/dry

### Setup Requirements

**Smoker Construction (Improvised):**
1. Fire pit (2 ft diameter, 1 ft deep)
2. Green wood frame (willow, alder) - 4 ft tall
3. Tarp or hide covering (leave 6-inch gap at top for smoke escape)
4. Metal grate or green branch lattice for hanging meat
5. Distance from fire to meat: 3-4 feet

**Wood Types (Alaska-Specific):**
- ✅ **Alder**: Sweet, mild, traditional for salmon/game (BEST)
- ✅ **Birch**: Light smoke, slightly sweet
- ✅ **Willow**: Mild, abundant
- ❌ **Spruce/Pine**: Resinous, bitter taste (avoid)
- ❌ **Treated wood**: Toxic chemicals

### Step-by-Step Protocol

**Meat Preparation (30-45 minutes):**
1. Cut meat into 1-inch thick strips (across the grain)
2. Trim all fat (fat goes rancid quickly)
3. Salt rub: 2 tablespoons per pound (sea salt, rock salt, or kosher salt)
4. Optional: Add pepper, garlic powder (if available)
5. Let cure 30 minutes while building smoker

**Smoking Process (4-6 hours):**
1. Build base fire, let burn to coals
2. Add green wood or soaked chips for smoke
3. Maintain 225-250°F (hand test: can hold 6 inches above for 4-5 seconds)
4. Hang meat strips on grate (not touching)
5. Keep smoke steady (thin blue smoke, not thick white)
6. Rotate meat every hour for even exposure
7. **Done when**: Dark mahogany color, firm texture, bendable but not brittle

**Temperature Check (No Thermometer):**
| Hand Distance | Hold Time | Approximate Temp |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| 6 inches | 2-3 seconds | 300-350°F (too hot) |
| 6 inches | 4-5 seconds | 225-250°F (perfect) |
| 6 inches | 7-8 seconds | 150-200°F (too cool) |

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Too hot**: Meat cooks instead of smokes, case-hardens (hard outside, raw inside)  
✓ **Fix**: Move meat farther from heat, reduce fire

❌ **Thick white smoke**: Creosote buildup, bitter taste  
✓ **Fix**: More airflow, use drier wood, smaller fire

❌ **Fat left on meat**: Goes rancid in days  
✓ **Fix**: Trim ALL visible fat before smoking

## 🥩 Method 2: Jerky (Air Drying)

**Duration**: 1-3 days depending on weather  
**Best Conditions**: Low humidity (<40%), warm (60-80°F), windy  
**Shelf Life**: 1-2 months unrefrigerated

### Salt Cure Method

**Ingredients (per 5 lbs meat):**
- 1/3 cup salt (non-iodized preferred)
- 2 tablespoons black pepper (optional)
- 1 tablespoon sugar (optional, helps preserve)

**Process:**
1. **Slice meat**: 1/4 inch thick, with grain (chewy) or against (tender)
2. **Salt cure**: Pack in salt, cover completely
3. **Cure time**: 12-24 hours in cool place
4. **Rinse**: Remove excess salt (brief rinse or wipe)
5. **Dry**: Hang in sun/wind or near fire (120-140°F)
6. **Test**: Bends without breaking, no moisture when squeezed
7. **Storage**: Keep dry, check daily for mold

### Drying Setup

**Natural Air Drying:**
- String through strips with clean cordage
- Hang 6+ feet high (bears, animals)
- Full sun exposure
- Good airflow
- Cover at night (dew/moisture)
- 1-3 days (check every 6 hours)

**Fire Drying:**
- Hang near fire (120-140°F)
- NOT in smoke (unless intentional)
- Faster (12-24 hours)
- Rotate every 2-3 hours

### Spoilage Check

**Safe Jerky:**
- Dark red/brown color
- Firm, leathery texture
- Bends without breaking
- No visible moisture
- No slime or stickiness
- No off odors

**THROW AWAY if:**
- Green, black, or white spots (mold)
- Slimy texture
- Sour or ammonia smell
- Excessive softness (under-dried)

## ❄️ Method 3: Cold Storage

**Target Temperature**: <40°F (ideal: 32-38°F)  
**Duration**: 5-10 days (if properly maintained)

### Snow Cache (Winter/Spring)

**Construction:**
1. Dig pit in snowbank (3-4 feet deep)
2. Line with spruce boughs (insulation + drainage)
3. Wrap meat in game bags or cloth
4. Layer snow between packages
5. Cover with 18+ inches packed snow
6. Mark location (stake, branches)
7. Cover entrance with logs (bears)

**Maintenance:**
- Check daily
- Re-pack snow if settling
- Rotate packages every 2-3 days
- Must stay below 40°F

### Stream Cooling (Summer)

**Setup:**
1. Find cold-running stream (glacier-fed ideal)
2. Wrap meat in waterproof game bags
3. Weight down with rocks (must stay submerged)
4. Secure with cordage to bank (prevent loss)
5. Check every 12 hours

**⚠️ WARNING**: Water must be <50°F and fast-moving. Slow/warm water = bacterial growth

### Underground Cache

**Best For**: Permafrost regions, cool climates

**Construction:**
1. Dig 3-4 feet down (below frost line or into cool soil)
2. Line with rocks (drainage + cooling)
3. Place meat in game bags
4. Cover with moss, then soil
5. Mark location
6. Heavy rock cap (bear-proof)

**Temperature Check:**
- Place hand in pit: should feel cold
- If warm, dig deeper or relocate

## 🦠 Spoilage Recognition (CRITICAL)

### Visual Indicators

| Stage | Appearance | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Fresh | Bright red/purple, firm | Safe to eat/preserve |
| Early spoilage | Brownish-gray edges, soft spots | Trim affected areas, preserve immediately |
| Advanced spoilage | Green/black patches, slimy film | **DISCARD ENTIRE PIECE** |
| Total loss | Putrid, liquefying | Discard all, do not touch with bare hands |

### Smell Test

- ✅ **Fresh**: Clean, slightly metallic (iron/blood)
- ✅ **Aging**: Slightly gamey, but not offensive
- ⚠️ **Questionable**: Sour, sharp, unusual
- ❌ **SPOILED**: Rotten eggs, ammonia, putrid

**Rule**: If you question the smell, don't eat it.

### Touch Test

- ✅ **Fresh**: Firm, springs back when pressed
- ⚠️ **Questionable**: Soft, leaves indentation
- ❌ **SPOILED**: Slimy, sticky, breaks apart

### Timeline by Temperature

| Temperature | Preservation Window |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 32-40°F | 7-10 days (hanging in shade) |
| 40-50°F | 3-5 days |
| 50-60°F | 24-36 hours |
| 60-70°F | 12-24 hours |
| 70°F+ | 6-12 hours |

**Alaska Summer (June-Aug)**: Assume 60-70°F, act within 12-24 hours

## ⚡ Emergency Priorities

**You've just killed a moose. What now?**

**Hour 0-2 (Immediate):**
1. Field dress completely (see l2-hunting-large-game-field-dressing)
2. Quarter meat (maximize cooling surface area)
3. Hang in shade with airflow
4. Remove hide (holds heat)

**Hour 2-4 (CRITICAL WINDOW):**
1. Decide preservation method based on resources:
   - **Have fire/wood**: Start smoking
   - **Have salt**: Start jerky cure
   - **Cold weather**: Set up snow cache or stream cooling
2. Begin cutting meat into strips/chunks
3. Start preservation process

**Hour 4-12:**
1. Continue preservation work (smoking, curing, caching)
2. Protect from flies (smoke helps, or cover with cloth)
3. Monitor temperature and spoilage signs
4. Adjust methods if needed

**Hour 12-24:**
1. Most meat should be in preservation process
2. Prioritize choice cuts (backstrap, tenderloins) if rationing effort
3. Accept losses if necessary (feed to dogs, bury to avoid bears)

## 🛡️ Bear Safety During Preservation

**Active smoking/drying attracts bears**

**Precautions:**
- Work 100+ yards from camp
- Keep firearm accessible
- Hang finished product 15 feet high, 10 feet from trees
- Move processing site daily if possible
- Do NOT preserve meat in/near sleeping area
- Store finished product in bear bags or cache

---

## 📊 Estimated Yields

| Animal | Live Weight | Meat Yield | Preservation Time (1 person) |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------------------------|
| Moose | 1000 lbs | 400-500 lbs | 3-5 days full-time work |
| Caribou | 300 lbs | 120-150 lbs | 1-2 days |
| Deer | 150 lbs | 50-75 lbs | 8-16 hours |

**Reality Check**: You may not save all the meat. Prioritize high-value cuts and accept partial loss over total loss.

## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

**Ask yourself:**

1. **What's the temperature?**
   - <40°F → Hanging + cold storage (simplest)
   - 40-60°F → Smoking or jerky (urgent)
   - 60°F+ → Smoking + jerky + accept losses (critical)

2. **What resources do I have?**
   - Fire + wood → Smoking (best)
   - Salt → Jerky
   - Neither → Cold cache (winter) or prioritize eating fresh

3. **How much meat?**
   - <50 lbs → Focus on perfection
   - 50-200 lbs → Mix methods (smoke best cuts, jerky the rest)
   - 200+ lbs → Triage (smoke/jerk what you can, cache/abandon rest)
