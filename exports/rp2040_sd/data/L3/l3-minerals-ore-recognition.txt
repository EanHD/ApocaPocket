[SUMMARY]
Field indicators for identifying iron, copper, and tin ore deposits without laboratory equipment.

[STEPS]
1. Iron: look for red-brown staining on rocks and soil (rust/hematite), heavy dark rocks with metallic luster.
2. Iron bog ore: reddish-orange deposits in swampy/marshy areas where iron precipitates from groundwater.
3. Copper: green/blue staining (malachite, azurite) on rock surfaces indicates copper mineralization.
4. Tin (cassiterite): heavy black/brown crystals in stream gravels, very high specific gravity.
5. Use streak test on unglazed porcelain: hematite streaks red-brown, magnetite streaks black.
6. Test magnetism with any iron/steel object—magnetite is strongly magnetic.

[WARNINGS]
! Some ore minerals contain toxic elements (arsenic, lead)—wash hands after handling.
! Mining and smelting operations require proper ventilation.
