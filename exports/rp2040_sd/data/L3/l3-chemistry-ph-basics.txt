[SUMMARY]
Practical pH understanding for sanitation, soil management, and process control.

[STEPS]
1. Use pH strips/meters with calibration checks.
2. Interpret pH scale logarithmically.
3. Adjust systems gradually and re-test.
4. Record pH with temperature and medium context.

[WARNINGS]
! Strong acids/bases cause severe injury.
! Do not mix unknown chemicals.
