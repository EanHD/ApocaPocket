[SUMMARY]
Potassium hydroxide (lye) from wood ash is essential for soap making, food processing (nixtamalization), and leather tanning. Hardwood ash produces the strongest lye. A simple leaching setup produces usable lye in 24-48 hours.

[STEPS]
1. WOOD SELECTION: hardwood ash produces the best lye. Best (highest potash): hickory, oak, ash, beech, maple, apple. Avoid softwood (pine, spruce, fir) — low potash content and resin contaminates the lye. Burn wood completely to white/gray ash — black charcoal bits are useless.
2. LEACHING VESSEL: drill/punch small holes in the bottom of a wooden barrel, bucket, or large can. Line bottom with 2-3 inches of straw, grass, or small sticks (this is a filter to keep ash from washing through).
3. PACK AND LEACH: fill vessel with hardwood ash, pressing down firmly. Pour rainwater (soft water — NOT hard water) slowly over the top. Collect liquid dripping from the bottom into a glass, ceramic, or wooden container. The first run-through will be weak — pour it back over the ash 2-3 times.
4. STRENGTH TEST — EGG FLOAT: place a raw egg in the collected lye water. If the egg floats with a quarter-sized area above the surface, the lye is strong enough for soap making (~pH 13). If the egg sinks, the lye is too weak — pass through fresh ash or reduce by boiling.
5. STRENGTH TEST — FEATHER: dip a chicken feather in the lye. If it dissolves the barbs within a few minutes, the lye is strong. If not, concentrate further.
6. CONCENTRATION: if lye is weak, simmer gently in a non-aluminum pot (iron or stainless steel) to evaporate water. Do this OUTDOORS — lye fumes irritate lungs. Reduce volume by half to roughly double concentration.
7. SOLID POTASH: for dry potash (potassium carbonate), continue boiling lye water until all water evaporates. The white/gray residue is potash — store in airtight container away from moisture. Potash absorbs water from air (hygroscopic).
8. YIELD: approximately 5 gallons of ash produces 1-2 gallons of usable lye water, or 1-2 cups of dry potash. One cord of hardwood burned produces enough ash for several batches.
9. USES: soap making (lye + animal fat/oil), nixtamalization (soaking corn in lye water makes niacin bioavailable — prevents pellagra), glass making (potash + sand), fertilizer (potash is potassium — essential plant nutrient), leather tanning (dehairing hides).
10. STORAGE: lye water stores for months in sealed non-aluminum containers. Dry potash stores indefinitely if kept bone-dry. Label clearly as POISON/CAUSTIC.

[WARNINGS]
! Lye is EXTREMELY caustic — causes severe chemical burns on skin contact and blindness if it enters eyes
! NEVER use aluminum containers for lye — it reacts violently, producing flammable hydrogen gas
! Keep lye away from children and animals — ingestion is fatal
! Use wooden, glass, ceramic, or stainless steel containers ONLY
! Wear eye protection and gloves if available. If lye contacts skin, flush with large amounts of water immediately
