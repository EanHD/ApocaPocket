[SUMMARY]
Evaluating sand and gravel deposits for suitability in construction, mortar, and filtration.

[STEPS]
1. Source from river beds, glacial deposits, and eroded hillsides.
2. Good construction sand is angular (sharp), not rounded—angular grains interlock better.
3. Avoid sand with high clay or organic content—rub between fingers, it should feel gritty not slippery.
4. Wash sand: stir in water, let settle, pour off muddy water. Repeat until water runs clear.
5. Grade gravel by size: pass through improvised screens for uniform aggregate.
6. Mix ratios for basic mortar: roughly 1 part lime/cement to 3 parts sand by volume.
