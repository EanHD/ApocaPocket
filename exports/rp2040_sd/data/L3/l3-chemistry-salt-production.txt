[SUMMARY]
Methods for producing salt at scale through solar evaporation, boiling brine, and mining surface deposits.

[STEPS]
1. Solar evaporation: create shallow clay-lined pans, fill with seawater or brine, let sun evaporate.
2. Boiling: heat brine in wide metal or clay pans over sustained fire until crystals form.
3. Scrape salt crystals, re-dissolve in clean water, filter through cloth, re-crystallize for purity.
4. Rock salt: mine visible salt deposits, crush, dissolve, filter, and recrystallize.
5. Salt from inland plants: burn salt-tolerant plants, leach ash with water, evaporate to recover salt.
6. Store in dry, sealed containers. Salt is essential for food preservation, leather tanning, and health.

[WARNINGS]
! Boiling brine produces hot steam and splashing—use eye protection and caution.
! Concentrated brine is corrosive to metal containers—use clay, glass, or stainless steel when possible.
