[SUMMARY]
Building and operating a simple distillation apparatus to purify water or separate liquids.

[STEPS]
1. Basic setup: heat contaminated water in a closed vessel, route steam through a tube to a cooled collection vessel.
2. Improvised condenser: run steam tube through a container of cold water to promote condensation.
3. Solar still: dig a pit, place container at center, cover with clear plastic, weight center—condensation drips into container.
4. Distillation removes dissolved solids, many chemicals, and kills pathogens.
5. First and last portions of distillate may contain concentrated impurities—discard.
6. Solar stills produce small quantities (~0.5–1L/day)—supplement with other methods.

[WARNINGS]
! Distillation may not remove all volatile organic compounds.
! Steam causes severe burns—handle apparatus carefully.
! Distilling alcohol is a separate skill with additional hazards.
