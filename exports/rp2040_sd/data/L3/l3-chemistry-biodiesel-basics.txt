[SUMMARY]
Transesterification converts vegetable oil into biodiesel that runs in diesel engines. Requires methanol, lye, and a settling period. 10 gallons of oil yields ~9 gallons of biodiesel plus glycerin byproduct.

[STEPS]
1. Heat oil to 55°C
2. Mix methanol (20% by volume) with lye (0.3-0.5% by weight)
3. Combine and stir vigorously for 60 minutes
4. Let settle 8-12 hours — glycerin sinks, biodiesel floats
5. Drain glycerin from bottom
6. Wash biodiesel with water to remove residual impurities
7. Dry and filter
8. Use in any diesel engine without modification (B100) or blend with petroleum diesel

[WARNINGS]
! Methanol is toxic and flammable
! Lye causes severe chemical burns
! Biodiesel damages rubber — replace rubber fuel lines
! Glycerin byproduct is useful (soap making) but must be handled properly
