[SUMMARY]
Basic methods for tanning animal hides into durable leather using natural tannins or brain tanning.

[STEPS]
1. Flesh the hide: scrape all meat and fat from the skin side using a dull blade.
2. Remove hair: soak in wood ash lye solution for 3–7 days, then scrape hair off.
3. Rinse thoroughly to remove all lye.
4. Bark tanning: soak in solution of crushed oak/hemlock bark and water for weeks to months.
5. Brain tanning: mash animal brain with warm water, work into hide, stretch and smoke over fire.
6. Smoking: hang brain-tanned hide over smoky fire (punk wood) for hours—makes it water-resistant.
7. Work the hide while drying—pull and stretch repeatedly for soft, supple leather.

[WARNINGS]
! Lye solution for dehairing causes chemical burns—handle with protection.
! Rotting hides produce extremely foul odors and attract pests—work downwind of camp.
! Brain-tanning requires patience; rushing produces stiff, unusable leather.
