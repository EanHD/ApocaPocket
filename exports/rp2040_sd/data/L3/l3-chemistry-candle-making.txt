[SUMMARY]
Candles provide reliable light without electricity. Tallow (rendered animal fat) is the most available material; beeswax produces superior candles. A single tallow candle burns 4-6 hours and provides enough light to read by.

[STEPS]
1. RENDERING TALLOW: cut animal fat (beef, deer, sheep — kidney/suet fat is best) into small cubes or grind. Add to pot with ½ cup water per pound of fat. Heat on LOW — never boil. Stir occasionally for 2-4 hours until all solid pieces have liquefied or become crispy.
2. Strain through cloth into a clean container. Let cool and solidify. Scrape off any brown/meat residue from the bottom. For cleaner candles, remelt and strain again. Triple-rendered tallow is white and nearly odorless.
3. WICKS: twist cotton string/thread tightly (3 strands twisted together). For better burn, soak wick in solution of 1 tablespoon salt + 2 tablespoons borax per cup of water, then dry. This makes the wick self-trimming and reduces smoking.
4. DIP CANDLES: melt tallow to 60-70°C. Tie wick to a stick. Dip wick into tallow, lift out, let cool 30 seconds. Repeat 20-40 times, building up layers. Each dip adds ~1mm thickness. A ¾-inch candle takes about 25-30 dips.
5. MOLD CANDLES: pour melted tallow into any cylindrical mold (tin can, bamboo tube, PVC pipe, rolled bark). Thread wick through center — poke hole in bottom of mold, thread wick through, seal with clay/wax. Pour in layers, letting each partially cool to prevent sinkholes.
6. BEESWAX CANDLES: melt beeswax at 62-65°C (lower than tallow). Same dipping or molding process. Beeswax burns brighter, longer, and cleaner than tallow. Mix with tallow 50/50 for economy.
7. RUSH LIGHTS (simplest option): peel the outer skin from dry rushes/cattail stalks, leaving one strip of skin for structure. Soak the pith in melted tallow for 30 minutes. Dry. Clamp at 45° angle in a holder. Burns 15-30 minutes per foot of rush.
8. BURN TIME: tallow candle (¾ inch diameter, 6 inch tall) = 4-6 hours. Beeswax same size = 6-8 hours. One pound of tallow makes approximately 4 standard candles.

[WARNINGS]
! Hot rendered fat causes severe burns — handle with extreme care, especially around children
! Tallow candles produce smoke and odor — ensure ventilation
! Never leave candles unattended — fire risk is significant, especially in improvised shelters
! Rendering fat produces strong odors — do it outdoors
