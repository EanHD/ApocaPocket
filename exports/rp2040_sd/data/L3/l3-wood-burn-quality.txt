[SUMMARY]
Fuel selection by moisture, density, and desired heat curve.

[STEPS]
1. Separate tinder/kindling/fuel logs by diameter.
2. Prefer seasoned wood for stable combustion.
3. Blend fast and slow-burning species.
4. Ventilate combustion area to reduce smoke/CO.

[WARNINGS]
! Green wood increases smoke and creosote.
! Indoor combustion without ventilation is dangerous.
