[SUMMARY]
Field methods for identifying wood species by bark, leaf, grain, and growth characteristics.

[STEPS]
1. Examine bark texture: smooth, furrowed, plated, or peeling.
2. Check leaf shape: needle vs broadleaf, simple vs compound, alternate vs opposite.
3. Cut a cross-section to observe growth rings, heartwood color, and grain pattern.
4. Smell fresh-cut wood—many species have distinctive odors (cedar, pine, walnut).
5. Test hardness by pressing a thumbnail into end grain.
6. Cross-reference bark + leaf + grain to narrow species identification.
