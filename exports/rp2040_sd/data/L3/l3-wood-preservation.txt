[SUMMARY]
Natural and improvised methods to prevent wood rot, insect damage, and decay.

[STEPS]
1. Keep wood dry—moisture below 20% prevents most fungal rot.
2. Elevate wood structures off ground contact using stone or concrete footings.
3. Char the surface of ground-contact posts (shou sugi ban / yakisugi technique).
4. Apply natural oils (linseed, tung) to seal surfaces against moisture.
5. Use naturally rot-resistant species: cedar, black locust, white oak, osage orange.
6. Ensure good ventilation around wood structures to prevent moisture accumulation.

[WARNINGS]
! Chemical wood preservatives (CCA, creosote) are toxic—avoid for food contact surfaces.
! Burning surfaces requires careful fire control.
