[SUMMARY]
Recognizing iron deposits in the field. Magnetite and hematite are the primary ores. Limonite and bog iron are easier to smelt but lower grade. Surface indicators help locate workable deposits for primitive iron production.

[STEPS]
1. MAGNETITE (Fe3O4): black metallic mineral, strongly magnetic (attracts compass, can be picked up with a magnet). Often found in beach/stream sands as black sand concentrations. Highest grade iron ore (72% iron content).
2. HEMATITE (Fe2O3): red to gray mineral, leaves a red-brown streak on unglazed porcelain or stone. Found in sedimentary layers and as 'kidney ore' (rounded nodules). 70% iron content.
3. LIMONITE: yellow-brown rusty deposits. Found near surface as bog iron (in wetlands, streams) or as a weathering product of other ores. Lower grade (50-60%) but easier to smelt due to lower melting point.
4. BOG IRON: orange-brown nodules or crusts in swamps, stream beds, and spring areas. Forms where groundwater deposits dissolved iron. Vikings smelted bog iron extensively. Can be harvested sustainably (reforms over years).
5. SURFACE INDICATORS: red soil (laterite), rust-stained rocks near springs, magnetic anomalies, heavy black sand concentrations in streams.
6. TESTING: streak test (hematite = red-brown, magnetite = black), magnet test, density (iron ores are heavy — sink in water, much heavier than most rocks).
7. Economically workable deposits need: surface access, nearby fuel source (wood for charcoal), limestone for flux, and water. Primitive iron production is extremely labor and fuel-intensive.

[WARNINGS]
! Iron ore alone is useless — you also need charcoal, flux (limestone), and a blast furnace capable of 1200°C+
! Most visible iron ore is low grade — bloomery yields 10-30% metallic iron from ore by weight
! Deep mining is extremely dangerous — only surface and shallow deposits are practical in survival
! Modern steel is alloyed — primitive bloomery iron is soft and needs repeated heating and hammering to improve
