[SUMMARY]
Basic field tests for identifying workable clay deposits.

[STEPS]
1. Collect subsoil sample away from organic top layer.
2. Perform ribbon/plasticity tests with water.
3. Settle slurry to estimate silt/sand proportion.
4. Test small fired sample for shrinkage/cracking.

[WARNINGS]
! Natural clays may contain contaminants.
! Firing requires controlled ventilation and heat management.
