[SUMMARY]
Identifying limestone and its wide applications from mortar to soil amendment to water treatment.

[STEPS]
1. Identify limestone: reacts with acid (vinegar fizzes on surface), usually gray/white, soft (hardness 3).
2. Agricultural use: crushed limestone raises soil pH for acid soils.
3. Burn limestone at 900°C+ to produce quicklime (calcium oxide) for mortar and plaster.
4. Slake quicklime with water to produce calcium hydroxide for whitewash and mortar.
5. Limestone gravel serves as construction aggregate and drainage material.
6. Powdered limestone can clarify water by precipitating impurities.

[WARNINGS]
! Quicklime reacts violently with water—generates extreme heat and can cause burns.
! Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) is caustic—avoid skin and eye contact.
