[SUMMARY]
Producing natural adhesives from animal hides, tree resins, and plant materials.

[STEPS]
1. Pine pitch glue: collect resin from conifer wounds, melt gently, mix with crushed charcoal (~30%) and plant fiber.
2. Hide glue: simmer rawhide scraps or sinew in water for hours until liquid becomes syrupy.
3. Birch bark tar: heat birch bark in sealed container (no oxygen) to extract dark, sticky tar.
4. Apply adhesives warm—most natural glues set as they cool and dry.
5. Pine pitch is waterproof; hide glue is stronger but water-soluble.
6. Store hide glue dried; reconstitute by soaking in warm water.

[WARNINGS]
! Heating resin produces flammable vapors—use small fires, avoid open flames directly over resin.
! Birch tar extraction requires controlled pyrolysis—fire risk.
