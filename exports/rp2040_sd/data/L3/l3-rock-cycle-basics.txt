[SUMMARY]
Rock classification framework for practical material use and terrain interpretation.

[STEPS]
1. Assess grain size, layering, and crystal structure.
2. Classify by formation process indicators.
3. Infer durability and weathering tendency.
4. Map local availability for construction/tool use.

[WARNINGS]
! Mixed or altered samples may blur class boundaries.
! Avoid unstable slopes and fresh fracture zones.
