[SUMMARY]
Producing quicklime (CaO) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)₂) from limestone for mortar, plaster, and sanitation.

[STEPS]
1. Gather limestone or seashells (both are calcium carbonate).
2. Build a lime kiln: stack limestone over a fire chamber that can sustain 900°C+ for hours.
3. Burn for 12–24 hours until stones become white, lighter, and crumbly—this is quicklime (CaO).
4. Slaking: carefully add water to quicklime—it heats violently and produces calcium hydroxide paste.
5. Lime putty (aged slaked lime) makes superior mortar and plaster.
6. Mix with sand (~1:3 ratio) for mortar; use thin coats for plaster/whitewash.

[WARNINGS]
! Quicklime reacts violently with water—extreme heat, steam, and caustic splashing.
! Both quicklime and slaked lime cause severe burns—full skin and eye protection required.
! Lime kiln operation requires sustained high temperatures—significant fire risk.
