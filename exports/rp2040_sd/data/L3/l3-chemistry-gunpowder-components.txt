[SUMMARY]
Educational overview of the three gunpowder components—saltpeter (potassium nitrate), sulfur, and charcoal—and how to identify them in nature.

[STEPS]
1. Saltpeter (KNO₃): forms as white crystalline crust in caves, stables, and manure-rich soil.
2. Test saltpeter: dissolves in water, placed on charcoal ember it causes vigorous burning/sparking.
3. Sulfur: found near volcanic vents and hot springs as bright yellow crystalline deposits.
4. Test sulfur: burns with blue flame and produces sharp SO₂ smell (rotten eggs when impure).
5. Charcoal: produced from wood pyrolysis (see charcoal production entry).
6. Historical ratio: ~75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur by weight.
7. This entry is for IDENTIFICATION and CHEMISTRY EDUCATION only.

[WARNINGS]
! ⚠ EDUCATIONAL REFERENCE ONLY — not manufacturing instructions.
! Gunpowder is explosive and extremely dangerous to produce, handle, and store.
! Sulfur dioxide fumes are toxic—never burn sulfur in enclosed spaces.
! Manufacturing explosives may be illegal in your jurisdiction.
