[SUMMARY]
Primary non-destructive tests for field mineral identification.

[STEPS]
1. Record color/luster and host rock context.
2. Test Mohs hardness against reference points.
3. Perform streak test on unglazed ceramic.
4. Check fracture/cleavage patterns.

[WARNINGS]
! Weathering can obscure true surface traits.
! Field ID is probabilistic without lab confirmation.
