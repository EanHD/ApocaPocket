[SUMMARY]
Foundational combustion chemistry for fire control, fuel efficiency, and hazard reduction.

[STEPS]
1. Model fire triangle: fuel, oxygen, heat.
2. Adjust airflow and fuel geometry to control burn.
3. Track incomplete combustion indicators.
4. Apply extinguishing strategy by removing one fire-triangle element.

[WARNINGS]
! Combustion byproducts include toxic gases.
! Confined spaces dramatically increase risk.
