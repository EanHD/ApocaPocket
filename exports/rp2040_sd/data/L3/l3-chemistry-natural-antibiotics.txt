[SUMMARY]
Natural compounds with documented antimicrobial activity. NOT substitutes for antibiotics when available, but useful when pharmaceutical antibiotics are unavailable.

[STEPS]
1. HONEY (topical only): manuka honey (MGO 400+) or raw local honey applied to wounds. Change dressing daily. Effective against staph, strep, E.coli.
2. RAW GARLIC: crush 2-3 cloves, let sit 10 min (activates allicin), consume raw. Repeat 3× daily. Broad-spectrum but destroyed by cooking.
3. OREGANO OIL: 2-3 drops under tongue 2× daily OR dilute in carrier oil for topical. Contains carvacrol (antimicrobial compound).
4. COLLOIDAL SILVER (controversial): 10-20 ppm solution, 1 tsp 3× daily. ONLY short-term use (<2 weeks). Overuse causes permanent discoloration.
5. TEA TREE OIL: topical only (toxic if ingested). 5-10% dilution for wound treatment.
6. These are adjuncts — always combine with proper wound care, drainage, and clean dressing changes

[WARNINGS]
! These are NOT equivalent to pharmaceutical antibiotics
! Serious infections (sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia) require evacuation even when using natural antimicrobials
! Colloidal silver overuse causes argyria (permanent blue-gray skin discoloration)
! None of these are effective against all bacteria
