[SUMMARY]
Glass is melted silica (sand) + flux (soda ash or potash) + stabilizer (lime). Requires 1400-1600°C sustained temperature. Primitive glass (bottle green, full of bubbles) is achievable with a forced-air furnace and local materials.

[STEPS]
1. MATERIALS: clean silica sand (white beach sand or crushed quartz), soda ash or potash (from wood ash — see lye entry), and lime (from limestone). Ratio: 70% sand, 15% flux, 15% lime by weight.
2. Build a high-temperature furnace: clay-lined pit with forced air (bellows or blower). Charcoal fuel. Target temperature: 1400°C+. A pottery kiln capable of stoneware temperatures can work.
3. Mix ingredients thoroughly when DRY. Place in a crucible (clay pot rated for high heat).
4. Heat gradually over 2-4 hours to avoid thermal shock cracking the crucible. Maintain peak temperature for 1-2 hours until mixture is completely molten and homogeneous.
5. Pour into molds or roll on a flat surface (marver). Work quickly — glass stiffens as it cools.
6. Anneal (slow cool) over 12-24 hours to prevent stress cracks. Rapid cooling shatters glass.
7. Expect green tint (from iron impurities in sand) and bubbles (dissolved gases). Refined glass requires purer ingredients and skilled technique.
8. USES: bottles, jars, windows (cast and ground flat), beads, tools for working other materials

[WARNINGS]
! Glass melting requires extreme temperatures — severe burn risk
! Silica dust (from grinding sand) causes silicosis — work wet or wear mask
! Molten glass looks identical to solid glass — assume everything near the furnace is dangerously hot
! Early attempts produce brittle, bubbly, colored glass — functional but not optical quality
