[SUMMARY]
Basic fermentation science for producing alcohol (ethanol) and vinegar (acetic acid) from sugars.

[STEPS]
1. Source sugars: fruit juice, honey-water (mead), grain mash (beer), or sugar-water.
2. Wild yeast: expose sugar solution to air for 24h or add unwashed fruit skins.
3. Seal in container with airlock (water trap) to allow CO₂ out but prevent oxygen entry.
4. Ferment at 18–24°C for 1–4 weeks until bubbling stops.
5. For vinegar: expose finished alcohol to air—acetobacter bacteria convert ethanol to acetic acid over weeks.
6. Test vinegar by taste (sour) and smell; ~4–5% acidity is usable for preservation.

[WARNINGS]
! Methanol (toxic) can form in improperly distilled spirits—fermented beverages are safe, distilled ones require care.
! Contamination with harmful bacteria is possible—maintain cleanliness and proper acidity.
