[SUMMARY]
Load-bearing capacity, span guidelines, and structural selection for wood in building.

[STEPS]
1. Understand that strength varies by species, moisture content, and grain direction.
2. Use hardwoods (oak, maple) for load-bearing posts and beams.
3. Use softwoods (pine, spruce, fir) for framing where weight matters.
4. Rule of thumb: beam depth (inches) ≈ span (feet) for moderate residential loads.
5. Always load wood in compression parallel to grain for maximum strength.
6. Avoid using wood with large knots, splits, or spiral grain in structural applications.
7. Green wood is weaker—allow seasoning before structural use.

[WARNINGS]
! Overloaded wood members can fail suddenly without warning.
! Verify local species properties—strength varies dramatically between species.
