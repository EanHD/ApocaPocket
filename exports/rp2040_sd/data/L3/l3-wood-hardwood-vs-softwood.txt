[SUMMARY]
Mechanical and practical distinctions between hardwood and softwood families.

[STEPS]
1. Identify species group and growth characteristics.
2. Compare density and moisture behavior.
3. Match wood type to load/tool/fire use.
4. Track seasoning and storage effects.

[WARNINGS]
! Species-level properties vary widely within each class.
! Wet wood performance and burn quality degrade sharply.
