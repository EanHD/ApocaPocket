[SUMMARY]
Methods for drying and curing wood to reduce moisture content for construction and fuel use.

[STEPS]
1. Assess green wood moisture content by weight or cracking indicators.
2. Split wood to increase surface area for faster drying.
3. Stack in criss-cross pattern (stickered) with airflow gaps, elevated off ground.
4. Cover top to shed rain while leaving sides open for ventilation.
5. Air-dry hardwoods 6–12 months, softwoods 3–6 months depending on thickness.
6. Test readiness: seasoned wood is lighter, sounds hollow when struck, has end-grain cracks.

[WARNINGS]
! Unseasoned wood burns inefficiently and produces excessive creosote.
! Kiln drying in improvised setups risks fire—monitor temperature carefully.
