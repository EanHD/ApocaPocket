[SUMMARY]
Producing and using activated charcoal for water and air filtration.

[STEPS]
1. Start with high-quality hardwood charcoal (see charcoal production entry).
2. Crush charcoal into small granules (pea-sized or smaller).
3. Improvised activation: soak crushed charcoal in calcium chloride or lemon juice solution for 24h, then reheat.
4. Even non-activated charcoal effectively adsorbs many contaminants—use it if activation is not possible.
5. Build filter: layer gravel, sand, then charcoal in a container with drainage hole.
6. Pass water through slowly—contact time improves adsorption.
7. Replace charcoal when water taste/odor returns (typically every few weeks of use).

[WARNINGS]
! Charcoal filtration does NOT reliably remove all pathogens—still boil or disinfect filtered water.
! Activated charcoal dust is an irritant—avoid inhaling.
