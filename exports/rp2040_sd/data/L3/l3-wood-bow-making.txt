[SUMMARY]
A properly made wooden bow is an effective hunting and defense tool. Best woods: yew, osage orange, black locust, hickory, elm, ash, maple. A simple flatbow can be made in 1-2 days from a seasoned stave.

[STEPS]
1. WOOD SELECTION: ideal stave is a straight branch or split log, 60-68 inches long, 2 inches wide, free of knots and twists on the back (outer side). Top choices: osage orange, yew, hickory, black locust. Acceptable: ash, elm, maple, oak (red oak is poor). The back of the bow (facing target) should be a single unbroken growth ring.
2. SPLIT OR SAW the stave from a log section 5-6 inches in diameter. Split in half, then quarters. Each quarter can become a bow. The back of the bow follows the outer ring of the tree — NEVER cut into this surface.
3. ROUGH SHAPE: the handle (center 4 inches) is 1.5 inches wide and full thickness. The limbs taper gradually from handle to tips — 1.5 inches wide at handle, tapering to ¾ inch at tips. Leave the belly (inner side, facing you) thick for now.
4. TILLERING: the art of removing wood from the belly so both limbs bend evenly. Place the bow on a stick ('tillering stick') with notches at intervals. Pull the string to increasing draw lengths: 6 inches, 12 inches, 18 inches, checking bend after each. Remove wood (scraping with knife or glass) from stiff spots on the belly. Both limbs must bend in a smooth arc.
5. Target draw weight for hunting: 40-50 lbs at 28-inch draw. For a 66-inch flatbow, leave limbs 1.5 inches wide and ~¾ inch thick at the handle, tapering to ½ inch thick near tips. Measure draw weight by hanging known weights.
6. CUT STRING NOCKS: small grooves ½ inch from each tip, angled to hold the string. Do not cut into the back — only the sides and belly.
7. STRING: twisted plant fiber (linen, dogbane, nettle, sinew) or paracord. Bow string should be 3-4 inches shorter than the bow. Brace height (string to handle distance) should be 6-7 inches for a flatbow.
8. ARROWS: straight shoots of dogwood, viburnum, willow, or bamboo, 28-30 inches long, pencil-thick. Straighten over heat. Fletch with feathers (split feather, 3 per arrow, glued/tied with sinew). Point: sharpened hardwood, knapped stone, or filed metal.
9. FINISHING: rub bow belly and back with animal fat or oil to prevent moisture gain/loss. Store bow unstrung. Re-tiller if one limb develops more bend over time.
10. A well-made wooden bow can last 1-3 years with care. Expect 100-300+ shots before significant set develops.

[WARNINGS]
! A breaking bow stave can send sharp splinters into eyes and face — always wear eye protection or keep face to the side when tillering
! Never dry-fire a bow (release string without arrow) — this can shatter the bow violently
! A survival bow will be less powerful than a commercial bow — effective range is 15-25 yards for hunting
! Green (unseasoned) wood bows take excessive set quickly and lose power. Allow to season 1-4 weeks if possible.
