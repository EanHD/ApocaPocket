[SUMMARY]
Peppery aquatic green found in clean streams and springs. Highly nutritious but carries liver fluke risk if eaten raw from contaminated water.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by compound leaves with rounded leaflets, hollow stems, small white four-petaled flowers, growing in flowing water.
2. Harvest from clean, flowing water sources above any livestock grazing.
3. Cook to eliminate liver fluke (Fasciola) risk if source is uncertain.
4. Excellent in soups, stir-fries, or blanched.

[WARNINGS]
! LIVER FLUKE RISK from contaminated water — cook if water source has livestock upstream.
! Fool's watercress (Apium nodiflorum) is similar but also edible. Hemlock water dropwort is DEADLY — confirm hollow stem and leaf shape carefully.
