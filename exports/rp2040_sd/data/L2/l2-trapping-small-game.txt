[STEPS]
1. Identify game trails, runs, and feeding areas through tracks and sign.
2. Simple snare: running noose of wire/cord at head height of target animal on a known trail.
3. Deadfall: figure-4 trigger with weighted rock/log over bait platform.
4. Funnel trap: guide fences narrowing to a box or enclosure.
5. Set multiple traps (10+) — success rate per trap is low. Check twice daily.
