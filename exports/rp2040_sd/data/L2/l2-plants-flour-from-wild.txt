[SUMMARY]
Wild flour sources provide critical carbohydrates for long-term survival. Acorns are the highest-yield wild food in temperate forests (one tree produces 70-150 lbs/year). All require processing to remove toxins or improve digestibility.

[STEPS]
1. ACORN FLOUR — Collection: gather in fall when they drop. Prefer white oak group (round-tipped leaves): white oak, chestnut oak, bur oak. These have less tannin than red oak group. Shell by cracking with a rock on a flat stone. Discard any with worm holes or mold.
2. ACORN FLOUR — Cold water leaching: crush shelled acorns coarsely. Place in a mesh bag or cloth in a flowing stream for 3-7 days, or change water in a container every 12 hours for 5-10 days. Taste test: should be mild/nutty with NO bitterness.
3. ACORN FLOUR — Hot water leaching (faster): boil crushed acorns in water. When water turns brown, drain and replace with FRESH boiling water. Repeat 5-10 times until water stays clear and taste is mild. IMPORTANT: always replace with boiling water — adding cold water locks in tannins.
4. ACORN FLOUR — Drying and grinding: spread leached acorn meal on flat rocks or cloth in sun. Dry completely (2-3 days sun, or near fire). Grind dried meal between stones using circular motion. Sift through cloth to remove large pieces. Regrind. Yield: ~1 lb flour per 2 lbs shelled acorns.
5. CATTAIL FLOUR — Rhizome: harvest cattail roots (rhizomes) year-round but best in fall/winter. Wash, peel outer layer. Crush in water — starch settles to bottom. Pour off water and fiber. Dry the white starch. Yield: ~100g starch per kg of rhizome. Bland, excellent thickener.
6. CATTAIL FLOUR — Pollen: in early summer, shake male flower heads into a bag. Bright yellow pollen is 50% carbohydrate. Mix 1:1 with other flour or use as nutritional supplement. ~1 tablespoon per flower head.
7. AMARANTH FLOUR: harvest seed heads when they turn brown/dry (late summer). Shake/rub seeds out onto cloth. Winnow by pouring between containers in a breeze to remove chaff. Parch seeds in dry pan until they pop (like tiny popcorn). Grind parched seeds. High protein (14-16%), complete amino acid profile.
8. GRASS SEED FLOUR: many common grasses produce edible seeds. Collect mature seed heads, thresh by rubbing between hands, winnow, and grind. Low yield per plant but grasses are everywhere. Best species: wild rice, foxtail, panic grass.
9. STORAGE: wild flour spoils faster than commercial flour due to higher oil content (especially acorn). Store in airtight container in coolest location available. Acorn flour: 2-4 weeks at room temp, months if kept cold and dry. Cattail starch: months if fully dry.
10. USING WILD FLOUR: acorn flour makes dense, nutty flatbread. Mix with water to thick paste, cook on hot stone near fire. Cattail starch thickens soups and stews. Amaranth makes porridge or flatbread. All can be mixed 50/50 with wheat flour if available.

[WARNINGS]
! RAW ACORNS ARE TOXIC — tannins cause kidney damage, nausea, and severe GI distress. They MUST be leached before eating
! Do not use acorns from red oak group without EXTENSIVE leaching (2-3x more than white oak group)
! Grinding with rocks produces grit that wears down teeth — use the finest grinding surface available and sift thoroughly
! Moldy acorns (black spots, mushy texture, ammonia smell) must be discarded — aflatoxin is carcinogenic
