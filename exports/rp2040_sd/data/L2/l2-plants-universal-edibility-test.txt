[SUMMARY]
The Universal Edibility Test is a systematic 8-hour protocol for determining if an unknown plant part is safe to eat. Each body part is tested separately — leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and seeds may have different toxicity levels.

[STEPS]
1. PREPARATION (Hour 0): Fast for 8 hours before starting the test. Separate the plant into parts: leaves, stems, roots, flowers, seeds, bark. You will test each part individually. Start with the part that is most abundant.
2. CONTACT TEST (Hour 0, 15 min): Crush the plant part and rub it on your inner wrist. Wait 15 minutes. If redness, burning, itching, or rash develops → discard this part, test a different part.
3. LIP TEST (Hour 0:15, 15 min): Touch the plant part to the corner of your lip. Wait 15 minutes. Watch for burning, tingling, numbness, or swelling.
4. TONGUE TEST (Hour 0:30, 15 min): Place a small piece on your tongue. Do NOT chew. Hold for 15 minutes. If burning, extreme bitterness, soapy taste, or numbing → spit out, rinse mouth, abandon this part.
5. CHEW TEST (Hour 0:45, 15 min): Chew a small piece thoroughly but do NOT swallow. Hold the chewed material in your mouth for 15 minutes. Same reaction criteria as above.
6. SWALLOW TEST (Hour 1): Swallow the small chewed portion. Wait 8 HOURS. Eat nothing else. Monitor for nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, dizziness, or any abnormal symptoms.
7. SMALL MEAL TEST (Hour 9): If no reaction after 8 hours, eat a small handful (¼ cup) of the prepared plant part. Wait another 8 hours monitoring for symptoms.
8. SAFE TO EAT (Hour 17+): If no reaction after the small meal, this specific plant part, prepared this specific way, is likely safe to eat. Cooked and raw may differ in toxicity — test each preparation method separately.
9. IMPORTANT: many toxic plants cause DELAYED symptoms (6-48 hours). The 8-hour waits are minimum — longer is safer. Keep a written log of what you tested and results.
10. SHORTCUT PLANTS (skip test — globally recognized as safe): dandelion (all parts), cattail (all parts), clover, wood sorrel, plantain broadleaf, chickweed. Learning to identify these 6 plants is more valuable than the edibility test.

[WARNINGS]
! NEVER test mushrooms or fungi with this protocol — many deadly mushrooms taste pleasant and symptoms appear 6-24 hours later when liver damage is already fatal
! Test ONLY ONE plant part at a time — a plant with edible leaves may have toxic roots
! Skip testing if you recognize the plant as belonging to known toxic families: white/yellow berries, umbrella-shaped flower clusters (parsley family — many are deadly), milky sap (except dandelion), almond scent in leaves/bark
! Do NOT eat anything during the 8-hour test period except the test plant — you need to isolate reactions
! If any reaction occurs at ANY stage, stop immediately, induce vomiting if within 30 minutes of ingestion, and drink plenty of water
