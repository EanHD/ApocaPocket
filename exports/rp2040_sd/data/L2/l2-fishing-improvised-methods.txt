[SUMMARY]
Methods for catching fish with minimal or improvised equipment — hooks from bone/thorns/wire, line from plant fiber or paracord, and passive trap designs.

[STEPS]
1. Fashion hooks from safety pins, thorns, bone splinters, wire, or carved hardwood (gorge hooks).
2. Use paracord inner strands, braided plant fibers, or dental floss as line.
3. Bait with insects, worms, berries, or small meat scraps.
4. Build passive traps: funnel traps from woven sticks in streams, trotlines across pools.
5. Set lines at dawn/dusk for best results.

[WARNINGS]
! Check local regulations where law still applies.
! Improvised hooks are fragile — set multiple lines.
! Avoid consuming fish from visibly polluted water.
