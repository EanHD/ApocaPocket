[SUMMARY]
Field recognition of common nutritional deficiencies that develop over weeks to months of restricted diet. Early detection enables targeted foraging.

[STEPS]
1. Vitamin C (scurvy): bleeding gums, loose teeth, slow wound healing, fatigue. Onset 1-3 months. Sources: rose hips, pine needles, greens, berries.
2. Vitamin A: night blindness, dry skin. Sources: orange/yellow plants, liver, dark greens.
3. Iron: fatigue, pallor, weakness, rapid heartbeat. Sources: nettle, meat, dark greens.
4. B vitamins: cracked lips, confusion, dermatitis. Sources: whole grains, meat, legumes.
5. Iodine: goiter (neck swelling), fatigue. Sources: seaweed, fish, iodized salt.

[WARNINGS]
! Scurvy can become fatal if untreated.
! Night blindness from vitamin A deficiency impairs safety.
! Iron deficiency severely reduces work capacity.
