[SUMMARY]
Systematic approach to estimating caloric expenditure vs intake to prevent dangerous energy debt. Critical for rationing and work planning.

[STEPS]
1. Estimate basal metabolic rate: ~1500-1800 kcal/day for average adult at rest.
2. Add activity multiplier: light work 1.5x, moderate 2x, heavy labor/cold 2.5-3x.
3. Track food intake roughly by source category.
4. If intake < expenditure: reduce non-essential activity, increase foraging priority.
5. Plan rest days into work schedules to reduce total caloric need.

[WARNINGS]
! Sustained caloric deficit causes muscle wasting, impaired judgment, and immune suppression.
! Cold environments dramatically increase caloric needs.
! Children and pregnant/nursing women need proportionally more.
