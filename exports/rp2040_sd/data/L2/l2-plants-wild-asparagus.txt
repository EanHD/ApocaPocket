[SUMMARY]
Feral asparagus grows along roadsides, fencerows, and irrigation ditches in temperate regions. Identical to cultivated asparagus. Spring spears are the edible part.

[STEPS]
1. Find mature fern-like plants in fall/winter to mark locations for spring harvest.
2. Return in spring to harvest emerging spears at 15-25cm height.
3. Snap spears at natural breaking point.
4. Eat raw or cooked — same as store-bought asparagus.

[WARNINGS]
! Asparagus berries are mildly toxic — do not eat the red berries.
! Avoid roadside plants exposed to heavy traffic or spraying.
