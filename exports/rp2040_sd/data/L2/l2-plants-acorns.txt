[SUMMARY]
Abundant fall nut crop requiring tannin leaching before consumption. Once processed, acorns provide excellent starch and fat. White oak group has less tannin than red oak.

[STEPS]
1. Collect mature fallen acorns; discard any with holes (weevil damage).
2. Shell and chop or grind nutmeat.
3. Leach tannins by soaking in multiple changes of water (cold water: days; hot water: hours).
4. Test by tasting — should have no bitterness remaining.
5. Dry and grind into flour, or use wet paste directly in recipes.

[WARNINGS]
! Unleached acorns are very bitter and can cause nausea/kidney stress.
! Red oak acorns require more leaching than white oak.
! Proper leaching is non-negotiable.
