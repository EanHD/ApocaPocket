[SUMMARY]
Large bright orange-and-yellow bracket fungus growing on hardwood trees. Meaty texture when young. One of the easier mushrooms to identify safely.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by large overlapping shelves, bright orange top and yellow pore surface (no gills), growing on standing/fallen hardwood.
2. Harvest young tender edges only — older portions become tough and chalky.
3. Spore print: white.
4. Cook thoroughly — slice and sauté, bread and fry, or add to soups.

[WARNINGS]
! Some people have GI reactions — try a small amount first.
! Avoid specimens growing on conifers, eucalyptus, or locust — higher reaction rates.
! Do not eat raw.
