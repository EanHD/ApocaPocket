[SUMMARY]
Insects are the most abundant and accessible animal protein source. Crickets, grasshoppers, grubs, and ants are widely eaten worldwide. Key rule: cook all insects before eating.

[STEPS]
1. Crickets and grasshoppers: collect in early morning when cold/sluggish. Remove legs (spiny). Roast or fry.
2. Grubs (beetle larvae): found in rotting logs. White, C-shaped. Roast until crispy.
3. Ants: collect workers (avoid fire ants). Roast to neutralize formic acid.
4. Termites: high in fat and protein. Collect from mounds. Roast.
5. General rule: avoid brightly colored insects (warning coloration), hairy caterpillars, and strong-smelling bugs.

[WARNINGS]
! ALWAYS cook insects — raw insects may carry parasites.
! Avoid brightly colored, hairy, or pungent species.
! People with shellfish allergies may react to insects (similar chitin proteins).
