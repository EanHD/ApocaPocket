[SUMMARY]
Aggressively invasive vine in southeastern US and warm climates. Leaves, flowers, shoots, and roots are all edible. Root starch is a traditional thickener in East Asian cooking.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by large trifoliate leaves, purple fragrant flower clusters, and aggressive climbing growth.
2. Young leaves and shoots: cook like greens.
3. Flowers: eat raw, make tea or jelly.
4. Roots: dig large tuberous roots, process for starch by crushing and washing.
5. Root starch settles out of water — dry for flour.

[WARNINGS]
! Avoid plants sprayed with herbicide — kudzu is heavily targeted.
! Roots require significant effort to dig.
