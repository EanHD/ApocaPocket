[SUMMARY]
Extremely nutritious green high in iron, calcium, and protein — but must be cooked or dried to neutralize stinging hairs. One of the most nutrient-dense wild foods.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by opposite toothed leaves, square stem, and visible stinging hairs.
2. Harvest with gloves — top 4-6 leaves of young spring plants.
3. Cook by boiling, steaming, or sautéing (2+ minutes destroys sting).
4. Dried nettle also loses sting and makes excellent tea.
5. Cooking water can be drunk as nutritious broth.

[WARNINGS]
! Handle ONLY with gloves until cooked — stinging hairs inject formic acid.
! Do not eat raw.
! Older plants develop cystoliths that may irritate kidneys — harvest young.
