[SUMMARY]
Highly prized spring mushroom with distinctive honeycomb-ridged cap. Key identification: cap is hollow from top to bottom when sliced lengthwise.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by honeycomb/ridged cap attached at base of cap to stem, and completely hollow interior.
2. Slice lengthwise to confirm single continuous hollow chamber.
3. Found in spring near dead elms, tulip poplars, old orchards, and burn sites.
4. Cook thoroughly before eating — never eat raw morels.

[WARNINGS]
! FALSE MOREL (Gyromitra) is DEADLY — has brain-like wrinkled (not honeycomb) cap and is NOT hollow inside (cottony/chambered).
! Always slice to confirm hollow interior.
! Raw morels cause GI illness.
