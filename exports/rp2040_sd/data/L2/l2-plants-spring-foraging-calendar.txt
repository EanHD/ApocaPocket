[SUMMARY]
Month-by-month guide to spring foraging in temperate North America (USDA zones 4-7). Spring is the most abundant foraging season — young greens are tender, nutritious, and easy to identify. Adjust timing by 2-3 weeks per zone.

[STEPS]
1. MARCH (early spring, snow melting): Chickweed (Stellaria media) — one of the first greens. Grows in mats in disturbed soil. Eat raw in salads. Dandelion rosettes emerge — harvest before flowering for mildest flavor. Chives/wild onions — green shoots appear in fields. Garlic mustard basal rosettes — pull entire plant (it's invasive).
2. APRIL (mid-spring, soil warming): Stinging nettles — harvest top 4-6 inches with gloves. Most nutritious wild green. Cook or dry. Ramps (wild leeks) — distinctive garlic-onion smell, broad leaves, eastern forests. Harvest sparingly (slow to reproduce). Violet leaves and flowers — mild, high in vitamin C. Eat raw. Cleavers (Galium) — use tips raw or cooked. Traditional spring tonic.
3. APRIL-MAY: Wild asparagus — looks exactly like garden asparagus, found near old homesteads and field edges. Fiddlehead ferns (ostrich fern ONLY — other ferns may be carcinogenic) — harvest tightly coiled fronds, must be cooked (boil 10 min or steam 15). Japanese knotweed young shoots — peel, cook like rhubarb. Invasive — harvest aggressively.
4. MAY (late spring): Lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album) begins — one of the most nutritious wild greens. Amaranth shoots emerge. Wild strawberry flowers appear (fruit in June). Elderflowers for tea and fritters. Basswood/linden leaves — young leaves are mild and edible raw.
5. SPRING ROOTS: Burdock root (best in first year plants, before flowering stalk). Dandelion root (roast for coffee). Chicory root (roast for coffee). Jerusalem artichoke (dig early spring before growth starts).
6. SPRING BARK AND SAP: Birch sap (tap in March when sap flows — drill small hole, insert tube). Maple sap (same method — 40:1 sap to syrup ratio). Pine inner bark (cambium) — scrape and eat raw or dry and grind to flour. White pine, red pine, and spruce all work.
7. SPRING MUSHROOMS: Morels (Morchella spp.) — April through May, near dead elms, tulip poplars, ash trees, and in old orchards. The prize of spring foraging. Dryad's saddle (Cerioporus squamosus) — large shelf mushroom on dead hardwoods. Best when young and tender.
8. IDENTIFICATION PRACTICE: spring is the best time to learn plants — they change rapidly week to week. Visit the same areas weekly and photograph changes. Press specimens. This builds the visual library essential for confident foraging.

[WARNINGS]
! Spring is also when the most toxic plants emerge — poison hemlock, water hemlock, and death camas are all spring plants
! Many edible spring greens have toxic look-alikes when young. Wait for positive identifying features to develop if unsure.
! Harvest sustainably — take no more than 10% of any wild plant population
! Foraging in national parks is generally prohibited — know local regulations
