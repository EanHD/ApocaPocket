[SUMMARY]
Field food safety principles to prevent the GI illness that can be deadly when medical care is unavailable. Cook thoroughly, eat promptly, store carefully.

[STEPS]
1. Cook all meat, fish, and eggs to internal temps that kill pathogens (boiling/thorough cooking if no thermometer).
2. Eat cooked food within 2 hours or keep below 5°C / above 60°C.
3. Clean hands and tools before food preparation.
4. Separate raw meat from other foods.
5. When in doubt about freshness: smell, visual check, discard if any doubt.

[WARNINGS]
! Diarrheal illness causes rapid dehydration — potentially fatal without treatment.
! Botulism risk in improperly preserved/canned foods.
! Do not rely on smell alone for meat safety.
