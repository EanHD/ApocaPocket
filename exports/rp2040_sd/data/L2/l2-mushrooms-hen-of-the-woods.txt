[SUMMARY]
Large polypore fruiting at the base of oaks in fall. Overlapping gray-brown fan-shaped caps. Excellent flavor and can produce massive fruitings (5-25kg).

[STEPS]
1. Identify by cluster of overlapping gray-brown fan-shaped caps with white pore surface underneath, growing at base of living/dead oaks.
2. Spore print: white.
3. Harvest with knife; can return to same tree annually.
4. Clean well (harbors debris). Cook thoroughly — roast, sauté, or dry.

[WARNINGS]
! Berkeley's polypore (Bondarzewia berkeleyi) is a larger, tougher lookalike — has thicker flesh and bitter taste.
! Black-staining polypore (Meripilus sumstinei) bruises black.
! Both lookalikes are not deadly but are poor eating.
