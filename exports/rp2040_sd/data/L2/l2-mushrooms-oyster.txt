[SUMMARY]
Common wood-decay mushroom growing in shelf-like clusters on dead/dying hardwoods. Mild flavor, good texture. Can fruit year-round in mild climates. Also easy to cultivate.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by fan/oyster-shaped caps, white to gray-brown color, decurrent gills running down a short offset stem, growing on wood.
2. Spore print: white to pale lilac.
3. Harvest by twisting or cutting cluster from wood.
4. Cook before eating — good sautéed, in soups, or dried.

[WARNINGS]
! Angel wing (Pleurocybella porrigens) is a thin white lookalike on conifers — avoid white species on conifer wood.
! Some people sensitive — try small amounts first.
