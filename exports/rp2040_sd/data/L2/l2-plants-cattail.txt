[SUMMARY]
Wetland staple plant; nearly every part is edible across seasons. Rhizomes provide starch, shoots are eaten like asparagus, pollen is a protein-rich flour supplement.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by tall linear leaves, distinctive brown cylindrical seed head, and wetland habitat.
2. Spring: harvest young shoots when under 60cm — peel and eat raw or cooked.
3. Early summer: collect green flower spikes, boil like corn.
4. Mid-summer: shake pollen from male spike into bag for flour.
5. Fall/winter: dig rhizomes, wash, crush in water, settle starch.

[WARNINGS]
! Confirm wetland is not contaminated with industrial runoff or sewage.
! Wild iris (toxic) grows in similar habitats — iris leaves have a distinct midrib and fan arrangement vs cattail's linear wrap.
