[SUMMARY]
Common lawn and trailside plant with edible leaves and medicinal wound-care tradition. Young leaves eaten raw or cooked; older leaves are fibrous but still nutritious.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by basal rosette of broad oval leaves with prominent parallel veins and a central flower spike.
2. Harvest young leaves for salads; older leaves are better cooked.
3. Seeds can be collected and ground as a fiber supplement (related to psyllium).
4. Poultice of crushed leaves traditionally applied to insect stings and minor wounds.

[WARNINGS]
! Not the same as banana-family plantain.
! Avoid harvesting from treated lawns.
