[SUMMARY]
Map edible species by biome and seasonal availability for collection planning.

[STEPS]
1. Tag each species by biome and latitude band.
2. Add growth-stage cues for safe harvest windows.
3. Track nutrient density by stage when known.
4. Prioritize resilient high-yield species lists.

[WARNINGS]
! Mis-timed harvest can increase toxicity in some species.
! Urban/roadside plants may accumulate contaminants.
