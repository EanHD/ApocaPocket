[SUMMARY]
Large white ball-shaped mushroom found in fields and meadows. Safe when interior is uniformly white. One of the safest beginner mushrooms with a critical safety check.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by large (10-50cm+) round white form with no visible stem, cap, or gills externally.
2. CRITICAL: Slice in half from top to bottom.
3. Interior MUST be uniformly pure white with no outline of a developing mushroom inside.
4. If uniformly white: safe to eat. Slice and cook like tofu — fry, bread, or grill.

[WARNINGS]
! If interior shows ANY discoloration (yellow/brown/green): too old, discard.
! If interior shows outline of cap/gills: it is a young Amanita (potentially deadly) — DISCARD IMMEDIATELY.
! Always slice and inspect interior before eating.
