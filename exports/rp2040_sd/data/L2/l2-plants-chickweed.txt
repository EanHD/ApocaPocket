[SUMMARY]
Mild-flavored cool-season green found worldwide in disturbed soils. Excellent raw salad plant with good vitamin C content.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by small opposite leaves, single line of hairs along stem (alternating sides), tiny white star-shaped flowers with deeply cleft petals.
2. Harvest above-ground portions; snip with scissors.
3. Best eaten raw — mild, slightly sweet.
4. Cooks down significantly; add at end of cooking.

[WARNINGS]
! Spurge (Euphorbia) can be confused — check for milky sap (chickweed has clear sap).
! Mouse-ear chickweed (Cerastium) is also edible but hairy.
