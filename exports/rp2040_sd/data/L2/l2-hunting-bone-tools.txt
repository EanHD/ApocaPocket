[SUMMARY]
Animal bones, antler, and shell are excellent tool materials — harder than wood, workable without metal tools, and abundantly available after processing game. Bone needles, awls, fishhooks, scrapers, and pressure flakers are among the most useful tools in a survival toolkit.

[STEPS]
1. BONE NEEDLE: essential for sewing hide, clothing, and shelter materials. Select a splinter from a leg bone midshaft (densest area). Grind on a rough stone to a 2-3 inch length, 1/8 inch diameter. Taper one end to a sharp point. Drill or gouge an eye hole near the blunt end using a sharp stone or thorns. Sand smooth. A bone needle with sinew thread sews leather as well as a steel needle.
2. AWL: thick bone splinter ground to a sharp point, 3-4 inches long. Used to punch holes in leather for sewing, basket-making, and lashing. Handle: wrap the blunt end with cordage or set in a short wooden handle with pitch glue. The most-used bone tool.
3. FISHHOOK: split a small bone (bird bone, rib tip, or dense fish bone) into thin strips. Carve into a J-shape or gorge hook (straight double-pointed hook that turns sideways in the fish's throat). Groove the shank for line attachment. Bone hooks are brittle — make several and carry spares.
4. SCRAPER: large flat piece of leg bone, broken to create a sharp edge. Use for hide fleshing, wood shaving, and food preparation. The scapula (shoulder blade) of a deer is a natural scraper — sharpen the thin edge on a stone.
5. ANTLER TOOLS: antler is denser than bone and more resistant to shattering. Antler tines make excellent: pressure flakers (for knapping stone tools), punches (for leatherwork), and handles for stone blades (split the base, insert blade, bind with wet sinew that shrinks tight when dry).
6. ANTLER WEDGE: cut a 6-inch section of antler beam. Use as a wedge for splitting wood — drive into a log with a wooden mallet. Antler absorbs the hammer blows without mushrooming like wood wedges.
7. SHELL TOOLS: large freshwater mussel shells make excellent scrapers, spoons, and cutting edges. The edge is naturally sharp. Clam and oyster shells work as scoops and containers. Abalone shell (where available) is extremely tough.
8. WORKING BONE: score with a sharp stone, then snap along the score line. Grind to shape on sandstone or any rough rock (use water for smoother finish). Polish with fine sand and leather. Boiling bone briefly (10-15 minutes) makes it easier to carve while warm, then it hardens as it cools.
9. PRESERVATION: oil finished bone tools with animal fat to prevent drying and cracking. Store dry. A well-made bone needle or awl lasts months to years of regular use.

[WARNINGS]
! Bone dust from grinding/sanding is an irritant — work outdoors and avoid breathing dust
! Fresh bone splinters easily — let bones dry for 1-2 weeks before working, or boil briefly to harden
! Bone tools are strong in compression but snap under sudden lateral force — don't use as pry bars
! Always use the densest bone sections (long bone midshaft, antler tines) for tools that bear force
