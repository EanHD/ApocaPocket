[SUMMARY]
Perennial sunflower relative producing starchy tubers rich in inulin. Extremely productive and spreads aggressively. Good survival crop.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by tall sunflower-like plant (2-3m) with small yellow flowers and rough opposite leaves.
2. Dig tubers after first frost (sweeter) through winter.
3. Eat raw (crunchy, nutty) or cooked (roast, boil, sauté).
4. Replant small tubers for next season — very low maintenance.

[WARNINGS]
! High inulin content causes significant gas/bloating in many people — introduce gradually.
! Can become invasive — plant with containment plan.
