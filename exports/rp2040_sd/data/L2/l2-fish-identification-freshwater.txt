[SUMMARY]
Basic identification of common edible freshwater fish families. Most freshwater fish are edible when properly cooked, but some carry parasite risks.

[STEPS]
1. Sunfish/bluegill: small, pan-sized, found in ponds and slow streams. Easiest beginner target.
2. Catfish: bottom feeders, whisker barbels, scaleless. Found in rivers and ponds. Excellent eating.
3. Trout: cold clear streams, spotted sides. Cook same day — spoils fast.
4. Carp: large, common in warm water. Bony but edible — score flesh before cooking.
5. General: gut and cook all fish promptly. Firm flesh and clear eyes indicate freshness.

[WARNINGS]
! Cook all freshwater fish thoroughly — many carry parasites (tapeworm, liver flukes).
! Avoid fish from obviously polluted water.
! Pufferfish (if encountered) are extremely toxic — avoid entirely.
