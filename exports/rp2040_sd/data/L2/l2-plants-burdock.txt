[SUMMARY]
Large biennial with edible taproot (gobo) and young stalks. First-year roots are tender and starchy. Widely cultivated in East Asian cuisine.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by very large heart-shaped leaves (woolly underneath), purple thistle-like flowers, and hooked burs.
2. Harvest first-year roots (rosette stage, no flower stalk) in fall or early spring.
3. Peel and slice root; soak in water to prevent browning.
4. Cook by boiling, stir-frying, or roasting. Young leaf stalks also edible peeled and cooked.

[WARNINGS]
! First-year burdock rosette can resemble rhubarb or cocklebur — check for woolly leaf undersides.
! Do not confuse with toxic nightshades in early growth.
