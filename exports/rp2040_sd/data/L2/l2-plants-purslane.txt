[SUMMARY]
Succulent garden weed and one of the richest plant sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Crunchy, slightly sour. Thrives in heat and poor soil.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by thick succulent stems (often reddish), small paddle-shaped leaves, tiny yellow flowers.
2. Harvest stems and leaves; entire above-ground plant is edible.
3. Eat raw in salads or cook briefly (thickens soups like okra).
4. Seeds are tiny but edible and nutritious.

[WARNINGS]
! Spurge (Euphorbia) is a toxic lookalike — check for milky sap (purslane has clear sap) and round vs paddle leaves.
! Contains oxalates — moderate consumption if kidney stone prone.
