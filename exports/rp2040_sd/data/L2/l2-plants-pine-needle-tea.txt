[SUMMARY]
Emergency vitamin C source available year-round in conifer forests. Fresh pine needles steeped in hot water produce a mildly resinous, citrusy tea.

[STEPS]
1. Identify true pines by needles in bundled clusters (fascicles of 2, 3, or 5).
2. Harvest fresh green needles; chop or bruise to release oils.
3. Steep in hot (not boiling) water for 10-20 minutes.
4. Strain and drink. Add sweetener if available.

[WARNINGS]
! AVOID yew (Taxus), Norfolk Island pine, and Ponderosa pine — toxic.
! Pregnant women should avoid pine needle tea (potential abortifacient).
! Some cypress-family trees look similar — confirm true Pinus by fascicle bundles.
