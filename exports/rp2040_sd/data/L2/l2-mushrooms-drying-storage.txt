[SUMMARY]
Mushrooms are 90% water and spoil within days of harvest. Drying is the simplest and most effective preservation method — properly dried mushrooms retain nutritional value and flavor for 1-2 years. No equipment needed beyond sun, air, and a surface.

[STEPS]
1. CLEANING: brush off dirt with a dry brush or cloth. Do NOT wash mushrooms before drying — added water dramatically extends drying time and promotes bacterial growth. Cut away any insect-damaged sections.
2. SLICING: slice mushrooms 1/4 inch (6mm) thick for even drying. Small mushrooms (chanterelles) can be halved. Very large caps can be scored on the gill side to improve airflow. Consistent thickness ensures even drying.
3. SUN DRYING: lay slices on a clean elevated surface (screen, bamboo mat, clean cloth over a rack) in direct sunlight with good airflow. Flip every few hours. Takes 1-3 days depending on humidity and sun intensity. Bring inside at night to prevent dew re-moistening.
4. FIRE/HEAT DRYING: place slices on a rack 2-3 feet above a low fire or near a wood stove. Temperature should be 45-55°C (113-131°F) — hot enough to evaporate moisture, not hot enough to cook. Takes 6-12 hours. Better than sun drying in humid or cloudy conditions.
5. DEHYDRATOR: if available, set to 50°C (125°F). Single layer on trays. Takes 4-8 hours. Most reliable method.
6. TESTING DRYNESS: properly dried mushrooms should SNAP cleanly when bent, not bend. They should feel papery and lightweight. If they bend or feel leathery, continue drying. Moisture content target: below 10%.
7. STORAGE: pack dried mushrooms in airtight containers — glass jars, sealed plastic bags with air squeezed out, or vacuum-sealed bags. Add a small packet of rice or silica gel as desiccant. Store in cool, dark, dry location.
8. SHELF LIFE: properly dried and stored mushrooms last 1-2 years. Check periodically for moisture or mold. If any mold appears, discard the entire batch.
9. REHYDRATION: soak in warm water for 20-30 minutes. The soaking liquid is intensely flavored — use it in cooking (strain through cloth to remove grit). Rehydrated mushrooms have a more concentrated flavor than fresh.
10. MUSHROOM POWDER: grind fully dried mushrooms in a mortar and pestle or crush in a bag. Powder is a versatile seasoning and thickener for soups and stews. Stores even longer than sliced — 2-3 years in sealed container.

[WARNINGS]
! Mushrooms must be positively identified BEFORE preservation — drying does NOT destroy mushroom toxins (amatoxin in death caps survives all processing)
! Improperly dried mushrooms (still flexible/leathery) will mold in storage — they must be crisp/snap when bent
! Store away from moisture — even brief exposure to humidity can restart mold growth
! Rehydrated mushrooms should be used immediately — do not re-dry and re-store
