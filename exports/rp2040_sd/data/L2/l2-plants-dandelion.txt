[SUMMARY]
Ubiquitous perennial weed; all parts edible — leaves, flowers, and roots. High in vitamins A, C, K, and iron. One of the safest beginner foraging plants.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by rosette of deeply toothed leaves, hollow stem, single yellow composite flower, milky latex sap.
2. Harvest young leaves before flowering for mildest flavor.
3. Flowers can be eaten raw, battered and fried, or infused.
4. Roots can be roasted as coffee substitute or boiled as vegetable.
5. Wash thoroughly; avoid roadsides and treated lawns.

[WARNINGS]
! Avoid areas treated with herbicides or pesticides.
! Cat's ear (Hypochaeris radicata) is a common lookalike — has branched stems and hairy leaves, but is also edible.
