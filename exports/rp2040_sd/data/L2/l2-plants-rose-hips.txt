[SUMMARY]
Fruit of wild roses; extremely high in vitamin C (up to 50x more than oranges). Available fall through winter. Excellent dried for tea or processed into jam.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by thorny stems, compound leaves with serrated leaflets, and red/orange fruit (hip) after flowering.
2. Harvest after first frost for best sweetness.
3. Split hips, remove seeds and irritating hairs inside.
4. Dry for tea, or cook into syrup/jam.
5. Avoid boiling — heat degrades vitamin C. Use warm water for tea.

[WARNINGS]
! Interior hairs are an irritant — strain well and remove seeds.
! Do not harvest from ornamental roses that may be sprayed.
