[SUMMARY]
Smoking preserves meat and fish through dehydration, antimicrobial smoke compounds, and surface protein coagulation. Two methods: hot smoking (cooks AND preserves, 1-6 hours) and cold smoking (preserves only, 1-7 days). Proper smoking can preserve food for weeks to months without refrigeration.

[STEPS]
1. WOOD SELECTION: hardwoods only. BEST: hickory (strong, classic), oak (medium, versatile), apple/cherry (mild, sweet — best for fish), maple (mild, slightly sweet), alder (delicate — traditional for salmon). AVOID ALL conifers (pine, spruce, fir, cedar, cypress) — toxic resin.
2. HOT SMOKING (cook + preserve): Temperature 150-275°F (65-135°C) at meat level. Build a fire, let it burn down to coals, then add green/soaked hardwood chunks for smoke. Meat is placed 2-4 feet above the smoke source. Time: 2-6 hours depending on thickness. Meat is safe to eat immediately.
3. HOT SMOKE — FIELD SMOKER: dig a pit 12 inches deep, build fire inside. Place a grill of green wood sticks across the pit, 2 feet above the coals. Lay meat strips on the grill. Cover loosely with bark or green leaves to trap smoke (but allow airflow). Maintain steady thin smoke — flames = too hot.
4. COLD SMOKING (preserve only): Temperature 68-86°F (20-30°C) — NOT hot enough to cook. Requires a separate fire pit connected by a 6-10 foot tunnel/pipe to the smoking chamber. The tunnel cools the smoke. Smoke continuously for 1-7 days. Fish: 24-48 hours. Meat: 3-7 days.
5. COLD SMOKE PREREQUISITE — SALT CURE: before cold smoking, meat MUST be salt-cured. Rub meat generously with salt (1 lb salt per 10 lbs meat). Pack in salt for 7-14 days in cool conditions. Rinse off excess salt before smoking. Without salt-curing, cold smoking is unsafe.
6. MEAT PREPARATION: cut into strips 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, cutting WITH the grain for jerky-style. For whole fish: gut, remove head, butterfly (split along backbone), score flesh every 2 inches. Brine fish for 1 hour (1/3 cup salt per quart water) before smoking.
7. FIRE MANAGEMENT: the #1 mistake is too much flame and not enough smoke. Use smoldering wood, not burning wood. Soak wood chunks in water for 1 hour before adding to coals. Add a few chunks every 30-60 minutes. Smoke should be thin and blue, not thick and white (white smoke = too wet/cool, deposits creosote).
8. DONENESS — HOT SMOKE: meat is done when internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C) for meat, 145°F (63°C) for fish. Without a thermometer: fish flakes easily with a stick, meat tears apart at the grain (not bends). Surface should be dark golden to mahogany colored.
9. DONENESS — COLD SMOKE: meat/fish surface is dry and firm with a shiny dark pellicle (protein skin). Interior should be dry but still slightly pliable. Weight loss of 30-40% from fresh weight indicates adequate drying.
10. STORAGE: hot-smoked meat/fish keeps 1-2 weeks at room temperature, 1-2 months in cool conditions. Cold-smoked and salt-cured products keep 2-6 months in cool, dry, ventilated storage. Wrap in cloth (not plastic — needs airflow). Hang in a cool, dry, breezy location. Discard if slimy, foul-smelling, or moldy.

[WARNINGS]
! NEVER use resinous wood (pine, spruce, fir, cedar) for smoking food — resin deposits toxic creosote and produces bitter, potentially carcinogenic flavors
! Cold smoking is DANGEROUS without prior salt-curing — temperatures in the danger zone (40-140°F) allow bacterial growth. Salt-cure first.
! Improperly smoked meat can harbor botulism (anaerobic bacteria) — ensure thorough drying and smoking
! Smoke in well-ventilated area — carbon monoxide from smoldering fires is lethal in enclosed spaces
