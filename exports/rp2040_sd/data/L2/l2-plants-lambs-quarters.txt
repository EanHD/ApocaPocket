[SUMMARY]
One of the best wild spinach substitutes. Extremely common garden weed with diamond-shaped leaves coated in white mealy powder. More nutritious than cultivated spinach.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by diamond/goosefoot-shaped leaves with white powdery coating, especially on new growth.
2. Harvest young leaves and tender tops.
3. Cook like spinach — sauté, steam, or add to soups.
4. Seeds are edible and can be ground to flour (related to quinoa).

[WARNINGS]
! Contains oxalic acid — cook to reduce; avoid if prone to kidney stones.
! Can accumulate nitrates from fertilized soil.
