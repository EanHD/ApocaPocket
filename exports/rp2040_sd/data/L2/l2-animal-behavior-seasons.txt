[SUMMARY]
Understanding seasonal animal behavior cycles improves foraging success and safety. Animals are most active and predictable during feeding, breeding, and migration periods.

[STEPS]
1. Spring: breeding season — males territorial and visible. Nesting birds aggressive. Fish spawning in shallows.
2. Summer: dispersed feeding. Dawn/dusk activity peaks. Water sources become gathering points.
3. Fall: migration and fat-building. Best hunting season — animals are heaviest. Salmon runs. Nut/fruit competition.
4. Winter: reduced activity, concentrated near food/shelter. Tracking easiest in snow. Hibernators unavailable.

[WARNINGS]
! Breeding animals (especially bears, moose, elk) are more aggressive.
! Avoid disturbing nesting sites.
! Predator activity increases near concentrated prey.
