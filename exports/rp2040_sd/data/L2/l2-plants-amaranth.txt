[SUMMARY]
Dual-purpose plant providing both nutritious greens and protein-rich grain. Thrives in poor soils and heat. One of the most calorie-dense wild foods.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by alternate simple leaves, dense flower spikes (often red/purple), tiny seeds.
2. Harvest leaves when young for cooking like spinach.
3. Collect seed heads when dry; thresh and winnow seeds.
4. Seeds: toast lightly or grind into flour. High in lysine (rare in grains).
5. Boil greens briefly to reduce oxalates.

[WARNINGS]
! High oxalate content — cook before eating in quantity.
! Pigweed species can accumulate nitrates from fertilized soil.
