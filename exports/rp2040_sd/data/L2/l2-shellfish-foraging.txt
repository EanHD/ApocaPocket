[SUMMARY]
Coastal shellfish (mussels, clams, oysters, limpets) are calorie-dense and require no tools to collect, but carry serious toxin and contamination risks.

[STEPS]
1. Collect from rocks and tidal flats at low tide.
2. Mussels: pull from rocks, discard any that don't close when tapped (dead).
3. Clams: dig in sand/mud at water line.
4. Cook all shellfish thoroughly — boil until shells open.
5. Discard any that do not open after cooking.

[WARNINGS]
! RED TIDE / paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is not destroyed by cooking — can be fatal.
! Avoid harvesting during warm months or algal blooms.
! Do not eat shellfish near sewage outflows, ports, or industrial areas.
! Quarantine areas may not be marked post-collapse.
