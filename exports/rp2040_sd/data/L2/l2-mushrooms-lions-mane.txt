[SUMMARY]
Distinctive white globe of cascading teeth/spines growing on dead or dying hardwoods. No dangerous lookalikes among Hericium species — all are edible.

[STEPS]
1. Identify by white globe shape with long dangling spines/teeth (no cap, no gills).
2. Found on dead or wounded hardwoods (oak, beech, maple), often high up.
3. Harvest when white and firm — yellowing indicates age.
4. Tear into pieces and sauté in butter — has a seafood/lobster-like flavor.

[WARNINGS]
! All Hericium species are edible, making this a very safe genus.
! Old specimens (yellow/brown) may cause GI upset — harvest fresh.
