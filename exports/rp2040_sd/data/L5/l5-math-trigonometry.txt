[SUMMARY]
Sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for calculating angles, heights, and distances in construction and surveying.

[STEPS]
1. Learn the three primary trig ratios: sin = opposite/hypotenuse, cos = adjacent/hypotenuse, tan = opposite/adjacent.
2. Memorize key angle values: 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° and their ratios.
3. Apply tangent to measure heights of structures or trees using shadow length.
4. Use sine rule and cosine rule for non-right triangles in land surveying.
5. Practice triangulation: measure one baseline and two angles to find unknown distances.

[WARNINGS]
! Small angle measurement errors multiply over distance.
! Always verify with a second method when possible.
