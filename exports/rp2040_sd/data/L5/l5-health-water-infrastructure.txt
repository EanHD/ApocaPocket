[SUMMARY]
Designing community-scale water collection, treatment, and distribution systems.

[STEPS]
1. Identify water sources: springs, wells, rainwater, surface water (in order of preference).
2. Protect spring sources with a spring box to prevent contamination.
3. Build slow sand filters for community water treatment (effective, low-tech).
4. Design gravity-fed distribution from elevated storage tanks.
5. Establish water testing routines and maintenance schedules.

[WARNINGS]
! Untreated surface water carries parasites, bacteria, and viruses.
! Pipe systems require ongoing maintenance—train local technicians.
