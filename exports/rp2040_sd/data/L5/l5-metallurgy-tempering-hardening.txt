[SUMMARY]
How to harden and temper steel tools for optimal edge retention and toughness.

[STEPS]
1. Heat steel to critical temperature (cherry red, ~800°C) uniformly.
2. Quench in water or oil for maximum hardness (martinsite formation).
3. Clean the surface bright to observe temper colors.
4. Reheat slowly and watch oxide colors: straw (220°C) for cutting edges, blue (300°C) for springs.
5. Quench again when desired color reaches the working edge.

[WARNINGS]
! Over-hardened steel is brittle and shatters—always temper after hardening.
! Quenching hot metal in water produces steam—keep face clear.
