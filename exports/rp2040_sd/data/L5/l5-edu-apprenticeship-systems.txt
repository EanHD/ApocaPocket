[SUMMARY]
Structured apprenticeship programs for transferring critical trade skills across generations.

[STEPS]
1. Identify critical skills that must be preserved (smithing, medicine, agriculture, etc.).
2. Pair each master practitioner with 1-3 apprentices.
3. Structure learning progression: observe → assist → perform under supervision → solo.
4. Set milestones and practical tests for advancement.
5. Require journeyman apprentices to teach beginners (teaching reinforces learning).

[WARNINGS]
! Single points of failure: if only one person knows a skill, train backups urgently.
! Apprenticeships take years—start training before current masters age out.
