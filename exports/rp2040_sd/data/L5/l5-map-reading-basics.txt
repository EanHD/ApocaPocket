[SUMMARY]
Map interpretation and terrain-based planning for movement and logistics.

[STEPS]
1. Read contour intervals and terrain features.
2. Convert map scale to real distance.
3. Plan routes by grade, water, and hazard constraints.
4. Use handrails/backstops and checkpointing.

[WARNINGS]
! Magnetic declination errors accumulate over distance.
! Route plans need weather and daylight contingencies.
