[SUMMARY]
Navigating by tracking direction and distance traveled from a known starting point.

[STEPS]
1. Calibrate your pace count: walk 100m on flat ground, count double-steps.
2. Use a compass bearing and walk a set number of paces to travel known distances.
3. Record each leg: bearing, pace count, and terrain notes.
4. Adjust pace count for slope (uphill = shorter paces) and terrain (brush = more paces).
5. Cross-check position with terrain features whenever possible.

[WARNINGS]
! Errors accumulate with distance—verify position frequently.
! Detours around obstacles must be carefully tracked to avoid drift.
