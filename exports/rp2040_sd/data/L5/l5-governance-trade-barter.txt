[SUMMARY]
Establishing fair exchange systems for goods and services when currency is unavailable.

[STEPS]
1. Identify community surpluses and deficits to find trade opportunities.
2. Establish common value benchmarks (e.g., labor-hours, grain weight) for comparison.
3. Use direct barter for simple two-party exchanges.
4. Create credit/debt tracking for deferred exchanges (IOUs with witnesses).
5. Designate market days and neutral trading locations for inter-community exchange.

[WARNINGS]
! Barter is inefficient for complex economies—develop commodity money when stable.
! Disputes over value require pre-agreed arbitration.
