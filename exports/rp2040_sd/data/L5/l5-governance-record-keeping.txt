[SUMMARY]
Systems for maintaining community records, inventories, and institutional knowledge.

[STEPS]
1. Designate a record keeper and establish standard formats.
2. Record vital statistics: births, deaths, marriages, population counts.
3. Maintain resource inventories with regular audits.
4. Document decisions, agreements, and the reasoning behind them.
5. Store records in multiple locations to protect against loss.

[WARNINGS]
! Records on paper require protection from water, fire, and insects.
! Undocumented decisions lead to disputes—write it down.
