[SUMMARY]
Choosing and building appropriate foundations based on soil conditions and structure type.

[STEPS]
1. Assess soil: dig test pits to check bearing capacity—clay, sand, rock, or fill.
2. Use spread footings for walls: widen the base to distribute load over soft soil.
3. Use pier/post foundations on slopes or in wet areas to elevate the structure.
4. Build slab-on-grade for simple structures on stable, level ground.
5. Ensure foundations extend below frost line to prevent heaving.

[WARNINGS]
! Poor foundations cause total structural failure—never skip soil assessment.
! Wet or expansive clay soils require special drainage and wider footings.
