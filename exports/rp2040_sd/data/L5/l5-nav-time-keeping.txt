[SUMMARY]
Measuring and tracking time using shadow sticks, sundials, and simple mechanical clocks.

[STEPS]
1. Shadow stick method: plant vertical stick, mark shadow tip at intervals to find east-west line and solar noon.
2. Build a simple sundial: angle the gnomon to your latitude, mark hour lines.
3. Use water clocks (clepsydra) for consistent timing regardless of weather.
4. Construct candle clocks with marked intervals for nighttime timing.
5. Synchronize community time using solar noon (shortest shadow) as daily reference.

[WARNINGS]
! Sundials show solar time, which varies from clock time seasonally.
! Water clocks need consistent water temperature for accuracy.
