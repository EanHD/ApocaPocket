REGION: global
CONFIDENCE: high

[SUMMARY]
Simple cipher methods for protecting sensitive communications from interception.

[STEPS]
1. Use substitution ciphers (Caesar shift) for basic privacy; easy but breakable.
2. Use transposition ciphers: rearrange letter positions using a keyword grid.
3. Combine substitution + transposition for stronger encryption.
4. One-time pad: use a random key as long as the message for unbreakable encryption.
5. Pre-distribute codebooks to trusted parties; destroy after use.

[WARNINGS]
! Simple ciphers are breakable by frequency analysis—don't rely on them for critical secrets.
! Key distribution is the hardest problem—protect keys physically.
