[SUMMARY]
Compass-and-straightedge methods for laying out perpendicular lines, bisecting angles, and constructing regular shapes.

[STEPS]
1. Construct a perpendicular bisector: arc from each endpoint, connect intersections.
2. Bisect any angle with equal arcs from the vertex, then arc from each intersection.
3. Construct a right angle using a 3-4-5 triangle with rope or stakes.
4. Lay out a square foundation by constructing perpendiculars at corners.
5. Create regular polygons (hexagon, octagon) inscribed in circles for structural layouts.

[WARNINGS]
! Use taut string or rigid straightedge—sagging introduces error.
! Mark points clearly; lost reference marks require starting over.
