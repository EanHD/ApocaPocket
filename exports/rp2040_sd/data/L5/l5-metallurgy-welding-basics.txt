[SUMMARY]
Joining iron and steel pieces by heating to welding temperature and hammering together.

[STEPS]
1. Prepare joint surfaces: scarf (overlap) or butt joint, clean of scale and dirt.
2. Apply flux (borax or fine sand) to prevent oxidation at the joint.
3. Heat both pieces to bright yellow/white heat (~1300°C for mild steel).
4. Quickly bring pieces together and strike with firm, rapid hammer blows.
5. Reheat and re-strike as needed; inspect by bending—a good weld won't separate.

[WARNINGS]
! Welding temperature steel throws sparks—clear flammable materials.
! Flux spatters on contact—wear eye protection and leather apron.
