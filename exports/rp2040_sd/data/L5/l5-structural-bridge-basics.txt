[SUMMARY]
Fundamental bridge types, their load-carrying principles, and when to use each.

[STEPS]
1. Beam bridges: simplest type; span limited by material strength and depth.
2. Arch bridges: convert vertical loads to compression along the curve into abutments.
3. Suspension bridges: cables in tension carry the deck via hangers; requires strong anchorages.
4. Select bridge type based on span, materials available, and load requirements.
5. Always include safety railings, approach grading, and drainage.

[WARNINGS]
! Dynamic loads (marching, wind) can cause resonance—break step on bridges.
! Abutments must be anchored in solid ground or rock.
