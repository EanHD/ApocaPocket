[SUMMARY]
Maintaining and teaching writing for record-keeping and knowledge preservation.

[STEPS]
1. Prioritize literacy education for all community members.
2. Produce ink from charcoal/soot mixed with water and a binder (gum arabic, egg).
3. Make pens from reeds, quills, or sharpened sticks.
4. Produce paper from plant fiber pulp, or use birch bark, clay tablets, or slate.
5. Standardize spelling and abbreviations for official records.

[WARNINGS]
! Ink fades over time—use carbon-based inks for permanence.
! Damp storage destroys paper—keep records dry and ventilated.
