[SUMMARY]
Understanding how materials respond to loads, and how to apply safety factors to prevent failure.

[STEPS]
1. Define stress (force/area) and strain (deformation/original length).
2. Identify yield strength (permanent deformation begins) vs. ultimate strength (failure).
3. Apply safety factors: design load = ultimate strength / safety factor (typically 2-4 for critical structures).
4. Recognize failure modes: tension, compression, shear, buckling, fatigue.
5. Test materials empirically when data is unavailable—load incrementally and observe.

[WARNINGS]
! Fatigue failure occurs below yield strength after many load cycles.
! Notches and holes concentrate stress—round all corners.
