[SUMMARY]
Creating a basic legal framework with clear rules, due process, and proportional enforcement.

[STEPS]
1. Establish core rules by community consensus focusing on safety and cooperation.
2. Write rules in plain language; post publicly for all to see.
3. Create due process: accused must be heard before judgment.
4. Apply proportional consequences—punishment fits the offense.
5. Establish an appeals process to prevent abuse of authority.

[WARNINGS]
! Arbitrary enforcement destroys rule of law—apply rules consistently.
! Overly harsh penalties breed resentment and rebellion.
