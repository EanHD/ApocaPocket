[SUMMARY]
Preventive dental care practices to maintain oral health without modern dentistry.

[STEPS]
1. Brush teeth after meals using frayed twig (miswak/neem), charcoal powder, or baking soda.
2. Floss with thin thread, sinew, or plant fiber between teeth daily.
3. Rinse mouth with salt water to reduce bacteria and inflammation.
4. Avoid excessive sugar and acidic foods that erode enamel.
5. Address toothaches early with clove oil (eugenol) for pain relief.

[WARNINGS]
! Dental infections can become life-threatening—don't ignore persistent pain or swelling.
! Extraction without training risks broken jaw or uncontrolled bleeding.
