[SUMMARY]
How to transmit and transform rotary and linear motion using gears, pulleys, levers, and linkages.

[STEPS]
1. Apply lever classes: first (fulcrum between), second (load between), third (effort between).
2. Use gear ratios to trade speed for torque: large driving small = faster, less torque.
3. Build simple pulley systems: each additional pulley halves the required force.
4. Create linkages (four-bar, crank-slider) to convert rotary to linear motion.
5. Fabricate wooden or cast-metal gears for low-speed, high-torque applications.

[WARNINGS]
! Gear teeth must mesh properly or they strip under load.
! Keep fingers and loose clothing away from moving mechanisms.
