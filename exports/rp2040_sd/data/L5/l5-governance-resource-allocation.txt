[SUMMARY]
Methods for fair and transparent allocation of scarce resources in a community.

[STEPS]
1. Inventory all available resources and estimate consumption rates.
2. Establish priority categories: survival needs first, then comfort, then luxury.
3. Use per-capita rationing for essentials (food, water, medicine).
4. Create transparent tracking systems visible to the community.
5. Review and adjust allocations regularly based on changing conditions.

[WARNINGS]
! Perceived unfairness causes social breakdown faster than actual scarcity.
! Secret stockpiles destroy trust—maintain transparency.
