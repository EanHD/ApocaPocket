[SUMMARY]
How to reduce friction in rotating and sliding mechanisms using bearings and lubricants.

[STEPS]
1. Understand sliding vs. rolling friction—rolling contact drastically reduces resistance.
2. Fabricate plain bearings from hardwood, bone, or cast bronze for shafts.
3. Use ball or roller bearings salvaged from vehicles for high-speed applications.
4. Apply lubricants: animal fat, plant oils, or petroleum products between sliding surfaces.
5. Maintain bearings: keep clean, re-lubricate regularly, replace when worn.

[WARNINGS]
! Dry bearings overheat and seize, potentially causing fires.
! Contaminated lubricant accelerates wear—filter or replace regularly.
