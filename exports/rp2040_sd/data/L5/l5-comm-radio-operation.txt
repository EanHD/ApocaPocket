[SUMMARY]
Operating and maintaining radio equipment for reliable long-distance electronic communication.

[STEPS]
1. Learn standard radio protocols: call signs, phonetic alphabet, brevity codes.
2. Understand frequency bands: HF (3-30 MHz) for long range, VHF/UHF for local.
3. Establish scheduled contact times (skeds) to conserve battery power.
4. Build simple antennas: dipole for HF, ground-plane for VHF.
5. Maintain equipment: protect from moisture, check connections, conserve batteries.

[WARNINGS]
! Radio transmissions reveal your location—use sparingly in hostile situations.
! Atmospheric conditions affect HF propagation—have backup communication plans.
