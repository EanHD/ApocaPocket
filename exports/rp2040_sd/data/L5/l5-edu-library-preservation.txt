[SUMMARY]
Protecting and preserving written knowledge for long-term community access.

[STEPS]
1. Store books in cool, dry, ventilated spaces away from sunlight.
2. Control pests with cedar, lavender, or diatomaceous earth—never chemicals near paper.
3. Repair torn pages with rice paste adhesive and thin tissue.
4. Copy deteriorating texts by hand before they become illegible.
5. Prioritize preservation: technical manuals and reference works first.

[WARNINGS]
! Mold destroys books rapidly—isolate and dry affected items immediately.
! Fire is the greatest threat—maintain separation and fire suppression near archives.
