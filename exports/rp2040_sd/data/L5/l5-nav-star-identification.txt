[SUMMARY]
Fifteen key navigation stars visible from different hemispheres and seasons. Knowing these stars lets you determine direction, approximate latitude, and time without instruments. Polaris gives true north; the Southern Cross gives true south; other stars rise due east and set due west.

[STEPS]
1. POLARIS (North Star) — Magnitude 2.0. FINDING IT: follow the two 'pointer stars' at the end of the Big Dipper's bowl (Dubhe and Merak) — they point directly to Polaris, which is at the tip of the Little Dipper's handle. Polaris is within 1° of true north. Its altitude above the horizon equals your latitude (e.g., 45° altitude = 45°N latitude).
2. BIG DIPPER (Ursa Major) — Not a star but essential. Seven bright stars forming a ladle. Visible year-round above 40°N. Pointer stars aim at Polaris. The arc of the handle points to Arcturus ('arc to Arcturus'). Rotates counterclockwise around Polaris through the night.
3. SOUTHERN CROSS (Crux) — Four bright stars in a cross pattern, visible below ~25°N. To find south: extend the long axis of the cross 4.5 times its length downward — that point is roughly above true south on the horizon. Distinguish from False Cross (larger, dimmer, nearby).
4. ORION — The most recognizable constellation globally. Three belt stars in a line are visible from both hemispheres. Orion's belt rises due east and sets due west (useful for E-W orientation). Betelgeuse (top-left, red) and Rigel (bottom-right, blue-white) are among the brightest stars.
5. SIRIUS (Dog Star) — Brightest star in the sky (magnitude -1.46). Found by following Orion's belt downward-left. Visible winter months (Nov-Mar) from most of the world. Rises due east.
6. ARCTURUS — 4th brightest star. Orange color. Found by following the arc of the Big Dipper's handle ('arc to Arcturus'). Visible spring through fall in the northern hemisphere. Rises in the northeast.
7. VEGA — 5th brightest star. Blue-white. Part of the Summer Triangle (with Deneb and Altair). Nearly overhead in summer at mid-northern latitudes. Will be the North Star in ~12,000 years due to precession.
8. CANOPUS — 2nd brightest star. Visible from latitudes south of ~37°N. Important southern hemisphere navigation star. Low on the southern horizon from southern US/Mediterranean.
9. CASSIOPEIA — W-shaped constellation opposite the Big Dipper from Polaris. When the Big Dipper is low/below horizon, Cassiopeia is high and points to Polaris. Visible year-round above 35°N.
10. DIRECTION FROM ANY STAR: drive two sticks into the ground 2-3 feet apart, aligned with any bright star. Wait 15-20 minutes. If the star moved: LEFT = you're facing roughly south. RIGHT = you're facing roughly north. UP = you're facing roughly east. DOWN = you're facing roughly west. This works for any star except Polaris.

[WARNINGS]
! Stars are only useful on clear nights — overcast skies require other navigation methods
! Magnetic declination does not affect stellar navigation, but light pollution makes stars hard to see near cities
! Stars move across the sky (~15° per hour) — take readings at known times for direction, or use stationary reference points (Polaris, Southern Cross method)
! Southern hemisphere has no true south pole star — use the Southern Cross method (less precise than Polaris)
