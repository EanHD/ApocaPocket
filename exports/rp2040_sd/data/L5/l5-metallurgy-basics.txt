[SUMMARY]
Introductory metallurgy for material selection and basic heat-treatment awareness.

[STEPS]
1. Identify ferrous vs non-ferrous classes.
2. Understand microstructure and heat effects.
3. Use hardness/ductility tradeoff in tool selection.
4. Record process temperatures and cooling rates.

[WARNINGS]
! High-temperature work requires fire and fume controls.
! Unknown alloys can release toxic fumes when heated.
