[SUMMARY]
Techniques for resolving disputes peacefully through structured mediation and de-escalation.

[STEPS]
1. Separate parties and allow cooling-off period before mediation.
2. Select a neutral mediator acceptable to both parties.
3. Let each side state their position without interruption.
4. Identify underlying interests (needs) vs. stated positions (demands).
5. Seek mutually acceptable solutions; document agreements and follow up.

[WARNINGS]
! Unresolved conflicts escalate—address disputes early.
! Mediator must remain genuinely neutral or lose credibility.
