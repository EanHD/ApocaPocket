[SUMMARY]
Core numeracy and algebra/geometry concepts required for technical rebuilding tasks.

[STEPS]
1. Maintain arithmetic and ratio fluency.
2. Use algebra for unknown variable solving.
3. Apply geometry for area/volume/angle tasks.
4. Practice estimation and error checking.

[WARNINGS]
! Calculation errors compound in structural/electrical work.
! Always include unit checks.
