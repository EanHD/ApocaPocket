[SUMMARY]
Working native copper and smelting copper ore for tools, vessels, and eventually bronze alloys.

[STEPS]
1. Find native copper nuggets in streambeds or green-stained rocks (malachite, azurite) for ore.
2. Cold-work native copper by hammering; anneal (heat to red and quench) to restore malleability.
3. Smelt copper ore in a charcoal furnace with bellows at ~1100°C.
4. Cast copper into molds for axes, vessels, and fittings.
5. Alloy with tin (5-12%) to create bronze—harder and better for tools.

[WARNINGS]
! Copper smelting produces toxic fumes—smelt only outdoors.
! Molten copper splashes violently if it contacts moisture.
