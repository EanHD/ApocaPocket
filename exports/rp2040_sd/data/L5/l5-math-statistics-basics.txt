[SUMMARY]
Mean, median, mode, and basic probability concepts for resource planning and risk assessment.

[STEPS]
1. Calculate mean (average) for resource consumption estimates.
2. Use median to find the middle value when outliers skew data.
3. Track mode to identify the most common outcome in repeated observations.
4. Estimate simple probability as favorable outcomes / total outcomes.
5. Apply expected value (probability × outcome) to compare risky decisions.

[WARNINGS]
! Small sample sizes produce unreliable statistics.
! Correlation does not imply causation—verify with controlled observation.
