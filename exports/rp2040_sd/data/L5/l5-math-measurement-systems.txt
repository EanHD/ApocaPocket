[SUMMARY]
Metric and imperial unit systems, conversion factors, and body-based estimation techniques.

[STEPS]
1. Learn key metric units: meter, kilogram, liter, and their prefixes (milli, centi, kilo).
2. Learn key imperial units: foot, pound, gallon and conversion to metric.
3. Memorize critical conversions: 1 inch ≈ 2.54 cm, 1 kg ≈ 2.2 lb, 1 mile ≈ 1.6 km.
4. Use body-based estimation: arm span ≈ height, pace length, hand span.
5. Always record units with every measurement to prevent errors.

[WARNINGS]
! Unit mismatch is a leading cause of engineering failures.
! Estimation is for planning only—measure precisely before building.
