[SUMMARY]
Building a functional magnetic compass from salvaged materials for direction finding.

[STEPS]
1. Find a magnetizable needle, pin, or thin steel wire.
2. Magnetize by stroking repeatedly in one direction with a magnet or by induction.
3. Float the needle on a small leaf or cork in still water.
4. The needle aligns north-south; mark the north-seeking end.
5. Calibrate against known landmarks or celestial observations.

[WARNINGS]
! Metal objects and electronics near the compass cause deviation.
! Magnetic north differs from true north—learn local declination.
