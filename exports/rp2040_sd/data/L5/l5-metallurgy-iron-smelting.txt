[SUMMARY]
How to produce usable iron from ore using a bloomery furnace with charcoal fuel.

[STEPS]
1. Identify iron ore: look for heavy, reddish-brown rocks (hematite, magnetite, bog iron).
2. Build a bloomery furnace from clay/stone, ~1m tall with tuyere (air inlet) near base.
3. Produce charcoal by slow-burning hardwood in a covered pit.
4. Charge furnace with alternating layers of charcoal and crushed ore.
5. Maintain forced air (bellows) for 6-10 hours to reach ~1200°C; extract bloom and hammer out slag.

[WARNINGS]
! Extreme heat and carbon monoxide—work outdoors with ventilation.
! Molten slag causes severe burns; wear protection and keep water away from furnace.
