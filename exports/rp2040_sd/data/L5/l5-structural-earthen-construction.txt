[SUMMARY]
Building durable structures from earth-based materials available almost anywhere.

[STEPS]
1. Test soil: ideal mix is ~70% sand, 30% clay; adjust with additives.
2. Adobe: form wet earth-straw mix into bricks, dry in sun for 2-4 weeks.
3. Rammed earth: compact damp soil in formwork layers of 10-15 cm.
4. Cob: hand-mix earth, sand, straw, and water; build in lifts without forms.
5. Protect all earthen walls with roof overhangs and waterproof foundation courses.

[WARNINGS]
! Earthen walls dissolve in prolonged rain without protection.
! Thick walls are needed for structural strength—minimum 30 cm.
