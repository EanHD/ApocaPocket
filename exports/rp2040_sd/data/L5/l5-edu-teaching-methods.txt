[SUMMARY]
Practical teaching techniques for transferring knowledge and skills in resource-limited settings.

[STEPS]
1. Explain concepts verbally, then demonstrate physically (tell-show-do).
2. Have learners practice immediately with guided feedback.
3. Use analogies connecting new concepts to familiar experiences.
4. Teach in small groups (5-8) for optimal engagement.
5. Test retention through practical application, not just recitation.

[WARNINGS]
! Skipping practice leads to poor retention—always include hands-on work.
! Adjust pace to slowest critical learner—lives may depend on their competence.
