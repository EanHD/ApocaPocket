[SUMMARY]
Fundamental principles of heat transfer and energy conversion for building simple engines and heating systems.

[STEPS]
1. Understand the three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, radiation.
2. Learn the concept of work from expanding gases (piston principle).
3. Grasp thermal efficiency: no engine converts all heat to work (second law).
4. Apply insulation principles to reduce unwanted heat loss.
5. Design simple steam or hot-air engines using pressure differentials.

[WARNINGS]
! Pressurized vessels can explode—always include pressure relief.
! Burns from steam are more severe than from dry heat at the same temperature.
