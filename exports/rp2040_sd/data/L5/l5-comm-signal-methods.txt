[SUMMARY]
Using flags, mirrors, smoke, horns, and drums for long-distance communication without electronics.

[STEPS]
1. Establish a shared signal code (e.g., flag positions, drum patterns).
2. Use mirror signals (heliograph) for daytime line-of-sight communication up to 50+ km.
3. Use smoke signals with wet fuel for visible plumes; pre-agreed patterns.
4. Sound signals: horns, bells, drums carry 1-5 km depending on terrain.
5. Set up relay stations on hilltops for extended range communication chains.

[WARNINGS]
! Signals are visible to everyone—assume hostile observers.
! Weather (fog, wind) degrades both visual and audio signals.
