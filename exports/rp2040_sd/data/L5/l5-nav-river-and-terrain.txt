CAT: L5
SUB: navigation
TAGS: navigation,terrain,rivers,orientation
REGION: global
CONFIDENCE: high

[SUMMARY]
Using rivers, ridgelines, and terrain features as natural navigation aids.

[STEPS]
1. Rivers flow downhill to larger water bodies—follow downstream to find settlements.
2. Use ridgelines for vantage points to identify landmarks and plan routes.
3. Read terrain: valleys funnel travel, saddles provide passes between peaks.
4. Note vegetation patterns: different growth on north vs. south slopes.
5. Use terrain association: match surrounding features to map to confirm position.

[WARNINGS]
! Following rivers into gorges or rapids can be dangerous—scout ahead.
! Terrain features can look similar—use multiple landmarks for confirmation.
