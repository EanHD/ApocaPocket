[SUMMARY]
Organizing reliable human messenger and relay networks for communication across distances.

[STEPS]
1. Establish relay stations at intervals matching a runner's/rider's sustainable range.
2. Use sealed, tamper-evident message containers.
3. Implement authentication tokens so recipients can verify messenger identity.
4. Maintain backup routes in case primary paths are compromised.
5. Log all messages sent and received for accountability.

[WARNINGS]
! Messengers can be intercepted—use encryption for sensitive content.
! Single points of failure in relay chains disable the whole network.
