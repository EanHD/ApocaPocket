[SUMMARY]
Sand casting technique for reproducing metal parts using reusable patterns and sand molds.

[STEPS]
1. Create a pattern of the desired part from wood or existing object.
2. Pack greensand (sand + clay + water) around the pattern in a two-part flask (cope and drag).
3. Remove the pattern, cut gates and risers for metal flow and air escape.
4. Melt metal in a crucible furnace and pour into the mold cavity.
5. Allow to cool, break out casting, and finish by filing and grinding.

[WARNINGS]
! Molten metal is extremely dangerous—wear full protective gear.
! Moisture in the mold causes steam explosions—dry sand thoroughly.
