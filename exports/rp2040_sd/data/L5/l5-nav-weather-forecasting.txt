[SUMMARY]
Predicting weather changes using cloud types, wind shifts, and natural indicators.

[STEPS]
1. Learn cloud types: cirrus (high, fair) → cirrostratus (halo) → approaching front.
2. Cumulus building vertically (cumulonimbus) signals thunderstorms in 2-4 hours.
3. Wind shifting clockwise (veering) often means improving weather; counter-clockwise (backing) means deteriorating.
4. Observe animal behavior: birds flying low, insects staying near ground suggest low pressure.
5. Build a simple barometer: sealed jar with water tube—rising water = falling pressure = incoming storm.

[WARNINGS]
! Local terrain (mountains, coasts) modifies large-scale weather patterns.
! Don't rely on single indicators—use multiple signs for reliable forecasts.
