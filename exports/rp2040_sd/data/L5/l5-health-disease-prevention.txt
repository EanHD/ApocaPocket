[SUMMARY]
Basic epidemiological principles for preventing disease outbreaks in community settings.

[STEPS]
1. Enforce handwashing with soap or ash before eating and after latrine use.
2. Isolate sick individuals promptly; designate a quarantine area.
3. Boil or treat all drinking water from uncertain sources.
4. Bury or burn animal carcasses and medical waste away from living areas.
5. Track illness patterns to identify outbreaks early.

[WARNINGS]
! Diarrheal disease kills through dehydration—treat with oral rehydration solution immediately.
! Airborne diseases require physical separation, not just hygiene.
