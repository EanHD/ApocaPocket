[SUMMARY]
Principles of fluid flow for designing water systems, hydraulic presses, and simple pumps.

[STEPS]
1. Understand pressure = force / area and how it transmits through fluids (Pascal's principle).
2. Calculate flow rate: cross-sectional area × velocity.
3. Apply gravity-fed systems: 1 meter of head ≈ 9.8 kPa (1.42 psi) pressure.
4. Build simple pumps: piston pump, rope pump, or ram pump for water lifting.
5. Minimize friction losses with smooth, large-diameter pipes and few bends.

[WARNINGS]
! Water hammer from sudden valve closure can burst pipes.
! Ensure intake screens to prevent debris from jamming pumps.
