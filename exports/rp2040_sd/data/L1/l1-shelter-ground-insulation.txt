[SUMMARY]
You lose heat to the ground 50× faster than to air because the ground conducts heat away by direct contact. Ground insulation is more important than a blanket in cold conditions. Without it, no amount of covering keeps you warm.

[STEPS]
1. R-VALUE CONCEPT: R-value measures thermal resistance. Higher = better insulation. Bare ground = R-0. You need R-5 minimum for comfort at 0°C, R-8+ below -10°C. A commercial sleeping pad provides R-2 to R-7. You need to match or exceed this with natural materials.
2. LEAF/DEBRIS BED: pile DRY leaves, pine needles, or dry grass 12-18 inches deep (compresses to 4-6 inches when you lie on it). This provides approximately R-5 to R-8 depending on material and compression. More is better — you cannot have too much ground insulation. Pile it between two logs to prevent spreading.
3. BOUGH BED: lay evergreen boughs (spruce, fir, pine) in overlapping layers like shingles, tips pointing toward your feet, butts into the ground. 6-8 inches of compressed boughs provides R-4 to R-6. The resin also repels moisture. This smells fantastic.
4. GRASS BUNDLE MATTRESS: bundle long grass into tight rolls 4-6 inches diameter. Lay bundles side by side to form a mattress. Better compression resistance than loose material. R-value: approximately R-3 to R-5 depending on density.
5. DRY BARK: flat bark slabs (particularly from dead conifers) laid over the ground surface provide both R-value and moisture barrier. Layer several pieces. R-value: approximately R-1 per inch of bark.
6. COMBINED SYSTEM (best): bark slab moisture barrier on ground → 6 inches of dry debris → bough layer on top. Total R-value: R-8 to R-12. This rivals commercial sleeping pads and air mattresses.
7. HOT ROCK BED (cold weather technique): heat large flat rocks in the fire for 1-2 hours. Scrape coals aside, lay rocks in a sleeping-body-length area. Cover with 4-6 inches of dirt. Place your insulation bed on top. The rocks radiate heat upward for 6-8 hours. Test with your hand — if you can hold it on the dirt layer comfortably, it's safe.
8. EMERGENCY MINIMUM: even sitting on a backpack, pile of rope, or folded tarp is dramatically better than sitting on bare ground. Any barrier reduces conductive heat loss. In an emergency, sit on anything available.

[WARNINGS]
! The #1 mistake in survival shelters is insufficient ground insulation — people focus on roof and walls while the ground steals their body heat all night
! Damp insulation materials lose most of their insulating value — keep your ground bed DRY
! If you're already hypothermic, ground insulation is more important than fire — get off the cold ground immediately
! Snow is an insulator (R-1 per inch) but you must have a barrier between you and snow or it melts from body heat, soaking you and making things worse
