[SUMMARY]
Emergency response for choking and airway obstruction in adults, children, and infants.

[STEPS]
1. Ask 'Are you choking?' — if patient can cough forcefully, encourage continued coughing.
2. For conscious adult/child: perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver).
3. Stand behind patient, fist above navel, thrust inward and upward.
4. For infants (<1 year): alternate 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts.
5. If patient becomes unconscious, lower to ground and begin CPR.
6. Check mouth for visible object before each rescue breath.

[WARNINGS]
! Do not perform blind finger sweeps — may push object deeper.
! Abdominal thrusts can cause internal injury — patient should be evaluated afterward.
! For pregnant or obese individuals, use chest thrusts instead of abdominal.
