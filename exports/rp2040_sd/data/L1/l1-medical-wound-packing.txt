[SUMMARY]
Wound packing is the primary technique for controlling life-threatening bleeding from junctional wounds (groin, armpit, neck) and deep lacerations where tourniquets cannot be applied. Pack within 3 minutes — blood loss kills fast.

[STEPS]
1. Expose the wound completely — cut or tear away clothing. You must see the source of bleeding.
2. If available, use hemostatic gauze (QuikClot, Celox). If not, use the cleanest cloth available — torn cotton shirts, gauze, sanitary pads, even a clean sock.
3. Using your fingers, push packing material DIRECTLY into the wound cavity, pressing firmly against the bleeding source. Start at the deepest point of the wound.
4. Continue feeding material into the wound in a zigzag pattern, maintaining firm pressure with your fingers as you pack. Fill the ENTIRE wound cavity tightly.
5. A deep groin or armpit wound may require 3-5 feet of gauze or equivalent cloth strips. Keep packing until the wound is completely filled and firm.
6. Once packed, apply direct pressure with both hands on top of the packing for a MINIMUM of 3 minutes (5+ minutes is better). Do not peek.
7. After holding pressure, apply a pressure dressing over the packing — wrap tightly with elastic bandage, belt, or torn cloth strips. It should be tight enough to maintain pressure but not cut off circulation below.
8. Monitor patient for shock: pale skin, rapid weak pulse, confusion, rapid breathing. Lay patient flat, elevate legs 12 inches if no spinal injury suspected.
9. Document time of packing — this information is critical for medical personnel who will eventually treat the wound.

[WARNINGS]
! This is for LIFE-THREATENING bleeding only — spurting blood, blood pooling on ground, or blood-soaked clothing
! Do not remove packing once placed — this dislodges forming clots and restarts hemorrhage
! Wound packing is extremely painful — warn the patient and do it anyway. Pain is survivable; blood loss is not
! Abdominal evisceration (organs visible): do NOT pack. Cover with moist clean cloth and evacuate.
! If blood soaks through, pack MORE material on top — never remove the first layer
