[SUMMARY]
Identifying dehydration and preparing oral rehydration solutions in the field.

[STEPS]
1. Recognize signs: thirst, dark urine, dry mouth, dizziness, sunken eyes, skin tenting.
2. Prepare ORS: 1 liter clean water + 6 teaspoons sugar + 1/2 teaspoon salt.
3. Administer small frequent sips — do not gulp large amounts.
4. For children: 50-100 mL per episode of vomiting/diarrhea.
5. Continue normal food intake when tolerated.
6. Monitor urine output — goal is clear to light yellow urine.

[WARNINGS]
! Severe dehydration (unconscious, unable to drink) requires IV fluids — oral alone insufficient.
! Incorrect ORS ratios can worsen condition — measure carefully.
! Vomiting and diarrhea combined cause rapid dehydration, especially in children.
