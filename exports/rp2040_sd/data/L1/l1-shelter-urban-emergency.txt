[SUMMARY]
Finding and creating emergency shelter in urban and suburban environments.

[STEPS]
1. Prioritize intact structures: parking garages, stairwells, basements, shipping containers.
2. Avoid damaged structures — aftershocks and structural collapse risk.
3. Use vehicles as temporary shelter — good wind protection but poor insulation.
4. Create insulation from cardboard, newspaper, carpet, curtains — layer everything.
5. Seal windows/doors with plastic sheeting and tape for wind protection.
6. For chemical/nuclear threats: go to interior room, upper floors; seal all openings.

[WARNINGS]
! Structurally damaged buildings can collapse without warning.
! Underground shelters may flood or accumulate toxic gases.
! Running vehicles in enclosed spaces causes carbon monoxide poisoning.
! Urban areas may have looters/hostile individuals — security awareness essential.
