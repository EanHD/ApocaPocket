[SUMMARY]
Field suturing techniques for wound closure when no medical facility is available. Only close wounds that are clean, less than 6 hours old, and not caused by bites or contaminated objects.

[STEPS]
1. Sterilize needle by holding in flame until red-hot (10 seconds), then cooling in boiled water or alcohol. Fishing hooks with barb filed off work as curved needles.
2. Thread: use fishing line (monofilament 2-4 lb test), dental floss, or thin unwaxed thread. Boil thread for 10 minutes or soak in alcohol/iodine for 5 minutes.
3. Clean wound thoroughly with boiled cooled water or dilute iodine solution. Remove all debris. Irrigate with pressure using a squeeze bottle or syringe if available.
4. Simple interrupted stitch: insert needle 3-5mm from wound edge, pass through one side, across the gap, and up through the other side at equal depth (3-5mm deep).
5. Tie square knot (left-over-right, then right-over-left). Pull edges together until they just touch — do NOT overtighten or tissue will die.
6. Space stitches 5-7mm apart. Most field wounds need 3-8 stitches.
7. Alternative — butterfly closure: cut adhesive tape into hourglass shapes, apply across wound edges to hold them together. Safer than suturing.
8. Cover with clean dressing. Change dressing daily. Watch for redness spreading >1cm from edges, pus, red streaks, or fever — all signs of infection requiring stitch removal.
9. Remove stitches in 7-10 days (face: 5 days, trunk: 10 days, joints: 14 days). Cut thread next to knot and pull through.

[WARNINGS]
! NEVER suture a wound that is infected, contaminated, or more than 6 hours old — this traps bacteria and causes life-threatening infection
! Bite wounds (animal or human) must NEVER be sutured closed — extremely high infection risk
! Abdominal or deep puncture wounds require evacuation, not field suturing
! Improvised suturing is a LAST RESORT — adhesive strips or butterfly closures are safer when available
! Unsterilized needles can cause tetanus, sepsis, and death
