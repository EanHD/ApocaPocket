[SUMMARY]
Temporary immobilization principles for suspected fractures.

[STEPS]
1. Check distal circulation/sensation before splinting.
2. Immobilize joint above and below injury.
3. Pad splint and secure without excessive constriction.
4. Reassess distal perfusion after securing.

[WARNINGS]
! Do not force realignment unless no pulse and trained to do so.
! Open fractures have high infection risk.
