[SUMMARY]
A penetrating chest wound that bubbles or hisses is a sucking chest wound — air enters the chest cavity and collapses the lung. Without a chest seal, tension pneumothorax develops and is fatal within minutes.

[STEPS]
1. IDENTIFY: look for a chest wound that bubbles, hisses, or sucks air on breathing. Blood froth at the wound. Patient will have severe difficulty breathing, anxiety, may be cyanotic (blue lips/fingertips).
2. SEAL IMMEDIATELY: use any airtight material — plastic packaging, credit card, duct tape, petroleum-jelly-soaked gauze, latex glove, plastic bag. The goal is an airtight seal over the wound.
3. THREE-SIDED SEAL (preferred): tape the plastic on three sides only, leaving the bottom edge open. This creates a flutter valve — air can escape on exhalation but cannot enter on inhalation. This prevents tension buildup.
4. If using commercial chest seal (Hyfin, Asherman): peel and stick directly over the wound. These have built-in one-way valves.
5. Have patient exhale forcefully as you apply the seal — this pushes air out of the chest cavity before sealing.
6. Position patient sitting upright (improves breathing mechanics) or on the injured side if they cannot sit.
7. Monitor continuously: if breathing worsens, neck veins distend, or patient becomes more confused — tension pneumothorax is developing. Briefly lift one corner of the seal to release trapped air (you'll hear/feel it escape), then reseal.
8. If two chest wounds (entry and exit), seal both. The larger wound is priority.
9. THIS IS A TEMPORARY MEASURE — patient needs definitive surgical care. Evacuate immediately.

[WARNINGS]
! Tension pneumothorax is IMMEDIATELY LIFE-THREATENING — act within seconds, not minutes
! If patient deteriorates after sealing (worsening breathing, distended neck veins, trachea shifting), you have tension buildup — lift one corner of the seal to release pressure ('burp' the seal), then reseal
! Check for EXIT wound — a bullet/object may have passed through. BOTH holes need sealing.
! Do not remove impaled objects from the chest — stabilize in place
