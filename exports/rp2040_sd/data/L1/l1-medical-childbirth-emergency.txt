[SUMMARY]
Assisting with emergency childbirth when medical facilities are unavailable.

[STEPS]
1. Create clean delivery area — wash hands, lay clean cloths/blankets.
2. Do not rush or pull the baby — support the head as it emerges.
3. Check for cord around neck — if loose, slip over head; if tight, clamp and cut.
4. After delivery, keep baby warm (skin-to-skin) and clear airway gently.
5. Clamp cord in two places (6 and 8 inches from baby), cut between with sterile blade.
6. Placenta will deliver in 5-30 minutes — do not pull on cord. Save placenta for medical evaluation.

[WARNINGS]
! Hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death — be prepared with clean cloths for pressure.
! Breech presentation (feet/buttocks first) is life-threatening — do not attempt to turn baby.
! If cord prolapses (comes before baby), position mother with hips elevated — this is critical emergency.
! Do not cut cord with unsterile instruments — infection risk is severe.
