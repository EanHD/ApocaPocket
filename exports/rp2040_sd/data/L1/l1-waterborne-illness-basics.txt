[SUMMARY]
Recognizing and responding to common waterborne illnesses in survival situations.

[STEPS]
1. Common symptoms: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever.
2. Begin oral rehydration immediately at first sign of diarrhea.
3. Isolate patient's waste — do not allow contamination of water sources.
4. Cholera signs: profuse watery 'rice water' diarrhea — life-threatening dehydration within hours.
5. Giardia: onset 1-2 weeks after exposure, foul-smelling diarrhea, bloating.
6. Maintain strict water treatment protocols for entire group.

[WARNINGS]
! Cholera and dysentery can kill through dehydration within hours — aggressive rehydration critical.
! Bloody diarrhea (dysentery) indicates invasive infection — antibiotics if available.
! Cryptosporidium resists chlorine — boiling or fine filtration required.
! One untreated case can contaminate water for entire group.
