[SUMMARY]
Managing dental emergencies including toothache, lost fillings, and knocked-out teeth.

[STEPS]
1. For toothache: rinse with warm saltwater; apply clove oil (eugenol) if available.
2. For lost filling: pack cavity with temporary dental cement, sugar-free gum, or candle wax.
3. For knocked-out tooth: handle by crown only, rinse gently, reinsert in socket or store in milk/saliva.
4. For abscess: rinse with warm saltwater frequently; antibiotics if available.
5. Control pain with ibuprofen or acetaminophen.
6. Avoid extraction unless tooth is severely infected and no antibiotics available.

[WARNINGS]
! Dental infections can spread to throat/brain and become life-threatening.
! Field extraction carries high risk of jaw fracture and hemorrhage.
! Never place aspirin directly on gums — causes chemical burns.
