[SUMMARY]
Designing shelters that shed rain while maintaining adequate ventilation.

[STEPS]
1. Angle roof at 45+ degrees for effective rain runoff.
2. Overlap roofing materials (leaves, bark, tarp) like shingles — start from bottom.
3. Extend roof edge beyond walls to create drip line away from shelter interior.
4. Dig drainage channel around shelter to divert water flow.
5. Leave ventilation gaps near top — warm moist air rises and must escape.
6. Ground insulation is critical in rain — elevate sleeping area above ground moisture.

[WARNINGS]
! Fully sealed shelters without ventilation cause dangerous condensation buildup.
! Flash flooding can occur in low areas — never shelter in dry riverbeds.
! Wet clothing and bedding cause hypothermia even in mild temperatures.
