[SUMMARY]
Rain and snow make fire starting dramatically harder. Success requires finding dry fuel sources, creating a dry platform, using a top-down fire lay, and protecting the fire from wind and precipitation during the critical ignition phase.

[STEPS]
1. DRY TINDER SOURCES (even in rain): birch bark (waterproof outer layer), dead standing grass/weeds, inner bark of dead cedar/juniper (shred finely), pine resin lumps, fatwood (resin-saturated pine heartwood from stumps), dead fern fronds under tree canopy, pocket lint, vaseline-soaked cotton balls (carry these in your kit).
2. DRY KINDLING: snap dead twigs off standing trees — they're drier than ground wood. Split larger sticks to expose dry inner wood. Pencil-thick and thinner. You need at least TWO large handfuls.
3. DRY FUEL WOOD: standing dead trees and large dead branches still attached to trees. Split logs in half or quarters — the interior is dry even if the exterior is soaked. Batoning (splitting wood with a knife and baton stick) is essential in wet conditions.
4. BUILD A PLATFORM: lay 3-4 arm-thick green logs side by side on wet/snowy ground. Build your fire ON this platform. This prevents ground moisture from wicking up and killing the fire.
5. WIND PROTECTION: build fire against a rock face, log wall, or bank. Or construct a quick wind screen from stacked logs or leaned branches. In snow, dig a pit to below-wind level.
6. TOP-DOWN FIRE LAY: lay largest fuel on platform first (wrist-thick pieces), then medium kindling perpendicular on top, then small kindling, then tinder on the very top. Light the tinder. Fire burns downward, drying each layer before igniting it. This is the most reliable wet-weather technique.
7. FEATHER STICKS: using a knife, shave long thin curls on a dry stick without detaching them. Create 3-5 feather sticks with 15-20 curls each. These catch flame from even weak ignition sources and are the bridge between tinder and kindling.
8. IGNITION: ferro rod is most reliable wet-weather ignition (works when wet, thousands of strikes). Aim sparks into a nest of fine birch bark shavings or fatwood scrapings. Waterproof matches second choice. Lighters fail in cold.
9. Once flame is established, shelter it from rain with your body or a bark slab overhead. Feed kindling slowly — don't smother the young fire. Gradually increase fuel size over 5-10 minutes.
10. SNOW SPECIFIC: fire on snow requires a platform of green logs or flat rocks. Dig fire pit to ground level if snow is less than 3 feet deep. Melt snow for water only in a pot near fire — eating snow lowers core body temperature.

[WARNINGS]
! Hypothermia kills faster than hunger or thirst — getting a fire going in wet/cold conditions is a life-or-death skill
! Wet firewood creates excessive smoke and creosote — ventilate your shelter to prevent carbon monoxide buildup
! Never use gasoline or liquid accelerants on a fire — explosive vapor causes severe burns
! Standing dead wood is almost always drier than anything on the ground — look up, not down
