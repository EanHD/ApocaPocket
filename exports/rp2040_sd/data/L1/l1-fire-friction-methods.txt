[SUMMARY]
Starting fire using friction-based methods: bow drill, hand drill, and fire plough.

[STEPS]
1. Bow drill: carve fireboard, spindle, handhold, and bow from dry wood.
2. Cut V-notch in fireboard; place tinder bundle beneath notch.
3. Wrap bow string around spindle; press handhold on top, saw bow back and forth.
4. Hand drill: roll straight, dry spindle between palms on fireboard — requires sustained effort.
5. Fire plough: rub hardwood shaft along groove in softer wood baseboard.
6. Once ember forms in tinder bundle, gently blow into flame.

[WARNINGS]
! Friction fire requires completely dry materials — nearly impossible in wet conditions.
! Hand drill method causes palm blisters — protect hands.
! Practice these techniques before a survival situation — failure rate is high for beginners.
