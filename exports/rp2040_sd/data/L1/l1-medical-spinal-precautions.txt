[SUMMARY]
Handling suspected spinal cord injuries to prevent paralysis in field conditions.

[STEPS]
1. Suspect spinal injury in: falls, vehicle accidents, diving injuries, blunt head trauma.
2. Tell the patient to stay still — do not move them unless immediate danger.
3. Manually stabilize head and neck in neutral position (inline stabilization).
4. If patient must be moved, use log-roll technique with 3+ people.
5. Improvise cervical collar from SAM splint, rolled towel, or clothing.
6. Monitor airway — if vomiting occurs, log-roll to side maintaining alignment.

[WARNINGS]
! Moving a patient with spinal injury can cause permanent paralysis.
! Absence of pain does not rule out spinal injury — mechanism matters.
! Helmet removal requires two-person technique to maintain alignment.
! If CPR is needed, airway management takes priority over spinal precautions.
