[SUMMARY]
Three fires in a triangle is the international distress signal. A signal fire must produce maximum contrast against the environment — dark smoke against a light sky, bright flame at night. Preparation before the rescue aircraft arrives is critical — you may only have seconds to light.

[STEPS]
1. THREE-FIRE TRIANGLE: build three fire sites in an equilateral triangle, 50-100 feet between each. This is the international distress pattern recognized by all search-and-rescue. Build each fire ready to light in seconds — tinder, kindling, and fuel pre-staged.
2. DAYTIME SMOKE: maximize smoke contrast against the sky. Against blue/clear sky: use green branches, wet leaves, moss, rubber, or oil to produce DARK/BLACK smoke. Against overcast/gray sky: use dry grass, birch bark, or pine needles to produce WHITE/LIGHT smoke.
3. NIGHTTIME FIRE: maximize brightness. Dry hardwood produces bright sustained flame. Build fires on elevated ground, hilltops, or clearings visible from the air. A fire is visible 3-10 miles from the air depending on size.
4. RAPID IGNITION: keep signal fires covered with bark or a tarp to stay dry. Place a fist-sized ball of petroleum-jelly cotton or fatwood shavings at the base of each fire for instant ignition. Practice lighting and timing — you need all three fires burning within 60 seconds of hearing an aircraft.
5. PLATFORM FIRES: in wet conditions or snow, build signal fires on platforms (raised log frames). This keeps the fire above moisture and makes it visible at greater distance.
6. SMOKE COLUMN CONTROL: a tall, straight smoke column is more visible than dispersed smoke. Build a chimney effect by surrounding the fire with a ring of stacked rocks or logs with gaps at the bottom for air. The column can be visible 15+ miles on a calm day.
7. GROUND-TO-AIR SIGNALS: supplement fires with ground markers — stamp letters in snow, arrange rocks/logs to spell SOS or V (need assistance) in 10+ foot letters. These are visible from search aircraft even when fires can't be maintained.
8. TIMING: listen for aircraft. Most searches use grid patterns — the aircraft will pass again. If you hear an engine, light ALL signal fires immediately and add green material for smoke. Stand in the open and wave a brightly colored item overhead.

[WARNINGS]
! A signal fire that gets out of control can destroy your shelter and supplies — clear a 10-foot firebreak around each signal fire
! Green branches for smoke can produce toxic fumes — stay upwind
! Mirror signaling is visible further than fire in daylight (up to 50 miles) — use mirror first if available
! Three of anything is the universal distress signal — three fires, three gunshots, three whistle blasts
