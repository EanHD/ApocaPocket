[SUMMARY]
How to identify and provide first aid for shock (hypovolemic, neurogenic, anaphylactic).

[STEPS]
1. Recognize signs: pale/cool/clammy skin, rapid weak pulse, rapid breathing, confusion, anxiety.
2. Treat the underlying cause (stop bleeding, treat allergic reaction, etc.).
3. Lay patient flat and elevate legs 8-12 inches (unless spinal/head injury suspected).
4. Keep patient warm with blankets or clothing — prevent heat loss.
5. Do not give food or water if surgery may be needed.
6. Monitor breathing and consciousness continuously; be ready for CPR.

[WARNINGS]
! Shock is life-threatening — even if patient seems stable, condition can deteriorate rapidly.
! Do not elevate legs if head, spine, or leg injury is suspected.
! Internal bleeding causes shock without visible blood loss.
