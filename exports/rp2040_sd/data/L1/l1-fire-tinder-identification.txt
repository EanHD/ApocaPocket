[SUMMARY]
Identifying and preparing natural tinder materials for fire starting.

[STEPS]
1. Best natural tinders: dry grass, birch bark, cedar bark (shredded), cattail fluff, fatwood.
2. Collect tinder in dry conditions and store in waterproof container.
3. Process tinder by shredding, scraping, or fluffing to increase surface area.
4. Create a bird's nest shape with tinder bundle — loose center, tighter outside.
5. Char cloth (cotton burned without air) catches sparks easily — prepare in advance.
6. Pine resin and dried sap are excellent fire extenders to add to tinder bundles.

[WARNINGS]
! Damp tinder will not ignite — always carry backup dry tinder.
! Some tree barks (like poison ivy vines) release toxic smoke — identify correctly.
! Fatwood contains flammable resin — burns hot, keep away from face.
