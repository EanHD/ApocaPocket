[SUMMARY]
Field hypothermia triage and safe rewarming priorities.

[STEPS]
1. Move patient out of wind/wet exposure.
2. Replace wet clothing and insulate head/torso.
3. Apply gradual external warming to trunk.
4. Monitor mental status and shivering response.

[WARNINGS]
! Rapid peripheral rewarming may worsen instability.
! Severe hypothermia needs advanced medical care.
