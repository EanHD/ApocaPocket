[SUMMARY]
Emergency management of venomous and non-venomous snakebites in field conditions.

[STEPS]
1. Move away from the snake; do not attempt to capture or kill it.
2. Keep patient calm and still — movement increases venom spread.
3. Remove rings, watches, tight clothing near the bite (swelling will occur).
4. Immobilize the bitten limb at or below heart level.
5. Mark the edge of swelling with pen and time to track progression.
6. Evacuate to medical facility for antivenom as soon as possible.

[WARNINGS]
! Do NOT cut the wound, suck venom, apply tourniquet, or use ice.
! Pressure immobilization bandage only for neurotoxic snakes (e.g., coral snakes, cobras).
! Even 'dry bites' (no venom) can become infected — monitor all bites.
! Identification of snake species helps treatment — photograph if safely possible.
