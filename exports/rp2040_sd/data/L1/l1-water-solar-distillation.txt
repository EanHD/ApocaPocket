[SUMMARY]
Building a solar still to extract water from soil, vegetation, or contaminated sources.

[STEPS]
1. Dig a hole 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep in a sunny location.
2. Place a collection container in the center of the hole.
3. Add green vegetation or contaminated water around the container (not in it).
4. Cover the hole with clear plastic sheet, seal edges with soil/rocks.
5. Place a small stone in the center of the plastic directly above the container.
6. Water evaporates, condenses on plastic, drips into container. Expect 0.5-1 liter per day.

[WARNINGS]
! Solar stills produce small amounts of water — supplement with other methods.
! Energy spent building may exceed water gained in some conditions.
! Plastic sheet is essential — no effective substitute exists.
