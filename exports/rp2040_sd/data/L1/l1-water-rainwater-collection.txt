[SUMMARY]
Methods for collecting and storing rainwater for drinking and use.

[STEPS]
1. Use any clean, non-toxic surface as catchment (tarp, plastic sheet, clean roof).
2. Angle catchment surface to direct water into collection container.
3. Let first few minutes of rain flush contaminants from surface before collecting.
4. Use multiple containers to maximize collection during rain events.
5. Filter collected water through cloth to remove debris.
6. Treat collected water (boil or chemically disinfect) before drinking.

[WARNINGS]
! Rooftop runoff may contain bird droppings, chemicals, or heavy metals — always treat.
! Standing rainwater breeds mosquitoes — cover containers.
! First flush from any surface is the most contaminated — discard it.
