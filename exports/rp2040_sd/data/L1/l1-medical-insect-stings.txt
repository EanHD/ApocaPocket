[SUMMARY]
Managing dangerous insect stings and bites including bees, spiders, scorpions, and ticks.

[STEPS]
1. Remove stinger by scraping sideways (do not squeeze with tweezers).
2. Clean bite/sting site with soap and water.
3. Apply cold compress to reduce swelling and pain.
4. For ticks: grasp close to skin with fine tweezers, pull straight out steadily.
5. Monitor for systemic reactions (spreading rash, fever, difficulty breathing).
6. Administer antihistamine for local reactions; epinephrine for anaphylaxis.

[WARNINGS]
! Watch for anaphylaxis signs with ANY sting — can occur even without prior reaction history.
! Black widow and brown recluse spider bites require medical attention.
! Tick bites can transmit Lyme disease and other infections — save tick for identification.
! Multiple stings can cause systemic toxicity even without allergy.
