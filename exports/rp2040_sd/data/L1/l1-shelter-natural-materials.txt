[SUMMARY]
Building emergency shelters from natural materials found in the environment.

[STEPS]
1. Lean-to: prop ridgepole against tree/rock, lean branches at 45°, layer with leaves/debris.
2. Debris hut: create A-frame ridgepole at body height, layer ribs, pile debris 2-3 feet thick.
3. Smaller is warmer — size shelter just large enough to fit inside.
4. Layer roofing material from bottom up (like shingles) for water runoff.
5. Fill interior floor with dry leaves, grass, or pine needles for insulation.
6. Block entrance with stuffed pack or debris door.

[WARNINGS]
! Check overhead for dead branches ('widow makers') before building under trees.
! Debris shelters are not waterproof unless materials are very thick and layered correctly.
! Insects and small animals inhabit debris piles — shake materials before use.
