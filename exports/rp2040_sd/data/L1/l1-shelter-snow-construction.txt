[SUMMARY]
Building emergency snow shelters for cold weather survival.

[STEPS]
1. Quinzhee: pile snow into mound 6+ feet high; let sinter (harden) for 1-2 hours.
2. Insert sticks 12 inches deep as thickness guides; hollow out interior until sticks appear.
3. Snow cave: dig into deep, stable snowbank (not avalanche-prone slope).
4. Create entrance lower than sleeping platform — cold air sinks, warm air stays.
5. Poke ventilation hole in roof with stick — maintain this hole at all times.
6. Smooth interior ceiling to prevent dripping; insulate floor with boughs or pad.

[WARNINGS]
! Ventilation hole is life-critical — carbon dioxide and CO accumulate in sealed snow shelters.
! Avalanche risk: never build in or below avalanche terrain.
! Getting wet during construction causes dangerous heat loss — work in layers, avoid sweating.
! Mark shelter entrance visibly — snow shelters are invisible from outside.
