[SUMMARY]
Using lenses and reflective surfaces to start fire from sunlight.

[STEPS]
1. Magnifying lens: focus sunlight to smallest possible point on dark-colored tinder.
2. Eyeglasses (farsighted/reading only): hold at focal distance to concentrate light.
3. Parabolic reflector: polish bottom of aluminum can with clay/chocolate, focus at center point.
4. Water-filled clear plastic bag or bottle can serve as improvised lens.
5. Ice lens: shape clear ice into convex lens shape — works in freezing sunny conditions.
6. Hold steady and be patient — may take 30-60 seconds for ignition.

[WARNINGS]
! Requires direct, strong sunlight — ineffective on cloudy days or at dawn/dusk.
! Never look through lens at the sun — instant eye damage.
! Nearsighted (concave) lenses will not focus light to a point.
