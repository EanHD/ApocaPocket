[SUMMARY]
Preventing wound infections in austere environments without access to hospitals.

[STEPS]
1. Clean all wounds thoroughly as soon as possible (see wound cleaning entry).
2. Apply antiseptic (dilute iodine, honey, or boiled saltwater if nothing else available).
3. Keep wounds covered with clean, dry dressings; change daily.
4. Watch for infection signs: increasing redness, swelling, warmth, pus, red streaks, fever.
5. Elevate injured extremities when possible to reduce swelling.
6. If antibiotics are available and infection develops, begin appropriate course.

[WARNINGS]
! Untreated wound infections can become sepsis — a life-threatening emergency.
! Do not close contaminated or bite wounds — leave open to drain.
! Tetanus risk increases with dirty/puncture wounds — prior vaccination critical.
