[SUMMARY]
Thermal survival depends more on moisture/wind control than shelter size.

[STEPS]
1. Select site above runoff paths and away from widowmakers.
2. Build windbreak and ground insulation first.
3. Minimize internal volume while preserving ventilation.
4. Layer dry insulating materials and maintain them.

[WARNINGS]
! Poor ventilation can cause CO buildup if heating inside.
! Wet insulation rapidly loses effectiveness.
