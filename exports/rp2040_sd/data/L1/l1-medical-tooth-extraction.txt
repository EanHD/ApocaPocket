[SUMMARY]
Dental infections and abscesses can become life-threatening (Ludwig's angina, sepsis) without treatment. When no dentist is available, extraction of a severely infected tooth may be necessary. This is a LAST RESORT procedure.

[STEPS]
1. MANAGE PAIN FIRST: maximum dose ibuprofen (400mg) + acetaminophen (1000mg) taken together. Apply clove oil (eugenol) directly to the tooth and gum — this is a potent dental anesthetic. If available, inject lidocaine around the tooth base.
2. If an abscess is present (swollen gum, pus, throbbing pain): attempt drainage first. Using a sterilized blade (flame-sterilized), lance the most swollen/fluctuant point. Let pus drain. Rinse with warm salt water. This may resolve the emergency without extraction.
3. LOOSENING: using a thin, strong flat tool (small flathead screwdriver, dental elevator, sturdy knife tip), work between the tooth and the gum socket on all sides. Rock the tool gently to expand the socket and sever the periodontal ligament. This takes 5-10 minutes of patient, gentle work. Do NOT rush.
4. EXTRACTION: once significantly loosened, grip the tooth as low as possible (at the gumline, not the crown) with pliers, vice-grips, or hemostats. Rock the tooth firmly but gently — forward, backward, rotate — gradually increasing range of motion. Pull with a twisting motion when the tooth is very mobile.
5. BLEEDING CONTROL: immediately bite down on a thick wad of clean gauze or cloth over the socket. Maintain firm pressure for 30-60 minutes without peeking. If available, pack socket with hemostatic gauze or place a wet tea bag (tannic acid promotes clotting).
6. AFTERCARE: do NOT spit, suck, or rinse for 24 hours (dislodges the blood clot causing 'dry socket'). After 24 hours, gentle warm salt water rinses (½ tsp salt per cup) after meals. Soft foods only. Continue anti-inflammatory medication for pain.
7. DRY SOCKET: if severe throbbing pain develops 2-3 days after extraction with foul taste, the clot was lost. Pack the socket with a small piece of gauze soaked in clove oil. This provides relief. Re-pack every 12-24 hours for 3-5 days.
8. ANTIBIOTICS: if available, amoxicillin 500mg every 8 hours for 7 days (or metronidazole 400mg every 8 hours if penicillin-allergic) for infected teeth.

[WARNINGS]
! Extraction carries risk of jaw fracture, hemorrhage, infection spread, and broken root tips — truly last resort
! NEVER extract teeth with pliers alone — the crushing force shatters the tooth. You need to loosen first.
! Uncontrolled dental bleeding can be life-threatening — have packing material ready
! If facial swelling extends below the jaw or causes difficulty swallowing/breathing, this is a life-threatening emergency (Ludwig's angina) — extraction alone may not be sufficient
