[SUMMARY]
Household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) is the most widely available chemical water disinfectant. Correct dosing depends on bleach concentration and water turbidity. Too little fails to kill pathogens; too much is toxic.

[STEPS]
1. Standard household bleach is 5-6% sodium hypochlorite. Some newer products are 8.25%. Check the label — dosing changes with concentration.
2. CLEAR WATER dosing (5-6% bleach): 2 drops per liter (8 drops per gallon). For 8.25% bleach: 2 drops per liter (6 drops per gallon).
3. CLOUDY/TURBID WATER dosing (5-6% bleach): 4 drops per liter (16 drops per gallon). For 8.25% bleach: 4 drops per liter (12 drops per gallon). Pre-filter turbid water through cloth first.
4. 1 drop ≈ 0.05ml. If using a cap: a standard bleach cap holds about 1 teaspoon (5ml) ≈ 100 drops. So 1/50th of a cap per liter for clear water.
5. After adding bleach, MIX thoroughly by stirring or shaking. Let stand for 30 MINUTES minimum before drinking.
6. After 30 minutes, water should have a slight chlorine smell. If no smell: add same dose again and wait another 15 minutes. If still no smell, the water may be too contaminated — boil instead.
7. Bulk treatment: for 5-gallon (19L) container of clear water, use ¼ teaspoon (about 40 drops) of 5-6% bleach.
8. Pool shock (calcium hypochlorite, 68%) for long-term storage: dissolve 1 heaping teaspoon in 2 gallons water to make stock solution (~500ppm). Then treat drinking water with this stock solution at same rate as bleach.
9. Temperature matters: at 25°C, 30 minutes contact time is sufficient. Below 10°C, use 60 minutes. Below 5°C, use 120 minutes or switch to boiling.
10. Record your dosing and source water location for future reference. Some sources need consistent treatment; others may indicate upstream contamination.

[WARNINGS]
! ONLY use unscented regular bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Never use color-safe, splashless, or scented bleach — these contain toxic additives
! Bleach loses potency over time — after 1 year at room temperature, concentration drops ~20%. After 2 years, consider it unreliable. Rotate stock.
! Bleach does NOT remove chemical contaminants, heavy metals, or radioactive particles — only biological pathogens
! Bleach is less effective in cold water (<10°C) — double the contact time
! If water has no slight chlorine smell after 30 minutes, repeat the dose — the organic matter consumed the chlorine
