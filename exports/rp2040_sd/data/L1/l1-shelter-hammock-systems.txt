[SUMMARY]
Setting up hammock and elevated shelter systems for wet or insect-heavy environments.

[STEPS]
1. Select two strong, living trees 10-15 feet apart.
2. Hang hammock with tree-friendly straps — not thin cord that damages bark.
3. Add tarp/rainfly above in catenary curve — ridge line slightly above hammock.
4. Add underquilt or pad beneath hammock — bottom insulation critical (compressed insulation = none).
5. Bug net is essential in tropical/wet environments — tuck fully around hammock.
6. Test height and strength before full weight — hang low enough that falls are safe.

[WARNINGS]
! Dead trees and dead branches can fall on elevated sleepers.
! Bottom insulation is essential — cold air circulates under hammock, causing hypothermia.
! Hammock failure drops you to ground — always check attachment points.
