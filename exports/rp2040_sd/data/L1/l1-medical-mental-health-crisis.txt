[SUMMARY]
Providing psychological first aid during and after crisis situations.

[STEPS]
1. Ensure physical safety first — psychological care follows physical stabilization.
2. Approach calmly, introduce yourself, ask how you can help.
3. Listen actively without judgment — do not force people to talk about trauma.
4. Help with immediate practical needs (water, food, shelter, family contact).
5. Provide accurate information about the situation — uncertainty increases distress.
6. Watch for danger signs: suicidal statements, complete withdrawal, inability to care for self.

[WARNINGS]
! Do not say 'everything will be fine' or minimize the crisis.
! Critical incident stress debriefing (forced retelling) can worsen trauma — avoid it.
! Suicidal individuals need constant supervision — remove access to means of self-harm.
! Caregiver burnout is real — responders need support too.
