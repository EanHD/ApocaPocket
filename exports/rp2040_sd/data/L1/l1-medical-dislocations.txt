[SUMMARY]
Dislocations occur when a bone is forced out of its joint socket. Shoulders and fingers are most common. Field reduction (putting the joint back) should only be attempted when medical care is unavailable — improper technique can cause nerve and blood vessel damage.

[STEPS]
1. SHOULDER — Cunningham technique (safest field method): have patient sit upright in a chair. Massage the trapezius (upper back/neck muscle) firmly for 2-3 minutes to relax spasm. Then massage the deltoid (shoulder cap) for 2-3 minutes. Then massage the bicep for 2-3 minutes. While massaging, ask patient to slowly shrug shoulders up toward ears and pull shoulder blades together. The shoulder often self-reduces during this sequence.
2. SHOULDER — External rotation method: patient lies on back. Elbow bent to 90°. Slowly rotate forearm outward (palm toward ceiling) while keeping elbow against the body. Move very slowly — 2-3 minutes to reach full external rotation. The head of the humerus slides back into the socket. Stop if patient reports sharp increase in pain.
3. SHOULDER — Stimson technique: patient lies face-down on elevated surface (table, log) with affected arm hanging straight down. Hang 5-10 lbs weight from the wrist (water bottle in a bag). Wait 15-30 minutes. Gravity and muscle relaxation do the work. Safest method — lowest force.
4. AFTER SHOULDER REDUCTION: immediate sling-and-swath (arm against chest, bound to torso). Keep immobilized for 2-3 weeks. The joint is unstable and will re-dislocate easily.
5. FINGER DISLOCATION: usually obvious — finger bent at wrong angle. Grasp the dislocated segment firmly. Pull steady traction along the axis of the finger while gently guiding it back into alignment. You'll feel/hear a 'clunk' as it seats. Buddy-tape to adjacent finger for 2-3 weeks.
6. Check circulation after any reduction: pulse present, skin color normal, sensation intact, can wiggle fingers/toes. If circulation is compromised before reduction, that's actually an indication to attempt reduction urgently — the joint is compressing blood vessels.

[WARNINGS]
! NEVER attempt field reduction if you suspect a fracture near the joint — this can cause catastrophic nerve/vessel damage
! Shoulder reduction should ideally be done within 1-2 hours — muscle spasm increases over time making reduction progressively harder
! Check pulse, sensation, and movement BEFORE and AFTER any reduction attempt
! If the joint will not reduce with gentle sustained traction in 2-3 attempts, STOP — splint in position found and evacuate
