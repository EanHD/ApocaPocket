[SUMMARY]
Emergency treatment for eye injuries including foreign bodies, chemical exposure, and trauma.

[STEPS]
1. For chemical exposure: flush eye immediately with clean water for 15-20 minutes.
2. For foreign body: pull upper lid over lower lid; blink repeatedly in clean water.
3. Do not rub the eye or attempt to remove embedded objects.
4. For blunt trauma: apply cold compress gently; do not apply pressure to eyeball.
5. Cover injured eye with rigid shield (cup, cut-out bottom); patch both eyes to reduce movement.
6. Seek advanced medical care — eye injuries risk permanent vision loss.

[WARNINGS]
! Never attempt to remove objects embedded in the eye.
! Chemical burns to eyes are time-critical — flush IMMEDIATELY, before anything else.
! Patching only the injured eye causes continued movement — patch both for stabilization.
