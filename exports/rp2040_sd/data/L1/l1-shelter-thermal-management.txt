[SUMMARY]
Strategies for retaining body heat in cold conditions without external heat sources.

[STEPS]
1. Insulate from ground first — ground steals heat 25x faster than air.
2. Layer clothing: wicking base, insulating middle, wind/waterproof outer.
3. Keep dry — wet insulation loses up to 90% of insulating value.
4. Minimize shelter volume — smaller space retains body heat better.
5. Huddle with others — shared body heat significantly increases warmth.
6. Heat rocks near fire, wrap in cloth, place in shelter or sleeping bag (not hot enough to burn).

[WARNINGS]
! Cotton kills — wet cotton provides zero insulation and accelerates heat loss.
! Do not sleep directly on cold ground — hypothermia risk even in above-freezing temperatures.
! Tight clothing restricts circulation and reduces warmth — layers should be loose.
