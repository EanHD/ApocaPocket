[SUMMARY]
Selecting appropriate fuel wood by type, moisture content, and intended use.

[STEPS]
1. Gather wood in stages: tinder → kindling (pencil-thin) → fuel (wrist-thick) → large logs.
2. Use standing dead wood — driest available. Avoid wood from the ground (absorbs moisture).
3. Softwoods (pine, cedar) ignite easily but burn fast with more smoke — good for starting.
4. Hardwoods (oak, maple, hickory) burn longer and hotter — best for sustained fire.
5. Test dryness: dry wood snaps cleanly, feels light, sounds hollow when knocked together.
6. Split larger pieces to expose dry interior wood in wet conditions.

[WARNINGS]
! Green/live wood produces excessive smoke and poor heat.
! Driftwood and treated/painted wood release toxic chemicals when burned.
! Softwood sparks and pops — dangerous near shelters or dry conditions.
