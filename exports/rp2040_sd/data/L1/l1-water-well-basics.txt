[SUMMARY]
Basic principles of locating and digging a hand well for groundwater access.

[STEPS]
1. Look for indicators of shallow water table: green vegetation, low-lying areas, existing seeps.
2. Dig at least 50 meters from any latrine, animal area, or contamination source.
3. Dig a hole 3-4 feet in diameter; line walls with rocks or wood to prevent collapse.
4. Continue digging until water seeps in and collects.
5. Allow well to fill, then bail out muddy water — repeat until water runs clearer.
6. Always treat well water before drinking — groundwater is not guaranteed safe.

[WARNINGS]
! Cave-in is the primary danger — never dig without shoring walls.
! Well digging in sandy soil is extremely dangerous without proper lining.
! Groundwater can still contain bacteria, parasites, and chemicals — always treat.
! Locate well uphill from latrines and waste disposal areas.
