[SUMMARY]
Preventing carbon monoxide poisoning and fire hazards when using fire in shelters.

[STEPS]
1. Never burn fire in a sealed space — ensure ventilation opening at top and bottom of shelter.
2. Place fire near entrance or under vent hole, not in center of sealed room.
3. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless — symptoms: headache, dizziness, confusion, death.
4. Use small, controlled fires — large fires consume oxygen rapidly in enclosed spaces.
5. Keep combustible materials at least 3 feet from fire.
6. Extinguish fire completely before sleeping in enclosed space — use heated rocks for warmth instead.

[WARNINGS]
! Carbon monoxide poisoning kills silently in sleep — ventilation is non-negotiable.
! Charcoal and briquettes produce extreme CO — never use indoors.
! Snow shelters with fire require ventilation holes kept clear at all times.
! If anyone feels dizzy or headachy near indoor fire, evacuate immediately.
