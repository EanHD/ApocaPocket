[SUMMARY]
Evaluating and selecting safe locations for shelter placement in the field.

[STEPS]
1. Avoid valley floors and dry riverbeds — cold air pooling and flash flood risk.
2. Avoid ridgetops and exposed areas — high wind and lightning risk.
3. Ideal: slightly elevated, wooded area with natural windbreak, near (not in) water source.
4. Check overhead for dead branches and leaning trees.
5. Note drainage patterns — do not shelter where water will flow during rain.
6. Consider proximity to resources (water, firewood) but balance against hazards (animals at water).

[WARNINGS]
! Flash floods kill in canyons and low areas — even with clear skies locally, upstream rain can surge.
! Avoid animal trails and dens — wildlife encounters at night.
! Standing dead trees ('snags') fall unpredictably — shelter well clear.
! Coastal areas: account for tide changes and storm surge.
