[SUMMARY]
Proper methods for storing treated water to prevent recontamination.

[STEPS]
1. Use food-grade containers with tight-fitting lids.
2. Clean containers with dilute bleach solution before first use.
3. Store in cool, dark location — light promotes algae growth.
4. Use containers with narrow openings or spigots to prevent hand contact with water.
5. Label containers with treatment date.
6. Rotate stored water every 6 months; re-treat if stored longer.

[WARNINGS]
! Never use containers that held chemicals, fuel, or non-food substances.
! Dipping cups/hands into stored water recontaminates it.
! Plastic containers degrade in sunlight — store in shade.
