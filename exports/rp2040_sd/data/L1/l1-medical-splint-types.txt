[SUMMARY]
Immobilize fractures and dislocations to prevent further injury, reduce pain, and enable transport. The rule: splint above and below the injury, immobilizing the joints on either side of the break.

[STEPS]
1. Rigid splint materials: straight sticks (wrist-thick), trekking poles, tent poles, rolled newspaper/magazine, corrugated cardboard, bark slabs, split bamboo, rifle/shotgun barrel.
2. Padding: place cloth, moss, leaves, or clothing between splint and skin. Padding prevents pressure sores and improves immobilization.
3. Forearm fracture: place one rigid splint on top (dorsal) and one on bottom (palmar) of forearm. Extend from mid-upper-arm past fingertips. Bind at 4 points above and below fracture. Sling arm across chest.
4. Lower leg fracture: place splints on inside and outside of leg. Extend from mid-thigh to past the foot. Bind at 5-6 points. Include the foot in a natural position. A buddy's leg can serve as splint (tie injured leg to uninjured leg).
5. Improvised traction splint (femur fracture): critical for thigh fractures which can bleed 1-2 liters internally. Use two long sticks — one from armpit to past foot, one from groin to past foot. Pad groin and armpit. Apply gentle traction by pulling foot and securing with cravat to lower splint end.
6. Sling-and-swath for shoulder/collarbone: fold triangular bandage (or large cloth cut diagonally). Place forearm in sling at 90° angle. Tie at neck. Wrap a 'swath' (belt or cloth strip) around torso and arm to prevent swinging.
7. Finger splint: tape injured finger to adjacent finger (buddy splint) with small padding between. Or use a popsicle stick/twig as rigid splint with tape.
8. Ankle/foot: wrap in pillow or thick clothing and bind. Or use figure-8 wrap with elastic/cloth bandage. Leave toes exposed to monitor circulation.
9. After splinting: elevate injured limb above heart level when possible. Apply cold (wet cloth, creek water, snow in cloth) for 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off to reduce swelling.
10. Check circulation every 30 minutes: pulse below fracture, skin color, temperature, sensation, and ability to move fingers/toes.

[WARNINGS]
! Never attempt to straighten or realign a deformed limb unless circulation is absent below the fracture (no pulse, blue/white fingers or toes)
! Check circulation BEFORE and AFTER splinting — if fingers/toes become blue, numb, or cold, the splint is too tight
! Open fractures (bone visible or puncture wound at fracture site) require wound coverage BEFORE splinting — do not push bone back in
! Spinal injury: DO NOT MOVE the patient unless in immediate danger. Immobilize head and neck in position found.
! Swelling will increase for 24-48 hours — check and loosen bindings regularly
