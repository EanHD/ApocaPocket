[SUMMARY]
Char cloth is cotton fabric converted to carbon through pyrolysis (heating without oxygen). It catches the smallest sparks from flint-and-steel, ferro rods, or even bow drill embers. One batch lasts months. Essential for primitive and traditional fire starting.

[STEPS]
1. MATERIALS: 100% cotton fabric (old t-shirt, denim, bandana), a metal tin with a tight-fitting lid (Altoids tin is classic, any small metal container works). Punch ONE small hole in the lid — needle-sized — for gas to escape.
2. Cut fabric into 1-2 inch squares. Pack them loosely into the tin — don't compress. They need some air space between layers. Fill the tin but don't cram.
3. Place the sealed tin on hot coals (not in direct flame). You'll see a jet of smoke/flame coming from the pin hole — this is volatile gases escaping. The process is working.
4. When the smoke jet stops or becomes very thin (10-20 minutes depending on tin size), the charring is complete. Remove tin from heat. IMPORTANT: plug the hole with a small stick or clay immediately — if air enters while hot, the char cloth will ignite and burn to ash.
5. Let the tin cool completely before opening (30+ minutes). If cloth is still brown in spots, char again. Properly charred cloth is uniformly black, fragile, and has a silky sheen. It should NOT crumble to dust — that's over-charred.
6. TO USE: place a piece of char cloth on top of flint or next to your tinder. Strike steel against flint to produce sparks (sharp edge of flint, use the spine of a carbon steel knife — stainless steel won't spark). A spark landing on char cloth produces a growing red ember.
7. Transfer the glowing char cloth into a tinder bundle (dry grass nest, cedar bark, etc.). Fold tinder around it gently and blow with steady breaths until it bursts into flame.
8. ALTERNATIVE CHAR MATERIALS: punk wood (soft rotted wood), cattail pith, and dried fungi (amadou from horse hoof fungus) can also be charred. Punk wood char catches sparks almost as well as cloth.
9. STORAGE: keep char cloth absolutely dry in a sealed metal tin. A single Altoids tin holds enough char cloth for 30-50 fires. Make new batches whenever you have a campfire — it costs nothing.

[WARNINGS]
! The charring process produces flammable gases — keep the tin AWAY from direct flame contact to prevent the gas jet from igniting the cloth inside
! Char cloth is extremely fragile — handle gently and store in a rigid container, not a plastic bag
! Only use 100% cotton or linen fabric — synthetic fabrics melt instead of charring and produce toxic fumes
! The tin will be very hot during and after charring — use tongs or gloves
