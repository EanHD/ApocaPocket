[SUMMARY]
A natural spring is groundwater emerging at the surface — often the safest natural water source because the ground has filtered it. Developing and protecting a spring can provide reliable, clean water for a permanent settlement. A good spring produces 1-10+ gallons per minute.

[STEPS]
1. FINDING SPRINGS: look for areas where green vegetation persists during dry periods, wet spots on hillsides, water seeping from rock faces, areas where frogs/mosquitoes concentrate. Springs commonly emerge at geological transitions (where permeable rock meets impermeable clay).
2. ASSESS FLOW: place a container under the flow and time how long to fill. 1 gallon per minute = 1,440 gallons per day — more than enough for a large group. Even 1 gallon per hour (0.017 gpm) supplies drinking water for 5-10 people.
3. CLEAR THE AREA: remove debris, organic matter, and loose soil from around the spring emergence point. Dig down to find the actual source point in rock or gravel.
4. BUILD A SPRING BOX: construct a small enclosure (stone, concrete, or wood) around the emergence point. This protects the source from surface contamination, animals, and debris. Size: 2-3 feet square, 2-3 feet deep. The box must have: an overflow pipe (to handle excess flow), a collection pipe (to direct water where you want it), and a sealed or screened top (to keep out animals and debris).
5. DIVERSION: install a pipe from the spring box to a collection point downhill. PVC pipe is ideal; bamboo or hollowed logs work. The pipe should maintain continuous downhill slope. End at a collection basin or tap point.
6. PROTECTION ZONE: establish a protection area uphill of the spring — minimum 100 feet. No latrines, animal pens, composting, or chemical storage uphill of a spring. Build a diversion ditch above the spring to route surface runoff away from the source.
7. SETTLING BASIN: if water carries sediment, build a settling tank between the spring and your collection point. A simple rock-lined pool where water slows and particles settle. Clean sediment from the basin monthly.
8. MAINTENANCE: inspect spring box monthly. Clear overflow pipe of debris. Monitor flow rate — sudden decrease may indicate blockage (clean intake) or drought conditions. Sudden increase in turbidity after rain indicates surface contamination is entering — may need to improve protection.

[WARNINGS]
! Even spring water can be contaminated — test by boiling a sample and checking for taste/residue before relying on it as sole source
! Springs can contain dissolved minerals, including arsenic, fluoride, and heavy metals depending on geology. Extended use without testing carries risk.
! Springs can dry up seasonally — observe flow through wet and dry seasons before depending on it for permanent water supply
! Developing a spring near agricultural land or septic systems risks contamination from runoff
