[SUMMARY]
Proper wound irrigation and cleaning techniques to prevent infection in field conditions.

[STEPS]
1. Wash hands thoroughly or use gloves if available.
2. Control any active bleeding with direct pressure before cleaning.
3. Irrigate the wound with clean water using gentle pressure (syringe or squeeze bottle).
4. Remove visible debris and foreign material with clean tweezers.
5. Pat dry with clean cloth and apply sterile dressing.
6. Monitor for signs of infection over following days.

[WARNINGS]
! Do not use hydrogen peroxide or alcohol directly in deep wounds — causes tissue damage.
! Do not remove deeply embedded objects — stabilize in place and seek advanced care.
! Puncture wounds and animal bites carry high infection risk — monitor closely.
