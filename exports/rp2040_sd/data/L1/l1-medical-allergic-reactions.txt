[SUMMARY]
Recognizing and managing allergic reactions from mild hives to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

[STEPS]
1. Remove/stop exposure to allergen if possible.
2. Mild reactions: antihistamine (diphenhydramine 25-50mg oral).
3. Anaphylaxis signs: throat swelling, difficulty breathing, widespread hives, drop in blood pressure.
4. Use epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) in outer thigh immediately for anaphylaxis.
5. Position patient: sitting up if breathing difficulty, lying flat if low blood pressure.
6. Be prepared for second wave (biphasic reaction) — monitor for at least 4 hours.

[WARNINGS]
! Anaphylaxis kills in minutes without epinephrine — do not delay.
! Antihistamines alone do NOT treat anaphylaxis.
! Common triggers: bee stings, nuts, shellfish, medications — know group members' allergies.
