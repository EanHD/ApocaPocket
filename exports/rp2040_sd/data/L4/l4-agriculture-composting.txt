[SUMMARY]
Building and managing compost piles to convert organic waste into nutrient-rich soil amendment.

[STEPS]
1. Balance 'greens' (nitrogen-rich: food scraps, fresh grass) with 'browns' (carbon-rich: dry leaves, straw, cardboard).
2. Target ratio: roughly 3 parts brown to 1 part green by volume.
3. Chop materials into smaller pieces to speed decomposition.
4. Build pile at least 1m × 1m × 1m for adequate heat retention.
5. Keep moist like a wrung-out sponge—too wet goes anaerobic, too dry stops decomposition.
6. Turn pile every 1–2 weeks to introduce oxygen and distribute heat.
7. Hot composting (55–65°C internal) kills weed seeds and pathogens in 4–8 weeks.
8. Finished compost is dark, crumbly, earthy-smelling, with no recognizable materials.

[WARNINGS]
! Do not compost meat, dairy, or human waste in basic piles—attracts pests and pathogens.
! Anaerobic piles produce methane and hydrogen sulfide—foul smell indicates poor aeration.
