[SUMMARY]
Constructing bellows to provide forced air for forge fires and metalworking.

[STEPS]
1. Bag bellows (simplest): a leather or hide bag with a nozzle—squeeze to force air out.
2. Double-chamber bellows: two bags with valves, alternating to provide continuous airflow.
3. Box bellows: a piston in a wooden box with flap valves—East Asian design, very effective.
4. Nozzle (tuyere) should be narrow to increase air velocity into the fire.
5. Position tuyere to blow into the center of the charcoal bed.
6. Sustained airflow of ~100 L/min needed to reach forging temperatures.
7. Protect bellows materials from radiant heat—use a clay or stone shield between bellows and fire.

[WARNINGS]
! Bellows near forge fires—keep combustible parts away from heat.
! Tuyere can clog with slag—maintain and clear regularly.
