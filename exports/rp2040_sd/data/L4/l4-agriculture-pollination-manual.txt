[SUMMARY]
Hand pollination techniques for when natural pollinators are absent or insufficient.

[STEPS]
1. Identify male flowers (stamens with pollen) vs female flowers (pistil with swollen base/ovary).
2. Cucurbits (squash, melon): pick male flower, remove petals, dab pollen onto female flower stigma.
3. Tomatoes/peppers: shake or vibrate flowers gently (they are self-pollinating but benefit from movement).
4. Corn: collect pollen from tassels (top), sprinkle onto silks (ears).
5. Fruit trees: use a small paintbrush or cotton swab to transfer pollen between flowers.
6. Pollinate in morning when flowers are freshly open and pollen is dry.
7. For seed purity: bag flowers before they open, hand pollinate, re-bag to prevent cross-pollination.
