[SUMMARY]
Circuit reasoning framework for basic repairs and safe troubleshooting.

[STEPS]
1. Identify voltage source, load, and continuity path.
2. Apply Ohm's law to estimate current and resistance.
3. Isolate fault by section testing.
4. Verify polarity and connection quality before energizing.

[WARNINGS]
! Electrical shock and fire risks are severe.
! Disconnect power before repairs whenever possible.
