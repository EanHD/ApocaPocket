[SUMMARY]
Building a basic forge for heating metal using charcoal fuel and forced air.

[STEPS]
1. Build a fire pot: a contained depression (clay, stone, or salvaged steel) to hold burning charcoal.
2. Install a tuyere (air pipe) entering the fire pot from below or the side.
3. Connect tuyere to bellows or blower for forced air supply.
4. Use hardwood charcoal as fuel—it burns cleaner and hotter than wood.
5. An anvil can be any large, hard, flat-topped heavy metal or stone surface.
6. Basic tools needed: tongs (or pliers), hammer, and a quenching bucket of water.
7. Heat metal to orange-yellow before working; red heat is too cool for most forging.

[WARNINGS]
! Forge temperatures exceed 1000°C—severe burn risk.
! Hot metal looks the same as cold metal in bright light—use tongs always.
! Ensure adequate ventilation—carbon monoxide from charcoal is lethal.
! Flying sparks and scale—wear eye protection and natural fiber clothing (synthetics melt).
