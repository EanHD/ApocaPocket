[SUMMARY]
Designing simple, efficient LED lighting circuits for battery-powered or solar systems.

[STEPS]
1. LEDs are extremely efficient: a single 1W LED provides usable reading light.
2. LEDs need a current-limiting resistor: R = (V_supply − V_LED) / I_LED.
3. Typical white LED: forward voltage ~3V, operating current ~20mA.
4. For 12V system with white LED: R = (12 − 3) / 0.020 = 450Ω (use 470Ω standard value).
5. Wire multiple LEDs in series to reduce wasted energy in resistors.
6. Salvage LEDs from broken flashlights, electronics, car lights, and holiday string lights.
7. Use a simple switch for on/off; dimming possible with variable resistor (potentiometer).

[WARNINGS]
! LEDs are polarity-sensitive—connect correctly (long leg = positive/anode).
! Without a current limiter, LEDs burn out instantly.
! Bright LEDs can cause eye strain—diffuse light with translucent cover.
