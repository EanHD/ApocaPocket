[SUMMARY]
Designing and building simple waterwheels to convert flowing water into mechanical power.

[STEPS]
1. Assess water source: measure flow rate and available head (height drop).
2. Overshot wheel (most efficient): water pours into buckets at top, weight turns wheel. Needs 2m+ head.
3. Undershot wheel (simplest): paddles dip into flowing stream. Works with low head but lower efficiency.
4. Build wheel from wood: hub, spokes, rim, and paddles/buckets.
5. Mount on a strong axle supported by bearings (hardwood or greased stone).
6. Transfer power via the axle to grinding stones, bellows, hammers, or generators.
7. Build a millrace (channel) to direct water to the wheel and control flow with a gate.

[WARNINGS]
! Moving machinery causes crush and entanglement injuries—guard exposed gears and belts.
! Water structures can fail in floods—build with flood contingency.
