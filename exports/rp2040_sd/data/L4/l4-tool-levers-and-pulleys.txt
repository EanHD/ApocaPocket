[SUMMARY]
Mechanical advantage basics for lifting, extraction, and transport tasks.

[STEPS]
1. Determine load, fulcrum, and effort placement.
2. Calculate ideal mechanical advantage.
3. Minimize friction and rope angle losses.
4. Use controlled lifting and backup restraints.

[WARNINGS]
! Dynamic loading can exceed static assumptions.
! Rope or anchor failure can be lethal.
