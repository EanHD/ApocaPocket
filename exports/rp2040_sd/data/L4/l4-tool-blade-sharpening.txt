[SUMMARY]
Principles of edge geometry, sharpening angles, and honing techniques for knives and tools.

[STEPS]
1. Understand edge angles: 15° per side for fine cutting, 20–25° for general use, 30°+ for chopping/splitting.
2. Find natural whetstones: fine-grained sandstone, slate, or river-smoothed stones.
3. Coarse sharpening: establish the bevel angle by grinding on coarse stone with water.
4. Fine honing: switch to smooth stone, maintain consistent angle, alternating sides.
5. Strop on smooth leather or cardboard to remove wire edge and polish.
6. Test sharpness: blade should catch on thumbnail or shave arm hair.
7. Maintain edges regularly—frequent light honing prevents need for major resharpening.

[WARNINGS]
! Always cut away from your body when sharpening.
! Secure the stone—it should not slip during use.
