[SUMMARY]
Building a simple crystal radio receiver for AM broadcast reception without external power.

[STEPS]
1. Crystal radios require NO batteries or external power—they run on received radio wave energy.
2. Wind a coil: ~100 turns of insulated wire around a cardboard tube (~5cm diameter).
3. Make a tuning slider or tap points along the coil to select different stations.
4. Detector: a germanium diode (or galena crystal with cat-whisker wire contact).
5. Connect a high-impedance earpiece (piezoelectric works best).
6. Antenna: run a long wire (10–30m) as high as possible outdoors.
7. Ground: connect to a metal rod in earth or a cold water pipe.
8. Circuit: antenna → coil → diode → earpiece → ground.

[WARNINGS]
! Long wire antennas attract lightning—disconnect during storms.
! Crystal radios only receive strong nearby AM stations—range is limited.
