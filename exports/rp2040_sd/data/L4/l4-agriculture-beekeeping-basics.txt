[SUMMARY]
Bees provide honey (long-term calorie storage), beeswax (candles, waterproofing, lubricant), and pollination (increases crop yields 30-70%). A top-bar hive requires no special equipment — just a wooden box with angled bars. Bees can be captured from wild colonies.

[STEPS]
1. TOP-BAR HIVE CONSTRUCTION: box approximately 40 inches long, 12 inches deep, sides angled inward at ~120° (trapezoidal cross-section). This angle matches natural comb. Use any available wood — 3/4 inch thick minimum. Entrance: 3/8 inch holes (pencil-diameter) at one end, or a slot along the bottom.
2. TOP BARS: flat bars (sticks) 1.25 inches wide (32mm) — this matches natural bee spacing. Lay bars across the top of the box touching edge-to-edge. Bees build comb hanging from each bar. Apply a thin line of beeswax down the center of each bar as a guide (melt wax and drip a line).
3. CATCHING A SWARM: spring (April-June in temperate zones) is swarming season. A swarm is a cluster of bees on a branch — they're docile (gorged with honey, have no hive to defend). Shake or brush swarm into a box. Place near the hive. At dusk, transfer into hive. Or: set a bait hive (empty hive with lemongrass oil or old comb inside) in a tree — scouts will find it.
4. BEE TREE TRANSFER: find a wild colony in a hollow tree. Cut section containing the colony (evening is safest — all bees are home). Secure comb into hive frames/bars with string or rubber bands. Transfer bees by shaking them in. Feed sugar water (1:1 ratio) for 2 weeks while they adjust.
5. SMOKER: roll dried grass, burlap, or punk wood into a tin can with holes. Light and let it smolder. Puff smoke gently at hive entrance and under bars before inspecting. Smoke triggers bees to gorge on honey (preparing to flee) which makes them docile. 2-3 gentle puffs is enough — don't overdo it.
6. INSPECTIONS: check hive every 2-3 weeks during active season. Look for: queen cells (peanut-shaped, means they're preparing to swarm — split the hive), brood pattern (should be solid, not spotty), food stores (honey in top bars), pests (small hive beetles, wax moths, varroa mites).
7. HONEY HARVEST: lift bars with capped (wax-sealed) honey comb. Cut comb from bar, crush into a container, and strain through cloth. Honey flows out, wax stays in cloth. Return empty bar to hive — bees will rebuild comb. Harvest surplus only — never take from the brood area.
8. BEESWAX PROCESSING: melt wax cappings and crushed comb in a double boiler (pot inside a pot of water). Strain through cloth into a mold. Beeswax is used for: candles, waterproofing cloth/leather, lubricant, sewing thread coating, wood finish, and fire starting (wax-soaked fabric = excellent tinder).
9. WINTER MANAGEMENT (temperate): reduce entrance to 1 inch width (block with grass/wood). Insulate hive top with straw or burlap. Do NOT wrap sides — bees need ventilation to prevent condensation (wet bees die). Leave 40+ lbs honey (8-10 full bars). If light on stores, feed thick sugar syrup (2:1 sugar:water).
10. COLONY MULTIPLICATION: when hive is strong (15+ bars of comb, lots of bees), split it. Move half the bars (including bars with eggs/young larvae) into a new hive. The half without a queen will raise a new queen from young larvae within 16 days. Feed both halves sugar water for 2 weeks after splitting.

[WARNINGS]
! Bee stings can cause anaphylaxis in allergic individuals — have a plan before opening a hive. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) on hand as minimum.
! African/Africanized bees (tropical regions) are significantly more aggressive — approach hives in full protective gear only
! Never harvest all honey — leave minimum 30-40 lbs for the colony to survive winter (temperate climates). Taking too much kills the colony.
! Smoke calms bees but excessive smoke drives them to abandon the hive permanently
