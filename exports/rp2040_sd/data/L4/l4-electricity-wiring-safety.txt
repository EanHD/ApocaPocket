[SUMMARY]
Safe practices for basic electrical wiring, connections, and grounding in improvised systems.

[STEPS]
1. Always disconnect power before working on wiring.
2. Use appropriate wire gauge for current load—thinner wire overheats with too much current.
3. Rule of thumb: 14 AWG for ≤15A, 12 AWG for ≤20A in copper wire.
4. Make secure connections: twist wires together, solder if possible, insulate with tape or heat shrink.
5. Ground metal enclosures: connect to a metal rod driven into moist earth.
6. Install fuses or breakers—a simple fuse is a thin wire that melts before the main wire overheats.
7. Keep wiring away from water, heat sources, and areas where it can be damaged.

[WARNINGS]
! Electrical shock can be fatal—never work on live circuits.
! Poor connections cause arcing and fire—ensure all joints are tight and insulated.
! Battery banks can deliver hundreds of amps in a short circuit—treat with same respect as mains power.
