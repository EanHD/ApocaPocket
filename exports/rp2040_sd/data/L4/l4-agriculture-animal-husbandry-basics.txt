[SUMMARY]
Basics of keeping chickens, rabbits, and goats for food production in a survival context.

[STEPS]
1. Chickens: easiest starter livestock. Need shelter from predators, water, feed (grain/scraps/forage), and nest boxes.
2. Expect 4–6 eggs/week per hen. Roosters needed only for breeding, not egg production.
3. Rabbits: quiet, compact, fast-breeding. Feed on grass, hay, garden scraps. Meat in 8–12 weeks.
4. Goats: provide milk, meat, and brush clearing. Need fencing (goats escape everything), shelter, and browse/hay.
5. All livestock need: clean water daily, shelter from weather, protection from predators, and basic health observation.
6. Start small—learn with a few animals before scaling up.
7. Manure from all three is excellent garden fertilizer (compost chicken/rabbit manure first—it's hot).

[WARNINGS]
! Livestock attract predators—secure housing is essential.
! Animal diseases can spread to humans (zoonosis)—practice hygiene, wash hands after handling.
! Rabbit starvation: rabbit meat alone is too lean—supplement diet with fats.
