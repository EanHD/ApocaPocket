[SUMMARY]
Hand-building pottery using coil and slab methods without a potter's wheel.

[STEPS]
1. Gather and process clay: dig, remove stones and roots, add water to make workable consistency.
2. Temper clay by mixing in fine sand or crushed shell (~20%) to prevent cracking during firing.
3. Coil method: roll clay ropes, stack in circles, smooth joints inside and out.
4. Slab method: roll clay flat, cut pieces, join with slip (clay+water paste) and scoring.
5. Pinch method: start with a ball, pinch and rotate to form a bowl shape.
6. Dry slowly in shade for several days—rapid drying causes cracking.
7. Fire in pit kiln or open fire—heat slowly, then bring to full temperature for 1–2 hours.

[WARNINGS]
! Pots explode if moisture remains when fired—ensure thorough drying.
! Air bubbles in clay can cause explosive failure during firing—wedge (knead) clay thoroughly.
