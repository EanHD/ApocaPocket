[SUMMARY]
Soil structure, organic matter, and nutrient cycling fundamentals for reliable food production.

[STEPS]
1. Assess texture, drainage, and compaction.
2. Build organic matter via compost and cover crops.
3. Use rotation to reduce pest/nutrient pressure.
4. Track pH and amend gradually.

[WARNINGS]
! Over-fertilization harms soil biology and water quality.
! Poor sanitation in composting can spread pathogens.
