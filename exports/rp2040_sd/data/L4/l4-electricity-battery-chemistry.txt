[SUMMARY]
Comparison of common battery chemistries and maintenance constraints.

[STEPS]
1. Choose chemistry by energy density, cycle life, and temperature tolerance.
2. Use safe charging profiles for chemistry type.
3. Monitor voltage and temperature trends.
4. Store cells at recommended state-of-charge.

[WARNINGS]
! Improper charging can cause fire/explosion.
! Damaged lithium cells require strict handling.
