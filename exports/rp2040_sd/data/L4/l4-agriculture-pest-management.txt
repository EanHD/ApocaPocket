[SUMMARY]
Non-chemical and low-tech approaches to managing garden and crop pests.

[STEPS]
1. Prevention first: healthy soil, proper spacing, crop rotation, and resistant varieties.
2. Physical barriers: row covers, netting, fences, and copper tape for slugs.
3. Hand-picking: inspect plants daily, remove and destroy pest insects and eggs.
4. Companion planting: marigolds deter nematodes, basil repels some flies, nasturtiums trap aphids.
5. Biological control: encourage predators—ladybugs eat aphids, birds eat caterpillars, toads eat slugs.
6. Soap spray: dilute soap in water (1 tbsp per liter) for soft-bodied insects (aphids, mites).
7. Accept some damage—healthy plants tolerate minor pest pressure without intervention.

[WARNINGS]
! Even natural pesticides (neem, pyrethrin) can harm beneficial insects—use as last resort.
! Identify pests correctly before treatment—many insects are beneficial.
