[SUMMARY]
Designing gravity-fed irrigation systems using elevation differences to deliver water to crops.

[STEPS]
1. Water source must be higher than the garden—even 1–2m of elevation creates usable pressure.
2. Calculate: 1m of height = ~0.1 bar (1.4 psi) of water pressure.
3. Furrow irrigation: dig shallow channels between crop rows, flood periodically from a main canal.
4. Drip irrigation: run a hose/pipe from an elevated tank, punch small holes near each plant.
5. Regulate flow: use a valve or pinch clamp at the tank to control delivery rate.
6. Mulch around plants to reduce evaporation—irrigation is only as good as moisture retention.
7. Water in early morning or evening to minimize evaporation losses.

[WARNINGS]
! Standing water breeds mosquitoes—use drip methods when possible.
! Over-irrigation causes root rot and nutrient leaching.
