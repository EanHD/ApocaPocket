## Generation Strategy
1. **Wave 1**: Medical emergencies, poisonous plants, extreme environments (+30 L1)
2. **Wave 2**: Regional plant expansions, more mushrooms, fish/game (+50 L2)
3. **Wave 3**: Wood/clay/fiber details, minerals (+40 L3)
4. **Wave 4**: Specific tool projects, agriculture crops, structures (+60 L4)
5. **Wave 5**: Health conditions, education, governance (+45 L5)
6. **Final pass**: Fill remaining gaps to exactly 500

This gets us a truly comprehensive survival database that feels premium and complete on the RP2040.
