## Critical Safety Achievements

### Poisonous Plant Warnings - HIGHEST PRIORITY

1. **Poison Hemlock vs Wild Carrot**
   - Key ID: Purple stem blotches, smooth stem, musty odor
   - Wild carrot: Hairy stem, carrot smell, purple center flower
   - RULE: If smooth stem or purple blotches → DO NOT EAT

2. **Death Camas vs Edible Camas**
   - Key ID: White/cream flowers = DEADLY, Blue flowers = SAFE
   - RULE: NEVER harvest camas bulbs unless you saw BLUE flowers on that specific plant
   - Bulbs are identical when not flowering

3. **Poison Iris vs Cattail**
   - Key ID: Iris has MIDRIB down leaf center and FANS from base
   - Cattail has parallel veins, no midrib, leaves wrap around each other
   - RULE: If you see midrib or fan arrangement → TOXIC → DO NOT EAT

4. **Deadly Mushrooms**
   - Death Cap: VOLVA (cup at base), white gills
   - False Morel: NOT hollow (has chambers)
   - RULE: If not hollow, not a true morel. If volva present, assume deadly Amanita.
