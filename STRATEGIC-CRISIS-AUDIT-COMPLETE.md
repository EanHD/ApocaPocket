## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

These enhancements multiply the value of the knowledge base by providing:

- After: Entries tell you WHEN to do them (Hour 3 vs Day 3) and WHY (priority logic, survival rationale)

### **Decision Support Under Stress**
- Clear flowcharts guide action when cognitive function is impaired
- Checklists prevent forgetting critical steps
- Timelines provide structure in chaos

### **Integration Across Entries**
- Mental health protocols now thread through all crisis scenarios
- Resource assessment informs tactical projects
- First 24 hours framework referenced by all crisis entries
- Group dynamics guidance applicable to all community situations

### **Realistic Preparedness**
- Common mistakes sections based on real failures
- Timeline planning reveals resource gaps before crisis
- Mental health acknowledgment (psychological survival = physical survival)

## CONCLUSION

✅ **Task Complete**

All 20 strategic framework and crisis scenario entries have been enhanced and verified. The 6 most critical entries received comprehensive overhauls with full timeline planning, decision frameworks, mental health protocols, resource matrices, and common fatal mistakes sections. All entries now have `audit_status: verified` and updated `last_verified` dates.

The knowledge base now provides not just "how-to" information, but "when-why-who" strategic guidance that makes the tactical entries actionable under real crisis conditions.

**These entries multiply the value of all tactical entries** — they're the "when" and "why," not just "how."
