## 🎯 Why Phase 2 Matters

**ApocaPocket is now practical for modern preppers:**

**Before Phase 2:**
- Excellent for wilderness survival ✓
- Strong medical protocols ✓
- Good urban survival ✓
- **BUT:** Limited help maintaining modern technology ❌

**After Phase 2:**
- Keep solar panels running when the grid fails ✓
