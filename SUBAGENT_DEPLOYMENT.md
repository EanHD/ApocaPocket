# Sub-Agent Deployment Status
**Launched:** 2026-02-19 04:15 PST
**Strategy:** Parallel processing with 5 specialized agents

## Active Agents

| Agent ID | Category | Entries | Status |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| L1-Medical-Audit | L1 Medical | 28 | 🟡 WORKING |
| L1-Survival-Skills-Audit | L1 Fire/Water/Shelter/Nav | 63 | 🟡 WORKING |
| L2-Plants-Animals-Audit | L2 Food & Biology | 67 | 🟡 WORKING |
| L3-L4-L5-Audit | L3/L4/L5 All | 153 | 🟡 WORKING |
| Strategic-Crisis-Audit | Strategic & Crisis | 20+ | 🟡 WORKING |

**Total Coverage:** 331+ entries (95%+ of database)

## What They're Doing RIGHT NOW

Each agent is:
1. Reading entries systematically
2. Enhancing with detailed protocols + measurements
3. Generating professional diagrams (nano-banana-pro)
4. Saving diagrams to assets/diagrams/[category]/
5. Updating entries with audit_status: verified

## Expected Deliverables

### From Each Agent:
- ✅ Fully enhanced entries (specific measurements, safety warnings, tables)
- ✅ Professional diagrams (clean cyan/white/red on black, 240×240px)
- ✅ Consistent quality across all entries
- ✅ Verification status updated

### Timeline:
- **Medical (highest priority):** 2-4 hours
- **Survival skills:** 3-5 hours
- **Plants/animals (lots of diagrams):** 4-6 hours
- **L3/L4/L5:** 5-8 hours
- **Strategic:** 1-2 hours

**All working in parallel** - completion within 6-8 hours total (not 40+ hours sequential)

## Quality Control

Each agent is following the established standard:
- Specific measurements (2-2.4 inches, 100-120/min, etc.)
- Step-by-step protocols with timing
- Safety warnings from authoritative sources
- Tables for quick reference
- Special populations covered
- Common mistakes sections
- When to evacuate guidance

## Auto-Announce

Agents will automatically report back when complete. No need to poll/check - they'll send completion messages directly.

## Final Assembly

Once all agents complete:
1. Review all enhanced entries
2. Verify diagram consistency
3. Rebuild search index with new content
4. Update entry counts
5. Final quality check on sample entries
6. Push clean version to GitHub

**THIS IS HAPPENING! 🚀**

By the time you wake up, the database will be comprehensively audited, enhanced, and illustrated. The sub-agents are working through the night!
