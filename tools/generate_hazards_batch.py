Death camas, water hemlock, poison hemlock, deadly nightshade, and foxglove are the most dangerous. All edible plants have poisonous look-alikes. This entry covers recognition, symptoms, and emergency response.","warnings":["Edibility testing (see separate entry) does NOT work for highly toxic plants — one bite can be fatal","Children are more susceptible to plant poisoning due to lower body weight","Skin contact with some plants (poison hemlock, giant hogweed) causes burns and blisters","No true 'antidote' exists for most plant toxins — treatment is supportive"],"steps":["WATER HEMLOCK (Cicuta): The most violently toxic plant in North America. Looks like: white umbrella-shaped flower clusters, parsnip-like root with chambers that ooze yellow oil when cut. Found near water. LETHAL DOSE: one bite of root. SYMPTOMS: within 15 minutes — vomiting, seizures, respiratory failure, death. NO TREATMENT in the field. Only hospital care (ventilator) saves victims. AVOIDANCE: never eat white-flowered umbrella plants (carrot family) unless you are 100% certain of ID.","POISON HEMLOCK (Conium): Killed Socrates. Looks like: tall (6-10 ft), white umbrella flowers, purple blotches on hollow stems, parsley-like leaves. Smells musty. LETHAL DOSE: a few leaves. SYMPTOMS: progressive paralysis starting with legs, then respiratory muscles. Death by suffocation while conscious. TREATMENT: none in field. Medical: ventilator support until toxin clears. AVOIDANCE: Learn carrot family plants — many are edible (wild carrot, parsley) but look-alikes kill.","DEATH CAMAS (Zigadenus): Looks like: grassy leaves, white/cream flowers in spike, onion-like bulb BUT no onion smell. Found in meadows. Often mistaken for wild onion. LETHAL DOSE: one bulb. SYMPTOMS: vomiting, low blood pressure, cardiac arrest. TREATMENT: none in field. AVOIDANCE: If it looks like onion but doesn't smell like onion, DO NOT EAT.","DEADLY NIGHTSHADE (Atropa belladonna): Looks like: purple/green bell-shaped flowers, shiny black berries, bushy plant. Found in waste areas, forests. LETHAL DOSE: 10-20 berries (2-4 for children). SYMPTOMS: dilated pupils, dry mouth, hallucinations, confusion, seizures, coma. TREATMENT: induce vomiting if recent (<30 min), activated charcoal if available. Keep airway open. Cool body (toxin causes fever). AVOIDANCE: Teach children NEVER eat wild berries without adult approval.","FOXGLOVE (Digitalis): Source of heart medication digitalis, but toxic. Looks like: tall spike of tubular pink/purple flowers, fuzzy leaves. LETHAL DOSE: a few leaves. SYMPTOMS: nausea, visual disturbances (yellow halos), irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest. TREATMENT: none in field. AVOIDANCE: Beautiful but deadly. Don't confuse with comfrey (similar leaves but no flower spike).","WHITE SNAKEROOT: Killed Abraham Lincoln's mother (via milk from cows that ate it). Looks like: white fuzzy flower clusters, opposite leaves, 2-4 ft tall. SYMPTOMS: 'milk sickness' — trembling, vomiting, death. Toxin passes through milk and meat. AVOIDANCE: Know what your livestock eat if you have animals.","GENERAL SYMPTOMS OF PLANT POISONING: Digestive (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), neurological (confusion, seizures, paralysis), cardiac (irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure), respiratory (difficulty breathing). TIME MATTERS — most plant toxins act quickly.","FIELD TREATMENT (no hospital): (1) If ingestion was <30 min ago AND patient is conscious, induce vomiting (finger down throat). DO NOT induce vomiting if: patient unconscious, convulsing, or ingested petroleum/acid. (2) Activated charcoal if available (20-50g in water). (3) Treat symptoms: seizure = protect from injury, respiratory distress = open airway. (4) Keep patient hydrated if they can swallow. (5) Monitor closely. (6) Evacuate to medical care if possible.","PREVENTION: (1) NEVER eat a plant unless you are 100% certain of identification. (2) Learn common toxic plants in your region. (3) Teach children: no eating wild plants without adult permission. (4) Use multiple field guides to confirm ID — one book is not enough. (5) If in doubt, DON'T."]} ,

North America: rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths, coral snakes. Key principles: keep calm, immobilize, get to medical care. DO NOT cut, suck, tourniquet, or apply ice.","warnings":["Most snake bite deaths result from INCORRECT treatment (tourniquets, cutting, delay) not the venom itself","30% of venomous snake bites are 'dry' (no venom injected) — don't panic immediately","Coral snake venom is neurotoxic and delays symptom onset — treat as serious even if patient feels fine initially","Children and small adults are at higher risk — same venom dose in smaller body"],"steps":["IMMEDIATE (first 60 seconds): MOVE AWAY from the snake (it may strike again). Sit or lie down. STAY CALM — panic increases heart rate which spreads venom faster. Remove jewelry, tight clothing near bite (swelling will occur).","ASSESS THE BITE: Two puncture wounds = venomous (fangs). Single row of teeth marks = non-venomous. BUT: treat all snake bites as potentially venomous until proven otherwise. IDENTIFY SNAKE if safe (take photo, remember color/pattern) — helps medical treatment. DO NOT try to catch or kill the snake.","IMMOBILIZE THE LIMB: If bite is on arm/leg, immobilize it with a splint (see splinting entry). Keep limb at or slightly below heart level. DO NOT elevate above heart (increases systemic spread). DO NOT keep below heart excessively (increases local tissue damage).","WHAT TO DO: (1) Keep victim still and calm. (2) Immobilize bitten limb. (3) Mark the edge of swelling with a pen every 15 minutes (shows spread). (4) Remove rings, watches before swelling becomes severe. (5) Evacuate to medical care ASAP — antivenom is the only definitive treatment. (6) Monitor for shock (see shock entry).","WHAT NOT TO DO: (1) NO cutting the bite and sucking — increases infection, doesn't remove venom. (2) NO tourniquet — causes tissue death and can result in amputation. (3) NO ice or cold packs — worsens tissue damage. (4) NO alcohol or stimulants. (5) NO electric shock (folklore 'cure' — doesn't work). (6) DO NOT try to catch the snake.","PRESSURE IMMOBILIZATION (Australian method — for coral snakes and neurotoxic snakes ONLY, NOT for pit vipers like rattlesnakes): Wrap entire limb firmly (like an elastic bandage for a sprain) from bite site toward heart. Then splint. This slows lymphatic spread of neurotoxins. CHECK: fingertip pulse should still be present. If used on pit viper venom, it concentrates venom locally and worsens tissue damage.","SYMPTOMS TO WATCH: LOCAL: pain, swelling, bruising, blistering at bite site. SYSTEMIC (venom spreading): nausea, vomiting, weakness, difficulty breathing, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing (neurotoxic), tingling around mouth, bleeding from gums/nose. TIME: pit viper symptoms develop in 15-60 minutes. Coral snake symptoms can delay 12+ hours.","IF NO MEDICAL CARE AVAILABLE: (1) Immobilize and rest for 24-48 hours. (2) Treat pain (ibuprofen, not aspirin — aspirin worsens bleeding). (3) Keep hydrated. (4) Watch for infection (bite wound becomes infected in 24-48 hours if not treated). (5) Most patients survive even without antivenom if they rest and avoid exertion. (6) If breathing difficulty develops, this is life-threatening — consider rescue breathing.","PREVENTION: (1) Wear boots and long pants in snake country. (2) Watch where you step and reach. (3) Use a stick to move logs/rocks before reaching. (4) Snakes are most active at dawn/dusk. (5) Sleep off the ground if possible. (6) Snakes avoid humans — most bites occur when people step on or attempt to handle snakes."]} ,

A few cause serious symptoms. Black widow and brown recluse (North America), funnel-web (Australia), scorpions (global). Treatment focuses on pain management and symptom monitoring. Most bites resolve without intervention.","warnings":["Black widow venom causes severe muscle cramping that can mimic appendicitis or heart attack","Brown recluse bites cause tissue necrosis (skin death) that develops over days — looks minor initially","Scorpion stings in children can be life-threatening (respiratory failure) even when adults have mild symptoms","Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to spider/scorpion venom are possible but rare"],"steps":["BLACK WIDOW (Latrodectus): Identified by: shiny black body with red hourglass marking on underside. BITE: sharp pinprick, or may not be felt. SYMPTOMS (15-60 min): severe muscle cramps (abdomen, back, chest), rigid abdominal muscles, sweating, nausea, headache. TREATMENT: Pain control (opioids if available, NOT ibuprofen — makes symptoms worse). Muscle relaxants if available. Ice pack to bite. Most symptoms resolve in 24-48 hours. Antivenom exists but rarely needed. DANGER: elderly, children, those with heart conditions are high-risk.","BROWN RECLUSE (Loxosceles): Identified by: brown body with dark violin shape on back. BITE: initially painless or mild sting. SYMPTOMS: Over 2-8 hours — red, swollen, bullseye pattern. Over 1-3 days — center becomes black/purple (tissue necrosis). Crater develops (can be 1-6 inches). Systemic symptoms rare but include fever, chills, nausea. TREATMENT: Clean wound. Ice pack. Pain control. Elevate if on limb. AVOID CUTTING OR DEBRIDING (let dead tissue slough naturally — cutting worsens damage). Heal by secondary intention over weeks to months. PREVENTION: shake out clothing/shoes in recluse territory.","TARANTULA (large hairy spiders): BITE: painful but medically insignificant. URTICATING HAIRS (New World tarantulas): defensive hairs flicked from abdomen — cause itching, rash, respiratory irritation if inhaled. TREATMENT: wash area, apply hydrocortisone cream if available. Tape and peel (removes embedded hairs).","SCORPION STINGS: Most scorpions cause only local pain (like a wasp sting). DANGEROUS SPECIES (bark scorpion - SW USA, African/Middle Eastern species): SYMPTOMS: severe pain, numbness, muscle twitching, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, agitation. CHILDREN: risk of respiratory failure. TREATMENT: Ice pack. Pain control. Immobilize limb. Monitor breathing closely. Antivenom exists for bark scorpions (hospitals). FIELD TREATMENT: supportive — keep calm, monitor airway, be prepared for rescue breathing.","CENTIPEDE BITES: Painful but not dangerous (except giant tropical species). Local swelling, redness. TREATMENT: clean wound, ice, pain meds.","GENERAL TREATMENT FOR ARTHROPOD ENVENOMATION: (1) Clean bite/sting with soap and water. (2) Ice pack 10-15 minutes on, 10-15 minutes off. (3) Elevate if on limb. (4) Pain control (acetaminophen or ibuprofen for most; avoid ibuprofen for black widow). (5) Monitor for systemic symptoms (spreading rash, difficulty breathing, severe cramping). (6) Mark the edge of redness/swelling — if it spreads rapidly, this indicates infection (antibiotics needed) or severe envenomation.","ANAPHYLAXIS (rare but serious): If patient develops: difficulty breathing, swelling of face/tongue/throat, widespread rash, dizziness — treat as anaphylaxis (see entry). Epinephrine if available. Position on back with legs elevated. Airway support critical.","INFECTION: Bite wounds commonly get infected (bacteria from spider's mouth). Watch for: increasing pain after 24-48 hours, pus, red streaks, fever. Clean daily, apply honey or antiseptic if available. If red streaks appear (lymphangitis), antibiotics essential (see medication entry).","WHEN TO WORRY: (1) Difficulty breathing. (2) Chest or abdominal pain. (3) Severe, spreading muscle cramps. (4) Altered mental status. (5) Rapidly expanding necrotic wound. (6) Children or elderly with systemic symptoms. All require medical evacuation if possible."]} ,

Symptoms: headache, nausea, fatigue. HACE (brain swelling) and HAPE (lung fluid) are life-threatening. The only cure is DESCENT. Prevent by ascending slowly (no more than 1,000 ft/day above 8,000 ft).","warnings":["Altitude sickness kills healthy, fit people — fitness does NOT protect","HACE and HAPE can develop in hours — someone fine at noon can be dying by midnight","The ONLY treatment for severe altitude sickness is DESCENT — no amount of rest at altitude will cure it","Children may not report symptoms clearly — watch for behavioral changes (irritability, refusal to play)"],"steps":["ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS (AMS — mild): SYMPTOMS: headache (throbbing, worse at night), nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, dizziness, difficulty sleeping. Starts 6-12 hours after ascending. TREATMENT: (1) STOP ascending (do not go higher until symptoms resolve). (2) Rest for 24-48 hours at current altitude. (3) Hydrate aggressively (drink until urine is clear). (4) Ibuprofen for headache. (5) Acetazolamide (Diamox) 125-250mg twice daily speeds acclimatization. (6) If symptoms worsen or don't improve in 24 hours, DESCEND. PREVENTION: Ascend slowly (camp no more than 1,000 ft higher each night above 8,000 ft).","HIGH ALTITUDE CEREBRAL EDEMA (HACE — severe, LIFE-THREATENING): SYMPTOMS: Severe headache, vomiting, confusion, ataxia (stumbling, loss of coordination — test with heel-to-toe walk), altered mental status, seizures, coma. TREATMENT: (1) DESCEND IMMEDIATELY — even 1,000 ft descent can be life-saving. (2) Dexamethasone 8mg, then 4mg every 6 hours (steroid reduces brain swelling). (3) Oxygen if available. (4) Evacuate to medical care. TIMELINE: Hours matter. HACE can progress to death in 12-24 hours without descent.","HIGH ALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA (HAPE — severe, LIFE-THREATENING): SYMPTOMS: Shortness of breath at rest (not just on exertion), dry cough progressing to wet cough with pink/frothy sputum, chest tightness, rapid heart rate, bluish lips/fingernails, fatigue out of proportion to exertion. TREATMENT: (1) DESCEND IMMEDIATELY. (2) Keep warm (cold worsens HAPE). (3) Minimize exertion (rest during descent — be carried if possible). (4) Nifedipine 30mg extended-release every 12 hours (reduces pulmonary artery pressure). (5) Oxygen if available. (6) Evacuate. TIMELINE: HAPE progresses rapidly — can be fatal in 24 hours.","ATAXIA TEST (critical for distinguishing AMS from HACE): Have the person walk a straight line heel-to-toe (like a sobriety test). If they stumble, lose balance, or cannot complete the line, this indicates HACE. DESCEND immediately.","PREVENTION: (1) Ascend slowly. Ideal: 1,000 ft elevation gain per night above 8,000 ft. 'Climb high, sleep low' — you can day-hike higher, but descend to sleep. (2) Hydrate aggressively (dehydration worsens symptoms). (3) Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (depress breathing). (4) Consider acetazolamide (Diamox) 125mg twice daily starting 24 hours before ascent — aids acclimatization. (5) Listen to your body — ego kills at altitude.","FIELD DIFFERENTIATION: AMS = headache + nausea, person can still walk/function normally. HACE = confusion + ataxia, person cannot walk straight line. HAPE = shortness of breath at rest, wet cough. If unsure, treat as HACE/HAPE and descend.","DESCENT PROTOCOL: Even 1,000-1,500 ft (300-500m) descent often reverses symptoms dramatically. If patient cannot walk, carry them down. Speed matters more than method. Once lower, continue to monitor — symptoms can recur if you re-ascend too soon.","LONG-TERM ACCLIMATIZATION: Takes 4-7 days to fully acclimatize to a new altitude. Some people never acclimatize to extreme altitude (>18,000 ft) — individual variation. Acclimatization is lost within 1-2 weeks after descending."]} ,

You cannot outrun lightning (moves at 1/3 the speed of light). The only safety is proper positioning and shelter. If you can hear thunder, you're in danger. '30-30 rule': if time between flash and thunder is <30 seconds, seek shelter. Wait 30 minutes after last thunder before resuming activity.","warnings":["Lightning can strike up to 10 miles from the storm — 'bolt from the blue' kills in sunny weather when storm is on the horizon","Sheltering under a single tree is one of the most dangerous things you can do in a thunderstorm","Metal does NOT attract lightning, but it conducts electricity well — don't hold metal objects, but metal structures (cars, buildings) are safe if you're inside","Ground current (lightning spreading through ground) causes most injuries, not direct strikes"],"steps":["RECOGNIZE DANGER: If you can hear thunder OR see lightning, you are in strike range. Flash-to-bang count: see lightning, count seconds until thunder. Divide by 5 = distance in miles. If <6 seconds (1 mile), danger is imminent. Hair standing on end, tingling skin, buzzing metal objects = IMMEDIATE pre-strike warning. Drop and assume lightning position NOW.","SAFE LOCATIONS: (1) Inside a substantial building (fully enclosed, not a picnic shelter). Stay away from windows, plumbing, appliances. (2) Inside a hard-top metal vehicle (car, truck, NOT motorcycle or convertible). Close windows. Don't touch metal. Lightning travels through the metal skin to ground. (3) If no shelter: low ground away from trees, avoid ridges/peaks, avoid water.","DANGEROUS LOCATIONS: (1) Open fields (you're the tallest object). (2) Under a tree (lightning strikes tree, current travels down trunk and through ground — kills people nearby). (3) In or near water (water conducts electricity — exit immediately). (4) On ridges or peaks (highest points). (5) Near isolated tall objects (flagpoles, towers, single trees). (6) In tents, picnic shelters, or open-sided structures (no protection).","LIGHTNING POSITION (last resort, open ground with no shelter): Crouch on balls of feet (minimize ground contact), heels together, head down, hands over ears. Do NOT lie flat — this maximizes ground contact. Do NOT put hands on ground. This position minimizes (but does not eliminate) ground current risk. Insulate: sit on a foam pad, backpack, coiled rope — anything non-conductive. Spread group members 15-20 feet apart (if one is struck, others can render aid).","GROUP PROTOCOL: If in a group, spread out 15-20 feet apart. If someone is struck, others are far enough away to help (and not be hit by ground current). Designate who will administer CPR if needed. Victims of lightning are NOT electrified — safe to touch immediately.","IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH — LIGHTNING STRIKE VICTIM: (1) Check for breathing and pulse. Lightning often stops the heart. START CPR IMMEDIATELY if no pulse (see CPR entry). (2) Lightning victims often recover if CPR is started quickly. (3) Check for burns (entry/exit wounds), fractures (concussive force can break bones), paralysis. (4) All lightning victims need medical evaluation (cardiac monitoring) even if they seem fine.","AVOIDING GROUND CURRENT: Most lightning injuries are from ground current, not direct strike. Current travels through ground in decreasing concentric circles from strike point. To minimize risk: (1) Keep feet together (reduces 'step potential' — current differential between your two feet). (2) Crouch on balls of feet. (3) Avoid long conductive objects on ground (fences, pipes, rails). (4) Stay away from groups of trees (strike one tree, current spreads to others).","STORM SHELTER SITE SELECTION (if camping in storm-prone area): Choose low-lying areas away from tall single trees. In forest, choose area with uniformly tall trees (lightning more likely to hit the tallest). Avoid ridge tops, peaks, and valleys prone to flash flooding. Pitch tent 2× the height of the nearest tree away from the tree base.","LONG-TERM CAMP LIGHTNING PROTECTION: A lightning rod system is possible: metal rod or tall pole, minimum 10 feet higher than your shelter, grounded with a wire running to ground (buried 6+ feet or to water). This diverts strikes away from the shelter. Requires copper wire or thick metal cable. Not practical for short-term survival but critical for permanent homesteads."]} ,
