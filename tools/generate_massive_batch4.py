(2) Caring for sick while protecting caregivers. (3) Maintaining essential services. Based on CDC and WHO pandemic preparedness guidelines. Lessons from COVID-19, influenza, and historical pandemics.','warnings':['Pandemics can overwhelm medical systems - most care will be home-based','Social breakdown can occur (supply chain disruption, civil unrest, violence)','Misinformation spreads during pandemics - rely on established public health guidance','Protecting caregivers is essential - if caregivers get sick, everyone suffers'],'steps':['ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE: ISOLATION - separate sick people from healthy. QUARANTINE - separate exposed people (not yet sick) for incubation period. Set up designated sick room in home if possible. Sick person stays in room, uses separate bathroom if possible, wears mask when around others. Caregivers use PPE (see below). Quarantine exposed individuals for 14 days (typical incubation for most respiratory viruses).','PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE): (1) MASK: N95 or equivalent (filters 95 percent of particles). Cloth masks provide some protection (better than nothing). (2) EYE PROTECTION: Goggles or face shield (viruses enter through eyes). (3) GLOVES: Disposable or washable. Change after contact with sick person. (4) GOWN/APRON: Cover clothing. Remove before leaving sick room. (5) HAND HYGIENE: Wash hands 20+ seconds with soap after every contact. Alcohol-based sanitizer (60 percent+ alcohol) if soap unavailable.','HOME CARE FOR SICK: (1) REST and FLUIDS. (2) Fever management (cooling measures, fluids). (3) Monitor breathing (respiratory distress requires urgent care if available). (4) Isolate waste (bag all used tissues, masks, gloves - dispose carefully or burn if possible). (5) Disinfect surfaces (bleach solution - 1 part bleach to 9 parts water). (6) Separate dishes/utensils or wash thoroughly with hot soapy water.','COMMUNITY RESPONSE: (1) Limit gatherings (social distancing reduces transmission). (2) Establish community health monitors (track cases, identify outbreaks). (3) Set up communal sick care if many are ill (dedicate building, trained volunteers in PPE). (4) Protect essential workers (food production, water, sanitation - these people get priority for PPE and vaccination if available). (5) Plan for supply disruption (stockpile food, water, fuel, medicine).','DIY PPE (when commercial unavailable): (1) Cloth masks from tightly-woven fabric (multiple layers). (2) Eye protection from clear plastic sheets. (3) Gowns from plastic bags or trash bags (cut arm holes). (4) Hand sanitizer from rubbing alcohol and aloe gel (mix 2parts alcohol to 1part aloe). Not as good as commercial PPE but better than nothing.','MENTAL HEALTH: Pandemics cause fear, isolation, grief (many deaths). Maintain communication (radio, messengers). Support grieving families. Establish routines. Provide accurate information to reduce panic.']})

(2) Power grid collapses. (3) Vehicles with electronic ignition may not start (older vehicles more likely to survive). (4) No phone, internet, radio, GPS. (5) Water pumps stop (city water fails within hours). SOLAR STORM (Carrington Event scale): Similar but slower onset. Electrical grid damaged by induced currents. CYBERATTACK/PHYSICAL GRID DAMAGE: Localized or cascading power failures.','FIRST 24 HOURS: (1) STAY HOME (roads will be chaotic - disabled vehicles, panicked people). (2) FILL CONTAINERS WITH WATER immediately (while pressure remains). Every container. Bathtubs, pots, bottles. (3) INVENTORY SUPPLIES: food, water, medicine, tools, weapons. (4) SECURE HOME: lock doors, arm yourself, establish watches. (5) ASSESS SITUATION: Is this local or widespread? How long might it last? Try battery-powered AM/FM radio (may still function).','WHAT STOPS WORKING: (1) Electricity. (2) Internet and cell phones. (3) Municipal water (pumps fail). (4) Sewage treatment. (5) Gas stations (pumps need power). (6) Refrigeration (food spoils). (7) Banking and electronic payments. (8) Most modern vehicles. (9) Medical devices (oxygen concentrators, insulin pumps, etc.). (10) Supply chains (food, medicine, fuel deliveries stop).','WHAT KEEPS WORKING: (1) Bicycles and older vehicles (pre-1980s more likely to survive EMP). (2) Hand tools. (3) Firearms and bows. (4) Manually-pumped wells. (5) Wood stoves. (6) Books and paper records. (7) Battery-powered flashlights/radios (if shielded or not connected during pulse). (8) Human knowledge and skills.','SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL (days to weeks): (1) WATER: Collect rainwater, find natural sources, purify (boil, filter, bleach). (2) FOOD: Eat perishables first, ration shelf-stable food. Forage, hunt, fish. (3) SECURITY: Form neighborhood watch. Arm and defend resources. Expect looting and violence. (4) SANITATION: Dig latrines away from water sources. Burn or bury waste. (5) COMMUNICATION: Establish foot/bike messengers. Ham radio (if equipment survived and you have operator).','LONG-TERM ADAPTATION (months to years): (1) AGRICULTURE: Plant gardens immediately. Raise animals. (2) COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION: Skills-based division of labor (farmers, hunters, builders, medics, guards). (3) ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: Solar panels (if survived), wind, hydro, manual power. (4) TRADE NETWORKS: Barter system. (5) SECURITY GROUPS: Mutual defense pacts with nearby communities. (6) EDUCATION: Preserve knowledge. Teach young people practical skills. (7) GOVERNANCE: Establish rules, conflict resolution, justice system.','LIKELIHOOD: Full-scale EMP or solar storm is low-probability but high-impact. More likely: regional grid failures from storms, attacks, infrastructure decay. Prepare for temporary disruptions (days to weeks) and you will be better prepared for worst-case permanent collapse.']})

(2) Identify danger zones (government buildings, police stations, major intersections, commercial areas). (3) Know multiple evacuation routes from home and work. (4) Have bug-out bag ready (see entry).','IF YOU ARE CAUGHT IN A RIOT: (1) LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. Do not spectate - riots turn violent without warning. (2) Move perpendicular to crowd flow (not against - you will be trampled). Head toward less crowded side streets. (3) Stay on feet (if you fall in a crowd, you will be trampled - protect head, try to stand). (4) Avoid police lines (tear gas, rubber bullets, arrests). (5) Enter buildings if possible (ask business owners for refuge). (6) Cover face (mask or cloth) to reduce tear gas exposure. (7) If tear gas: move upwind, rinse eyes with water (not milk - myth), breathe through wet cloth.','HOME DEFENSE DURING UNREST: (1) BARRICADE: Lock and reinforce doors. Board windows if possible. Move valuables away from windows. (2) LIGHTS: Keep lights off (do not advertise occupancy). Use flashlight only when necessary. (3) WEAPONS: Arm yourself. Position near entry points. Do not confront large groups - shoot only if they breach home. (4) FIRE WATCH: Molotov cocktails and arson are common. Have extinguisher or water buckets ready. If fire starts, evacuate immediately. (5) LOW PROFILE: Do not respond to provocation. Stay silent and hidden.','LOOTING DEFENSE: (1) Board windows and doors. (2) Place signs - NOT WORTH DYING FOR or WE HAVE NOTHING. (3) Do not shoot at looters unless they enter your home (escalation risk - crowds turn on defenders). (4) If overwhelmed, let them loot - possessions can be replaced, your life cannot.','WHEN TO EVACUATE: (1) Fire nearby (smell smoke, see flames). (2) Armed groups approaching home. (3) Police/military ordering evacuation. (4) Unrest spreading uncontrollably. EVACUATION: (1) Grab bug-out bag. (2) Use back exits (not front door - may be watched). (3) Move through alleys and yards (not main streets). (4) Head to pre-planned safe house (friend/family outside city) or rural area. (5) Travel in small group if possible (safety in numbers but harder to hide).','CHECKPOINTS: If you encounter police/military checkpoints: (1) COMPLY (hands visible, no sudden movements). (2) Have ID ready. (3) Answer questions calmly. (4) Do not argue or resist (survival is priority). If checkpoint is hostile (non-official, armed gangs): (1) AVOID if possible. (2) Turn back or take alternate route. (3) If unavoidable, comply, give up valuables, do not resist. (4) If they try to detain you (kidnapping risk), RUN if you see opportunity.']})
