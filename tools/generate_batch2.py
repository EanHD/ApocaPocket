Fast-moving water is immensely powerful — waist-deep current can sweep you off your feet. Proper crossing technique, site selection, and knowing when NOT to cross are life-saving skills.","warnings":["Water deeper than your knees or faster than walking pace is dangerous — consider not crossing","Cold water saps strength rapidly — even if shallow, cold water can incapacitate you mid-stream","Never tie yourself to a rope when crossing — if you fall, the rope pins you underwater and you drown","Crossing alone is extremely dangerous — if possible, wait for a group or better conditions"],"steps":["WHEN NOT TO CROSS: (1) Water opaque/muddy (cannot see bottom). (2) Debris or ice flowing in current. (3) Recent heavy rain (rivers are high and fast). (4) Glacial streams in afternoon (peak melt flow — cross in morning when lower). (5) If you would not confidently swim it, do not try to walk it. WAIT: rivers drop quickly after storms. Wait 12-24 hours if safe to do so.","SITE SELECTION: Look for: (1) Wide, shallow sections (wide = slower, shallow = safer). (2) Gravel bottom (avoid slippery rock). (3) Straight section (not bends — current is fastest on outside of bends). (4) Downstream clear of waterfalls, rapids, logjams, or undercut banks (in case you are swept away). (5) Scout 100m upstream and down. The effort is worth it.","PREPARATION: (1) Unbuckle pack straps (can shed pack if you fall). (2) Remove pants if deep (pants fill with water and drag you down). Boots ON (foot protection). (3) Use a wading staff (strong stick, chest-height, placed upstream for stability). (4) Secure critical gear (waterproof bag for electronics, documents, fire-starting materials).","SOLO CROSSING TECHNIQUE: (1) Face upstream at 45 degree angle to current. (2) Shuffle feet (do not lift — you will lose balance). (3) Move wading staff first, plant it upstream, transfer weight, then move feet. (4) If current is strong, move diagonally downstream (ferry angle) — do not fight the current, use it. (5) If you lose balance, drop pack immediately, float on back with feet downstream (protects head), swim to shore with current at an angle.","GROUP CROSSING (safest): (1) LINE ASTERN: cross single file, each person holds the person in fronts pack/shoulders. Strongest person leads, second-strongest at rear. Move together as a unit. (2) WEDGE: 3+ people form a wedge pointing upstream. Strongest person at apex breaks the current. Others follow in his wake. Link arms. (3) ROPED GROUP (if you have adequate rope and experience): anchor rope on shore, first person crosses with rope, secures on far side. Subsequent people clip in with carabiner, cross with rope as safety. This requires training.","CHILDREN/WEAK SWIMMERS: Carry small children in a chest carry (face-to-face hug). Weak swimmers: strongest member crosses first, sets rope, weak member clips in or crosses while holding rope.","IF YOU FALL: (1) Ditch pack immediately. (2) Roll onto back, feet downstream, toes up (protects head from rocks, feet absorb impacts). (3) Swim with current at 45 degree angle toward shore (ferrying technique). DO NOT try to stand in fast current — foot entrapment (foot wedges between rocks, current pushes you underwater) is fatal. (4) Only stand when current is slow and water is shin-deep.","COLD WATER CONSIDERATIONS: Water below 15C (60F) causes rapid heat loss. Symptoms: gasping, rapid breathing, loss of dexterity, confusion. After crossing: change into dry clothes immediately, wring out wet clothes, get active to generate heat, drink warm fluids. Hypothermia can develop even on a warm day if water is cold.","SWIM VS FORD DECISION: If river is too deep to ford but you MUST cross: SWIM it, do not wade. Swimming gives you control. Wading in deep fast water leads to falling, tumbling, panic. Swimming technique: enter upstream of your target landing, swim at 45 degree angle toward shore (current carries you downstream), crawl stroke with pack as flotation or ditch pack. Aim to land 50-100m downstream."]},

{"id":"l1-medical-cold-water-immersion","title":"Cold Water Immersion Survival — 1-10-1 Principle","category":"L1_immediate_survival","subtopic":"medical_first_aid","tags":["cold-water","immersion","hypothermia","drowning","rescue"],"region_relevance":["global","boreal","temperate"],"confidence":"high","sources":["cdc-hypothermia-frostbite","nols-wilderness-guide"],"related_entries":["l1-medical-hypothermia","l1-shelter-river-crossing"],"summary":"Cold water (below 15°C/60°F) kills fast. The 1-10-1 rule: 1 minute of cold shock (gasping, panic), 10 minutes of meaningful movement (swim to safety), 1 hour until unconsciousness. Most cold-water drowning victims die in the first minute from panic and gasping, NOT hypothermia. Knowing this saves lives.","warnings":["Cold water shock causes an involuntary gasp — if you go under during this, you aspirate water and drown immediately","People can look completely fine (treading water, talking) then suddenly go unconscious from hypothermia","Alcohol consumption before water exposure dramatically increases drowning risk","Wet clothing accelerates heat loss — even after exiting water, hypothermia continues if you don't change clothes"],"steps":["THE 1-10-1 RULE: MINUTE 1 — Cold shock: You gasp uncontrollably, hyperventilate, heart rate spikes. Panic. This is when most people drown. MINUTES 2-10 — Cold incapacitation: fingers go numb, swimming becomes uncoordinated, you lose fine motor skills. This is your window to self-rescue (swim to shore, grab flotation). MINUTES 10-60 — Hypothermia onset: core temperature drops, you become exhausted, mentally confused. After ~1 hour (varies by water temp and body size), you lose consciousness and drown.","IF YOU FALL INTO COLD WATER: (1) DON'T PANIC (easier said than done). The gasping will pass in 60 seconds. (2) FLIP onto your back immediately, head above water. Get control of your breathing. (3) ASSESS: Can you touch bottom? Is there something to grab (boat, log, ice edge)? How far to shore? (4) If close to shore (<10m): SWIM immediately while you still have dexterity. Strong, fast strokes. Don't try to remove clothing yet — swim first. (5) If far from shore: FLOAT and minimize movement (conserves heat and energy). Tuck into HELP position (Heat Escape Lessening Position): knees to chest, arms wrapped around legs. Wait for rescue. (6) Call for help if anyone can hear.","SWIM VS WAIT DECISION: SWIM if: shore is close (<25m), no rescue coming, you're in current heading toward worse danger (waterfall, rapids). WAIT/FLOAT if: shore is far, rescue is coming, water is calm, you have flotation (PFD, pack, log). Swimming produces heat but also circulates cold water against skin — in very cold water (<5°C), swimming can hasten hypothermia.","GETTING OUT: (1) Exit water as fast as possible. (2) If ice: don't stand on edge (it breaks). Kick legs to get horizontal, spread arms wide, pull yourself onto ice like a seal. Once on ice, roll away from hole (distributes weight). (3) If shore: crawl out, move away from water edge.","IMMEDIATE POST-IMMERSION: (1) GET OUT OF WET CLOTHES immediately. Wring out if no dry clothes available. (2) Insulate (dry clothes, sleeping bag, emergency blanket, even leaves/moss). (3) Cover head (huge heat loss from head). (4) Gradual rewarming: body-to-body contact with another person (skin to skin in sleeping bag), warm fluids (NOT hot), gentle movement. NO hot bath (causes dangerous cardiac effects). (5) Treat for hypothermia (see entry).","RESCUE OF COLD-WATER VICTIM: (1) Get them out of water using reaching pole, throw rope, or boat — DO NOT enter water yourself (you become a second victim). (2) Handle gently (rough handling can trigger cardiac arrest in hypothermic patients). (3) Remove wet clothing. (4) Horizontal position (lying down — standing can cause blood pressure drop and collapse). (5) Insulate and rewarm. (6) CPR if no pulse (see CPR entry). Hypothermic victims can survive prolonged submersion — continue resuscitation until they're warm and still not responsive.","PREVENTION: (1) Wear a PFD (life jacket) near cold water — keeps you afloat during cold shock. (2) Don't drink alcohol before boating/water activities. (3) Learn to swim. (4) File a float plan (tell someone where you're going, when you'll return). (5) Carry emergency kit (dry clothes in waterproof bag, fire-starting materials, emergency blanket). (6) Practice cold-shock breathing control: cold shower exposure (60 seconds under cold water) teaches your body to suppress the gasp reflex.","WATER TEMPERATURE SURVIVAL TIMES (rough estimates): 0°C (32°F, ice water): <15 minutes. 5°C (41°F): 30-60 minutes. 10°C (50°F): 1-2 hours. 15°C (60°F): 2-4 hours. 20°C (68°F): 6-12 hours. These are for exhaustion/unconsciousness — death follows shortly after. Actual time depends on body size, clothing, activity level."} ,

{"id":"l1-shelter-avalanche-survival","title":"Avalanche Survival & Escape","category":"L1_immediate_survival","subtopic":"shelter","tags":["avalanche","snow","mountains","safety","burial"],"region_relevance":["alpine","boreal","mountainous"],"confidence":"medium","sources":["nols-wilderness-guide","us-army-fm-4-25-11"],"related_entries":["l1-medical-hypothermia","l1-strategy-environment-profiles"],"summary":"Avalanches kill 150+ people globally each year. Survival depends on: not triggering one (terrain assessment), escaping if caught (swimming motions), surviving burial (air pocket, calm breathing). If buried >15 minutes without an air pocket, survival is rare. Prevention is everything.","warnings":["Most avalanche victims trigger the slide themselves — you are the hazard","Avalanches move 80+ mph — you cannot outrun one downhill. Your only chance is to escape to the side.","Buried victims have 15 minutes before survival rate drops to 30% (asphyxiation) — every second of rescue time matters","Electronic avalanche beacons (transceivers) are the only reliable way to find buried victims — without them, rescue is nearly hopeless"],"steps":["AVALANCHE TERRAIN RECOGNITION: Slopes 30-45° are most dangerous (steeper = snow sloughs off naturally, flatter = not steep enough to slide). RED FLAGS: recent heavy snow (>12 inches in 24 hours), wind-loaded slopes (lee side of ridges), warming temps after cold period, slopes with previous slide paths, slopes above you (avalanches run downhill), convex slopes (tension on snow). SAFE: ridges, dense forest, flat ground, slopes <25° or >50°.","TERRAIN AVOIDANCE: Travel on ridges when possible (avalanches happen on slopes below you). If you must cross a slope: one person at a time, stay high (near ridge), move quickly, establish safe zones (islands of trees, rocks). Avoid being in a gully or depression (avalanches channel into these). Never stop in the middle of a slope.","IF AN AVALANCHE STARTS: (1) YELL to warn others. (2) TRY TO ESCAPE TO THE SIDE — slide edges move slower than center. Run, ski, or crawl diagonally uphill and outward. (3) If caught, FIGHT TO STAY ON THE SURFACE — 'swimming' motions, backstroke, rolling. Discard poles, skis, pack (they drag you deeper). (4) As motion slows, MAKE AN AIR POCKET — thrust one arm upward (rescuers might see it), cup other hand over mouth/nose. Take a HUGE breath before snow hardens (avalanche snow sets like concrete).","BURIED VICTIM SURVIVAL: (1) CONSERVE AIR — slow, calm breathing. Panic uses oxygen fast. (2) Determine which way is up: spit — if it runs toward your face, you're upside down. Or wait — usually the heavier snow is below you. (3) Try to dig toward surface if you're close (light visible, hand breaks through). (4) If deep, stay calm and wait for rescue. Yelling wastes air and sound doesn't travel through snow. (5) Create space around face if possible (move head side to side before snow hardens).","RESCUE PROTOCOL (you witness a burial): (1) Mark last-seen point (stick, pole, piece of gear). (2) Check for other hazards (is a second slide coming?). (3) Turn on avalanche beacon to RECEIVE mode (if you have beacons). (4) Begin systematic search from last-seen point downhill in the fall line. Look for visual clues (gear, clothing, body parts). (5) Use probe poles (ski poles, sticks) to poke snow in grid pattern. (6) Dig frantically when located — clear airway first, then body. Speed is everything.","NO BEACON RESCUE: Without transceivers, finding buried victims is extremely difficult. METHOD: (1) Visual search of debris field. (2) Listen for muffled calls. (3) Probe in likely areas (where debris piles up — bends, obstacles, toe of slide). (4) This rarely succeeds unless burial is very shallow. Sobering reality: without beacons, most buried victims die.","AFTER EXTRACTION: (1) Clear airway of snow. (2) Check breathing/pulse. CPR if needed. (3) Treat for hypothermia (see entry). (4) Handle gently (trauma common — broken bones, internal injuries). (5) Evacuate to medical care — even if they seem fine, internal injuries may be present.","PREVENTION GEAR: (1) Avalanche beacon (transceiver) — ESSENTIAL in avalanche terrain. Everyone in party must have one, practice using them. (2) Probe pole (collapsible pole for probing snow). (3) Shovel (lightweight snow shovel). (4) Avalanche airbag pack (inflates to keep you on surface — expensive but effective). (5) Training (avalanche safety course). Prevention is 1000× better than rescue."} ,

# PNW Plants (12 entries covering the major edible plants of the Pacific Northwest)

Dark purple berries, similar to blueberries but mealier. Harvest August-October. Highly productive — one patch can yield gallons. Indigenous peoples made pemmican and fruit leather from salal.","warnings":["Salal berries are edible raw but somewhat bland and mealy — better cooked or dried","Heavy consumption can cause mild constipation (high tannin content)","Very similar plants (Oregon grape) are also edible but more tart — learn to distinguish","Salal leaves are tough and evergreen — do not eat leaves"],"steps":["IDENTIFICATION: Evergreen shrub, 1-6 feet tall, forms dense thickets. LEAVES: thick, glossy, oval, alternate along stem, 2-4 inches long. FLOWERS: white-pink, bell-shaped, hanging clusters (May-July). BERRIES: dark blue-purple, round, 1/4 inch, mealy texture, slightly sweet. HABITAT: Under conifer forests (Douglas fir, cedar), coastal areas, sea level to mid-elevations. Abundant west of Cascades.","HARVEST: July-October (peak in August). Berries ripen unevenly — pick the darkest ones. Pull gently (berries separate from stem easily). One productive bush can yield 1-2 quarts. Bushes fruit heavily in sunny openings.","USES: (1) Raw (mildly sweet, mealy). (2) Dried (make fruit leather — mash berries, spread thin on bark or cloth, sun-dry for 2-3 days. Roll into scrolls. Lasts 6-12 months). (3) Cooked in stews (adds thickness and subtle flavor). (4) Mashed and mixed with fat to make pemmican. (5) Tea from leaves (astringent, traditional remedy for sore throat).","NUTRITIONAL VALUE: Moderate vitamin C, high tannins, some antioxidants. Calorie-dense when dried. Indigenous peoples relied on salal as a winter food source (berries dried and stored).","LOOK-ALIKES: OREGON GRAPE (Mahonia): also edible, but leaves are spiny holly-like, berries are bright blue and VERY tart. RED HUCKLEBERRY: red or purple berries, smaller, sweeter. Both safe."} ,

For larger quantities, bring a shallow container lined with cloth.","USES: (1) Raw (excellent flavor — sweet with slight tartness). (2) Jam (cook immediately after picking — they spoil quickly). (3) Syrup (boil with sugar or honey). (4) LEAVES: young leaves (spring) can be cooked like spinach. Large mature leaves used as plates or wrapping for cooking.","NUTRITIONAL VALUE: High vitamin C, moderate sugars. Low calorie density (mostly water).
