Based on military evasion tactics and refugee experiences. Priorities: stay hidden, move at night, avoid official checkpoints, find safe passage.','warnings':['Border crossing is illegal in most situations - weigh risks of capture vs staying','Refugees are vulnerable to exploitation, violence, trafficking','Children and elderly are at highest risk during displacement','Governments may detain, deport, or harm refugees'],'steps':['DECISION TO LEAVE: Leave early if possible (before borders close, before roads clogged). PACK LIGHT: Water, food for 3-7 days, weather-appropriate clothing, cash/valuables (gold, jewelry - portable wealth), documents in waterproof bag, small first aid kit, sturdy shoes. WEIGHT LIMIT: 15-20 lbs max (must walk long distances).','TRAVEL TACTICS: (1) MOVE AT NIGHT: Lower risk of detection. Use moonlight or red-filtered flashlight (preserves night vision). (2) AVOID ROADS: Use trails, ridgelines, streambeds. Roads have checkpoints, bandits, military. (3) COVER TRACKS: Walk on hard ground or in water when possible. Brush out footprints. (4) STAY HIDDEN BY DAY: Sleep in dense vegetation, caves, abandoned buildings. Post watch (someone awake at all times). (5) SMALL GROUPS: 3-5 people ideal. Larger groups attract attention, slower. Lone travel is dangerous (no backup, vulnerable to attack).','BORDER CROSSING: OFFICIAL: If possible, use legal border crossing (safer but may be denied entry, detained, or turned back). Have documents ready, story consistent. UNOFFICIAL: (1) Scout crossing area during day from concealment. Identify patrol patterns, fences, sensors. (2) Cross at night, during weather (rain/snow reduces visibility), or during shift changes (guards less alert). (3) Cut/dig under fence if necessary (use wire cutters, fold sharp edges). (4) Avoid rivers (strong current, cold water, drowning risk) unless no alternative. (5) Once across, move quickly away from border (patrols focus near border).','AVOIDING DETECTION: (1) No fires (smoke visible for miles). Eat cold food. (2) No lights at night. (3) Minimize talking (sound carries). Use hand signals. (4) Camouflage (natural colors, break up silhouette with branches/mud). (5) If pursued, move through thick vegetation, water (breaks scent trail for dogs), rocky areas (no tracks).','ENCOUNTERING HOSTILES: (1) AVOID CONTACT whenever possible (hide, wait for them to pass). (2) If confronted by officials: COMPLY (hands visible, no sudden moves). Expect detention or deportation. (3) If confronted by criminals/militias: SURRENDER VALUABLES. Do not resist (not worth your life). If they attempt to detain/kidnap you, LOOK FOR ESCAPE OPPORTUNITY (when distracted, at night, when group splits up). (4) If attacked: RUN toward dense cover. Zigzag running pattern (harder to hit). Throw belongings behind you (may distract pursuers).','SAFE HAVEN: (1) Refugee camps (UNHCR camps provide food, shelter, medical care but conditions are often poor and dangerous). (2) Churches, mosques, temples (may offer sanctuary). (3) NGOs and aid organizations. (4) Friends or family in safe country. (5) Rural areas away from conflict (harder to reach but less scrutiny).','LONG-TERM: Displaced persons often live in camps or undocumented in cities for years. Priorities: (1) Documentation (refugee status, asylum claim). (2) Income (under-the-table work). (3) Children education. (4) Community support (other refugees from your country/region).']})

Immediate survival: shelter in place for 24-72 hours in a thick-walled structure. Minimize radiation exposure. Based on CDC and FEMA nuclear emergency guidelines.','warnings':['Nuclear war would cause civilization collapse - this entry covers IMMEDIATE survival only','Radiation sickness is dose-dependent - no amount is safe but time/distance/shielding reduce exposure','Fallout is most dangerous in first 24-48 hours (decays exponentially)','Iodine pills (KI) only protect thyroid from radioiodine - not a general radiation cure'],'steps':['IMMEDIATE ACTION (within 10 minutes of detonation): (1) GET INSIDE immediately. Any building is better than outside. (2) GO TO BASEMENT or center of building (farthest from outside walls/roof). (3) CLOSE DOORS AND WINDOWS. Turn off ventilation (prevents fallout particles entering). (4) REMOVE OUTER CLOTHING (fallout particles on clothing). Place in plastic bag, seal, move away from living area. (5) SHOWER if possible (washes off fallout particles) - do not scrub hard (damages skin), use lukewarm water, shampoo hair. (6) STAY INSIDE for at least 24 hours (preferably 48-72 hours). Radiation decays rapidly - after 48 hours, radiation is 1 percent of initial level.','SHELTER SELECTION: BEST: Basement of large multi-story concrete building (thick walls and floors above provide shielding). GOOD: Center rooms of single-story concrete/brick building. Interior rooms (bathrooms, closets). POOR: Wood-frame house (some protection, better than nothing). WORST: Vehicles, tents, outside. SHIELDING PRINCIPLE: Dense material blocks radiation. Earth, concrete, water, lead. More mass between you and fallout = less radiation exposure.','IMPROVISED SHIELDING: If shelter is inadequate, improve it: (1) Pile dense objects around shelter area (books, furniture, water containers, bags of dirt/sand). (2) Stay in center of shelter (farthest from walls/roof). (3) Seal windows and vents with plastic sheeting and tape (reduces fallout entry).','SUPPLIES: (1) WATER: Store as much as possible before fallout arrives (fill every container - bathtubs, sinks, bottles). Municipal water may become contaminated. (2) FOOD: Sealed food is safe (canned, boxed). Wash outer packaging. Do not eat fresh food exposed to fallout. (3) RADIO: Battery-powered or hand-crank. Listen for official instructions. (4) Sanitation: Plastic bags for waste (cannot go outside to use bathroom).','WHEN TO LEAVE SHELTER: (1) Official all-clear (radio broadcast). (2) After 48-72 hours if no information (radiation has decayed significantly). (3) Life-threatening emergency (fire, structural collapse, medical emergency). IF YOU MUST GO OUTSIDE: (1) Cover all skin (long sleeves, pants, gloves, mask or cloth over mouth/nose, hat). (2) Move quickly. (3) Return to shelter, remove all clothing outside, shower.','RADIATION SICKNESS SYMPTOMS: MILD (1-2 Sv dose): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea within hours. Recovery in weeks. MODERATE (2-6 Sv): Severe nausea, hair loss, bleeding, infections. Possible death without medical care. LETHAL (over 6 Sv): Rapid onset symptoms, internal bleeding, organ failure. Death within days to weeks. NO FIELD TREATMENT exists. Minimize exposure is only prevention.','DECONTAMINATION: (1) Remove clothing (removes 90 percent of fallout contamination). (2) Gentle shower with soap. (3) Wash hair (do not use conditioner - binds particles). (4) Blow nose, wipe eyelids and ears with damp cloth. (5) Put on clean clothes from inside shelter. (6) Contaminated items: bag and seal, move away from living area. Do not handle unnecessarily.','LONG-TERM (after initial fallout): (1) Avoid contaminated areas (government will map hotspots). (2) Decontaminate property (wash surfaces, remove topsoil). (3) Monitor food and water (government tests for contamination). (4) Evacuate if instructed. (5) Medical screening (check for radiation exposure, cancer risk). Recovery will take years to decades.']})

Triage sorts victims by priority: who needs immediate care, who can wait, who is beyond help. START (Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment) is the standard system. Goal: save the most lives with limited resources.','warnings':['Triage decisions are brutal - you may classify saveable people as dead to save others','Requires emotional detachment - family members cannot triage their own loved ones','Wrong triage kills people - undertriage (miss serious injuries) or overtriage (waste resources on minor injuries)','START is for adults - JumpSTART system exists for children'],'steps':['TRIAGE CATEGORIES: (1) GREEN (MINOR): Walking wounded. Minor injuries. Can wait hours for care. (2) YELLOW (DELAYED): Serious injuries but stable. Need care within hours. (3) RED (IMMEDIATE): Life-threatening injuries but saveable with rapid care. Priority for treatment. (4) BLACK (EXPECTANT/DEAD): Dead or injuries too severe to survive with available resources. Do not treat (brutal but necessary in mass casualty).','START TRIAGE PROCESS (30 seconds per victim): STEP 1 - WALKING: Yell ANYONE WHO CAN WALK, MOVE TO [location]. Anyone who walks is GREEN (minor). STEP 2 - BREATHING: Assess non-walkers. Is victim breathing? If NO: open airway (head tilt-chin lift). If starts breathing: RED (immediate). If does NOT breathe: BLACK (dead). If YES (breathing): proceed to step 3. STEP 3 - RESPIRATORY RATE: Count breaths for 15 seconds. Under 30 per minute: proceed to step 4. Over 30 per minute: RED (immediate - respiratory distress). STEP 4 - CIRCULATION: Check radial pulse (wrist). Strong pulse: proceed to step 5. Weak or no radial pulse: RED (immediate - shock). STEP 5 - MENTAL STATUS: Can victim follow simple commands? (Squeeze my hand, stick out your tongue.) YES: YELLOW (delayed - serious injuries but stable). NO: RED (immediate - altered mental status indicates severe injury).','TAGGING: Mark triage category on victim (write on forehead with marker, attach colored ribbon, or use commercial triage tags). Prevents re-triaging same person.','TREATMENT PRIORITIES: (1) Treat all RED patients first (life-threatening but saveable). (2) When all RED patients are stabilized or resources exhausted, treat YELLOW. (3) Comfort BLACK patients but do not use medical resources. (4) GREEN patients self-care or help others. (5) RE-TRIAGE periodically (patients can deteriorate - YELLOW becomes RED).','SPECIFIC LIFE-SAVING INTERVENTIONS (for RED patients): (1) BLEEDING: Direct pressure, tourniquets (see entry). (2) AIRWAY: Open airway, clear obstructions, recovery position. (3) BREATHING: Rescue breaths if not breathing. Seal sucking chest wounds. (4) SHOCK: Lie flat, elevate legs, keep warm. Do not spend time on complicated procedures (IVs, splinting, wound care) until all RED patients addressed.','EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES: (1) Screaming victims get attention but may not be most critical. (2) Quiet victims may be dying (altered mental status, shock). (3) Children are heartbreaking but follow same triage rules. (4) Helpers need breaks and emotional support. Rotate triage officers. (5) Expect anger from families (why is my loved one BLACK?). Stay calm, explain triage logic.','WHEN TO RE-TRIAGE: (1) New resources arrive (more medical personnel, ambulances). (2) Situation stabilizes (all immediate threats treated). (3) BLACK patients may be re-evaluated if resources become available (but this is rare in true mass casualty).']})

May be official (military, police) or unofficial (militias, gangs, bandits). Survival priorities: assess threat level, comply or evade based on risk, negotiate if possible. Based on military survival training.','warnings':['Checkpoints are unpredictable - even official ones can be dangerous','Armed groups at checkpoints may rob, detain, assault, or kill travelers','Running from checkpoint risks being shot','Bribes may be expected but also mark you as a target'],'steps':['CHECKPOINT IDENTIFICATION: From distance, assess: (1) OFFICIAL: Uniformed personnel, vehicles, barriers, flags, organized setup. Generally safer (unless corrupt regime). (2) UNOFFICIAL: Mixed clothing, improvised barriers, lack of organization. HIGH RISK - likely criminals or militia. (3) AMBUSH: No visible checkpoint, people hiding, obstacles blocking road. EXTREME RISK - prepare to flee. (4) ABANDONED: No personnel. May be safe to pass or could be ambush/trap.','DECISION TREE: OFFICIAL CHECKPOINT (government/military): COMPLY (approach slowly, hands visible, no sudden moves). Have ID and documents ready. Answer questions. Expect searches. Bribes may be required. UNOFFICIAL CHECKPOINT (armed civilians): EXTREME CAUTION. Options: (1) Turn around if not yet committed. (2) Approach with extreme caution if no alternative route. Be prepared to give up valuables. Do not resist. (3) If they attempt to detain you (kidnapping risk), look for escape opportunity. AMBUSH: DO NOT APPROACH. Turn around or drive off-road if possible. If fired upon, accelerate through or flee into cover.','APPROACHING CHECKPOINT: (1) SLOW DOWN well before checkpoint (sudden braking looks suspicious). (2) TURN ON INTERIOR LIGHTS (night time - shows you are not hiding anything). (3) HANDS VISIBLE (both hands on steering wheel, or raised if walking). (4) NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS (reaching for documents - tell them first - I am reaching for my ID in my pocket). (5) OBEY COMMANDS immediately. (6) STAY CALM (nervousness is normal but excessive fear looks suspicious).','INTERACTION: (1) BE POLITE (yes sir, no sir). Do not argue or show disrespect. (2) ANSWER QUESTIONS simply and consistently. Do not volunteer extra information. (3) DOCUMENTS: Have ID, vehicle registration, travel permits ready. (4) SEARCHES: Allow searches without complaint. Do not touch searchers or make them feel threatened. (5) BRIBES: If requested, negotiate calmly (I only have X amount). Pay if reasonable and refusal risks harm.','RED FLAGS (signs checkpoint is extremely dangerous): (1) Demand you exit vehicle with hands up. (2) Separate family members. (3) Ask where your money/valuables are (robbery intent). (4) Intoxicated or erratic behavior. (5) No clear reason for stop (just harassment). If you see red flags: (1) Comply but stay alert for escape opportunity. (2) Do not resist. (3) If they try to force you away from vehicle or into building (kidnapping/execution risk), RUN if you see any chance. Better to risk being shot while running than certain death.','ESCAPE FROM CHECKPOINT: (1) Vehicle: If not yet stopped, hard U-turn or off-road. Accelerate. Zigzag driving (harder to hit). Sacrifice vehicle if necessary (flee on foot). (2) On foot: Run toward dense cover (buildings, forest). Zigzag. Throw valuables behind you (may distract pursuers). Do not look back (slows you down). (3) After escape: Hide for hours (they may search area). Change direction multiple times. Avoid roads.','AVOIDING CHECKPOINTS: (1) Scout routes in advance (ask locals where checkpoints are). (2) Use back roads, trails, or cross-country travel. (3) Travel at times checkpoints are less active (early morning, meal times). (4) Locals often know safe passages - hire guide if possible.']})

Small groups (under 10 people) use concealment and evasion. Larger communities (50+ people) can defend territory. Priorities: early warning, hardened perimeter, armed guards, discipline. Based on military small-unit tactics.','warnings':['Armed defense attracts attention - may invite attack from better-armed groups','Killing in self-defense has psychological consequences - expect trauma','Defending a location ties you to that location (cannot easily retreat)','Internal conflict over resources and authority is common - establish clear rules early'],'steps':['DEFENSE STRATEGY BY GROUP SIZE: SMALL (2-10 people): AVOID CONFLICT. Stay hidden. Scatter if attacked. Fight only if cornered. MEDIUM (10-30 people): DEFEND TEMPORARY CAMPS. Hardened position, armed watch, but ready to retreat if overmatched. LARGE (50+ people): DEFEND TERRITORY. Establish perimeter, multiple guard posts, fortifications. Can repel small attacks but still vulnerable to large organized groups or government forces.','PERIMETER SECURITY: (1) CLEAR FIELDS OF FIRE: Remove vegetation, obstacles in 100m zone around perimeter (attackers have no cover). (2) BARRIERS: Fences (barbed wire, chain-link), walls (stacked materials, earth berms), trenches, abatis (sharpened stakes). Goal: slow attackers, funnel them into kill zones. (3) MULTIPLE LAYERS: Outer perimeter (early warning), inner perimeter (hardened defense), safe zone (civilians, supplies).','GUARD POSTS: (1) ELEVATED: Height provides visibility and defensive advantage. Use buildings, towers, or platforms. (2) COVERED: Sandbags, walls, or natural cover protect guards from fire. (3) COMMUNICATION: Guards need way to alert others (radio, whistle, bell, runner). (4) OVERLAPPING FIELDS OF FIRE: Multiple guard posts can cover same area (no blind spots). (5) ROTATION: 4-hour shifts max (longer = fatigue, mistakes). Rotate guards through posts.','WATCH SCHEDULE: (1) 24/7 COVERAGE: Always have guards on duty (attacks often come at night or dawn). (2) SHIFT HANDOFF: Outgoing guard briefs incoming (what happened, anything unusual, sector status). (3) REST: Guards need 8+ hours rest between shifts. Sleep deprivation kills alertness.','EARLY WARNING: (1) SENTRIES: Place guards on roads/trails leading to community (500m+ out). They report approaching threats and fall back to main perimeter. (2) ALARMS: Trip wires with bells/cans, dogs (bark at strangers), motion sensors (if power available). (3) PATROLS: Send armed patrols to scout surrounding area (daily or when threat increases). Do not send less than 3 people (safety in numbers).','RESPONSE TO ATTACK: (1) SOUND ALARM (all guards and armed defenders respond). (2) CIVILIANS TO SAFE ZONE (pre-designated shelter - basement, center of compound). (3) DEFENDERS TO POSITIONS (pre-assigned sectors - everyone knows their role). (4) ENGAGE ATTACKERS: Defenders fire from cover. Aim for center mass. Conserve ammunition (do not spray and pray). (5) RETREAT IF OVERMATCHED: If attackers break perimeter or have overwhelming firepower, sound retreat signal. Everyone falls back to rally point (pre-designated location outside community). Do not stand and die defending supplies.','DEFENSE DISCIPLINE: (1) RULES OF ENGAGEMENT: When do guards shoot? (Warning first? Shoot on sight?) Clear rules prevent accidents and hesitation. (2) AMMUNITION CONTROL: Centrally stored, distributed per shift. Prevents waste and theft. (3) FIRE DISCIPLINE: Shoot only on command or clear threat. Random shots alert enemies and waste ammo. (4) ACCOUNTABILITY: Guards who sleep on duty or abandon post endanger everyone (severe punishment necessary). (5) TRAINING: Regular drills (alarm response, defensive positions, retreat). Practice makes perfect.','AVOIDING SIEGE: Defenders have advantage in short engagements but lose in prolonged siege (attackers can wait, starve you out). Strategies: (1) STOCKPILE: Months of food, water, ammo. (2) NEGOTIATE: Offer tribute (pay off attackers) or alliance (join larger group). (3) PREEMPTIVE RETREAT: If overwhelmed force approaches, evacuate before siege begins. Territory is not worth dying for.']})

SELECT: Young, fit, trustworthy individuals. Memorize messages (written messages can be captured and read). PAIRS: Send two runners (if one is injured/captured, other continues). ROUTES: Scouts identify safe routes between locations. Change routes periodically (avoid ambush). TIMING: Establish expected arrival times (if runner is late, assume captured or ambushed). AUTHENTICATION: Runners carry token or password to prove identity (prevents infiltration).','VISUAL SIGNALS: (1) SMOKE: Daytime signal. Black smoke (burn rubber, oil) or white smoke (wet green material). Number of puffs = code (1 puff = all clear, 2 puffs = danger, 3 puffs = attack). Range: 5-10 miles in clear weather. (2) FIRE: Nighttime signal. Large bonfire visible for miles. (3) MIRRORS: Reflect sunlight (signal mirror or improvised from glass). Flash code (Morse or agreed-upon pattern). Range: 10+ miles. (4) FLAGS: Daytime signal. Color-coded flags (red = danger, white = all clear, etc.). Raised on poles. Range: line of sight (1-3 miles). (5) LIGHTS: Nighttime. Flashlight flashes (Morse code). Range: 1-5 miles depending on terrain.','SOUND SIGNALS: (1) BELLS/GONGS: Loud, carries far. Number of strikes = code. Range: 1-3 miles. (2) GUNSHOTS: Loud but wastes ammunition. Pattern of shots (1-2-3) = specific meaning. Range: 5+ miles. (3) WHISTLES: Personal signaling (guard alerting others). Range: 1/2 mile. (4) DRUMS: Rhythmic patterns carry far. Traditional communication in many cultures. Range: 3-5 miles. (5) HORNS/SIRENS: Very loud if you have functional device. Air horn, vehicle horn, etc.','HAM RADIO: If equipment survives EMP or you have shielded devices: (1) LICENSE: Not required in emergency but operation requires technical knowledge. (2) EQUIPMENT: Transceiver, antenna, power (battery, solar, generator). (3) FREQUENCY: Monitor emergency frequencies (146.52 MHz common VHF simplex). (4) RANGE: VHF/UHF line of sight (10-50 miles). HF long-distance (hundreds to thousands of miles with right conditions). (5) SECURITY: Radio is NOT secure. Anyone with receiver can hear. Use code words or pre-arranged meanings. (6) OPERATORS: Ham radio operators are valuable resource in disaster (experienced communicators).','ESTABLISHING COMM NETWORK: (1) DESIGNATE COMM HUB (central location receives and relays messages). (2) SCHEDULED CHECK-INS: Outlying posts report to hub at set times daily (morning and evening). If post misses check-in, send runner to investigate. (3) MESSAGE PRIORITY: Emergency (immediate - attack, fire, injury), Routine (can wait hours - supply request, info). (4) REDUNDANCY: Use multiple methods (runner + signal) for critical messages. (5) LOGS: Keep written record of all messages sent/received (tracks info, identifies patterns).','CODES AND ENCRYPTION: (1) BREVITY CODES: Numbers = pre-arranged meanings (Code 1 = all clear, Code 2 = minor incident, Code 3 = attack). Fast and reduces transmission time. (2) SUBSTITUTION: Replace sensitive words (do not say food, say winter supplies). (3) ONE-TIME PADS: Advanced encryption if you have training and materials (secure but complex). (4) AUTHENTICATION: Include code word in every message to verify sender (prevents false messages from enemies).']})
