Hand-building techniques (pinch, coil, slab) require no wheel. Pit firing (campfire or earth kiln) achieves temps needed to harden clay. Primitive pottery is porous but functional.','warnings':['Pottery can crack or explode during firing if dried improperly or contains air bubbles','Pit-fired pottery is porous - not fully waterproof unless sealed with pitch or oil','Large thick pieces are prone to cracking - start small and thin'],'steps':['CLAY PREP: Use tested clay (see clay ID entry). Wedge clay (knead like dough) to remove air bubbles. Add temper (sand 10-20 percent).','HAND-BUILDING: PINCH POT - Start with ball, press thumb into center, pinch walls thin while rotating. COIL - Roll clay into ropes, stack in spiral, smooth joins. SLAB - Flatten clay, cut shapes, join edges. Start with simple bowl or cup.','DRYING: CRITICAL. Dry SLOWLY (days to weeks) in shade. Fast drying causes cracks. Cover with plastic, uncover for few hours daily. Bone dry = ready to fire (no cool feel, very light).','PIT FIRING: Dig shallow pit. Build fire, let burn to coals. Place dried pottery in coals. Cover with more fuel (wood, dung). Fire for 4-8 hours. Let cool completely overnight. Pottery should be hard, ring when tapped.
